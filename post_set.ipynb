       " {'post': 'I\\'m welcoming all suggestions and comments.  I just need some sound advice.  I have a DD who is 2.  She is very smart, tall for her age, speaks in complete sentences, etc.  She appears to be 3 instead of just turning 2.  She goes to daycare full-time.  It\\'s an in-home daycare with only one other child there.....a boy (Andy) who is one year old.  A few weeks ago she came home with a red mark under her eye and I asked about it.  Daycare mother said the little boy had hit her with a toy.  Okay, no big deal.  Then she mentioned that my DD likes to push Andy down.  I don\\'t have any friends with children, so the only time my DD is around other kids is at daycare.  So, yesterday when I got to daycare to pick my child up, my daycare mother says that Andy\\'s mom wants to talk to me.  She was on the floor playing with the children.  I said, what\\'s wrong?  She said \"Your DD is abusing Andy again.\"  I said what happened?  She said that while the daycare mother was fixing lunch she left them to play in the playroom and she heard Andy screaming.  She went in to find him on the floor and as the day went on a black eye appeared.  I was confused as to what exactly I was supposed to do next.  So finally I said well if I had been here, I would have corrected her, but I wasn\\'t here.  5 hours later is not the time, in my opinion, to correct something.  I told the daycare mother that I was not opposed to her putting my DD in time out.  And I thought she had told me she put her in time out before.  I\\'m really at my wits end with this situation.  Am I not doing what needs to be done?  I feel that I\\'m paying (good money) for my child to be taken care of while I\\'m at work and I\\'m not sure what is going on.  Why am I being blamed for something when I\\'m at work?  Is this a stage that my DD is going through?  Are they around each other so much, it\\'s like a brother/sister situation?  I just feel that the daycare mother should not have the parents approaching each other at the end of the day.  Please comment.  I really need some input.\\n25 views and no opinions.  Okay.\\n\\nWell to add to the story, I called to check in today and the mom of Andy dropped him off this moring and said, \"apparently Andy gets more discipline at home than she (DD) does.\"  Her child is ONE.  Mine is TWO.  They are children and still learning right from wrong.  Telling them once doesn\\'t do the trick.\\n\\nOpinions please.\\nDS goes to a large daycare center and at that age there were 6-8 kids in his group.  IMO, the daycare provider is the one who should be speaking to you about this NOT the other parent.  The daycare provider should also be ready to anticipate the behavior.  Example would be biting -- usually there are signs that a child is going to bite someone else and the key is to avoid that behavior by distracting the child.   The reason I mention biting is because DS was both victim AND biter for a brief period of time in his daycare career.\\n\\nChildren this age, don\\'t quite understand the concept of causing pain.  They\\'re forever getting into trouble for not being gentle, for pulling the family pets ears or tail, pinching, biting....\\n\\nIMO, ignore the other mom. If she\\'s unhappy with the daycare then maybe she should look elsewhere instead of attacking you and your parenting.\\nThanks for the reply.  At least I know I\\'m not the \"bad\" one in the situation.  You made me feel better.  I really needed to hear that.  Thanks again.\\nI completely agree 100% with everything the other poster said.\\n\\nDaycare mother should be anticipating some of this behavior at this particular age.  I understand that we cannot always be in the same room; however, request that she is with your dd for your own sanity.  Or take Andy with her (since he is the younger one).\\n\\nThere is a huge age gap between one and two years old.  By now, your daughter knows what she wants and is willing to exert some force to get it.  Sounds like Andy is the innocent bystander...and he can\\'t really defend himself.  Like the other poster said, she doesn\\'t mean to cause pain.  Pain is simply the effect (unfortunately).\\n\\nDefinitely do not speak to Andy\\'s mom anymore.  It\\'s not your problem.  It\\'s daycare mother and Andy\\'s mother\\'s problem.  The only thing you can do is correct when you\\'re around, encourage positive behavior, etc.  Keep checking in daily and ignore comments from the other woman.\\nHang in there. I went through the same thing with my son between the ages of 2-3. It is very normal - the hitting, pushing, etc. Not that all kids do it, but it is definitely a stage for many. My son is now 3 and I still watch him like a hawk when he is around other kids b/c I know how he can be with sharing, etc.\\n\\nI think it was totally wrong for the other mother to talk to you. The daycare Director should had talked to you and handled the situation. In large chain day cares, they are never allowed to say the name of the child who caused injury so that other parents do not retaliate.\\n\\nI agree that the provider can stress time out with your daughter and discipline her when she does hit. However, if that other mom talks to you again or makes you feel bad, you might want to remind her that her son will be 2 in a year and will most likely be doing the same thing to smaller children.\\n\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t think you have done anything wrong and the owner should never take an eye off the children, even when making lunch. That is not an excuse! Maybe she needs an assistant or something. How many children does she watch?\\nHello, I just want to say that in my opinion this is in NO WAY your fault! Your child is 2 years old and this is typical 2 year old behaviour. What I do have a problem with is the daycare provider - Why in the world is she leaving these two babies alone while she goes to fix lunch? They are the only 2 she watches right? Why can\\'t she bring them into the other room with her to fix lunch? She should not be leaving them alone at all. It takes only seconds for accidents to happen. And why is she telling you what the other mother said?? This is very unprofessional and will only cause friction. It is this woman\\'s job to keep them safe and WATCH them. Any blame here goes to the daycare provider and any complaints also go to her and only her. Sure she should inform the parent but not by repeating ignorant comments made by the other parent. Are you sure about this place? Is it a licensed daycare or is she a babysitter? Seems to me she can\\'t handle 2 kids - what happens if she takes on more? Maybe you can talk to her and suggest she not leave them alone? Does she have appropriate equipment like playpens? I know some people don\\'t believe in these things however they can be very helpful for a short period of time. I wish you luck here - let us know how things are going.\\nThanks so much for the replies.\\n\\nI did speak with her and she is now going to put them in their highchairs while she fixes lunch so she can keep an eye on them.\\n\\nYes, it does seem unprofessional for her to tell what the other parents are saying.  In her defense, (somewhat\\n) she tries her best to make her daycare feel like home and family.  I guess she wants us all to get along be \"family\".  It\\'s hard for the other mother not to know who hurt her child, as there are only 2 kids there.\\n\\nWhen I first started taking my DD there, she had 6 kids total.  They were all about 3 or 4 years old.  They\\'ve now moved on to preschool or kindergarten.  So my DD went from being the baby, to being the \"big kid\" about 6 months ago.  I do think that my daycare mother is used to dealing with older children.\\n\\nYes, she is licensed in our state.  Don\\'t get me wrong, I want to know about the behaviors of my DD when I\\'m not there.  But if the other mother approaches me again, I am just going to tell her that she needs to take it up with her daycare provider, not me.\\n\\nSo for now, things are okay.  My DD has talked about time out all weekend.  There is now a special stool at her daycare for her to sit in for time out.  She even puts her dolls in time out now.  We just do time out on our sofa at home.  So hopefully, things will get better.  Thanks for all comments, and I\\'m still welcoming more (from previous posters or new).  Thanks!!!!!!\\nMy daycare mother was terrific, but her 2 yr old daughter kept biting my kids (2 and 1).  My husband and I didn\\'t know what to do either.  Eventually, she grew out of it.  I wasn\\'t happy that my kids were getting bitten at daycare, but I did understand it was a stage of growth that some kids go through.  You might try role playing situations at home to help her understand her actions better, but she may not yet be developmentally ready to understand what she is doing.\\nSomething else to be aware of is your DD\\'s moods when she\\'s \"beating up\" Andy.  Is she being mean to him, or is she just playing too rough?\\n\\nMy 4 year old daughter beats the snot out of my 19 month old on a daily basis, but never out of meanness!  She just loves her baby sister so much, she gets too excited with her and, well..... we have daily middle sister induced bruises on my 19 month old as a result (I swear, it looks like she is abused!).  I talk to my 4 year old about how her baby sister is very breakable and she needs to calm down and be gentle, but the baby LOVES her sister and won\\'t stay away from her, so what can I do???  Most of her bruises are from being tackled on the tile floor, or accidentally poked with some kind of toy as big sister is flying at her for a love or a hug!\\n\\nAnyway, it\\'s just a thought I had as I was reading your original post.  For the record, the daycare mother was dead wrong for leaving the children unattended,  for telling the other mother anything about your child, and for allowing the other mother to approach you about it.  I\\'m glad things are improving at least!  Hopefully they\\'ll continue to do so???\\n',\n",

       " {'post': \"Okay here's the story.  I had a baby in December abd just quit breastfeeding a couple of weeks ago.  My firsat period was in february.  My period is irregular aas it is, but does stopping breastfeeding have any effect on you menstrual cycle.  My fist cycle was 31 days, now this one I am going on 37 days.  Since my husband and I were okayed to have sex we have used a condom every single time, and I am sure we are using it right!  How could it be possible to get pregnant if the condom is used properly. I mean the semen can't go through it, right?? Or can it?  We didn't use any oils, lubricants or anything, just the condom.  I haven't taken a test, I am stilll waiting for my period to start.  I just don't see how I could be pregnant, since we use a condom.  If anyone has any info reguarding this, I'd be much obliged, thank you!!!!\\nFirst breastfeeding will change your cycle and when you stop it could cause a delay.  Also considering you are irregular then chances are you still are.\\nYou should know condoms even when used right can fail...they leak on rare occasions.  I do suggest you talk to your doctor or take a test to ease your mind.\",\n",

       " {'post': \"I was diagnosed with osteoporosis in my hip (-3.1) and osteopenia in my spine a few months ago. I am 45 and am PREMENAPAUSAL no steroids or meds in my past to cause this. My gyno just said I had the worst number of anyone my age he's ever seen and put me on Fosomax. My spine dr. (I have scoliosis... not bad enough where I need surgery though) said I should see an endocrinologist. My regular dr. just gave me some basic blood tests and said I was fine and to continue with the Fosomax. Well, I got to thinking about what the spine dr said and I decided to see an endocrinologist. She thinks it could be hyperparathyroidism... or malabsorption of vitamin D. I just had the blood taken today (7 vials!) and my urine will be collected tomorrow. After reading all about hyperparathyroidism, it seems like it may be the reason I have osteoporosis!! In a way, I hope it is because then I can have the bad glands taken out and hopefully rebuild some bone before I hit menapause (soon, I'm sure).\\n\\nAnyway, who out there has osteoporosis due to hyperparathyroidsm? What's been your experience with this?\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\nLisa\\n\\nLisa,\\n\\nIn 1993 I was diagnosed with hperparathyroidism.  Actually my GP was the one who found it during a yearly physical.  After running a blood test for serum calcium, he sent me to an endocrinologist.  There I did a 48 hour urnine collection test and was officially diagnosed with have hyperparathyoidism.  I was placed on phosphorous treatment until they could operate, about two weeks.  The low phophorous causes muscle weakness and extreme tiredness.  I was told my phophorous was to the point that I probably would have collapsed in a week and not been able to get up.  I had a wonderful woman surgeon who performed the para********ctomy.  They found that my right lower parathryoid gland have a benign growth in it and the gland was removed.  Before I had the surgery I was not allowed to have any dairy products at all.  Believe they said there was a risk for kidney stones and gall bladder stones to form.  After the surgery I was able to and encouraged to have all the dairy I wanted.  I went through what they call Starved Bone Syndrome for a week or so, but that was normal.  My bones were taking all the calcium that was leaching out of them into my blood and bringing it back into the bone.  My major complaint during this time was that my fingers would go straight and my thumb would curl toward my palm.  That was typical of the Syndrome.  The only lasting side effects that I have from the surgery are that I do not have complete feeling in the area from my chin to the V in my collarbone.  Again this is not unusual.  There are a lot of nerves in that area and it is hard not get a few of them.  I also, about 5 years later, developed hyperthyroidism.  Again this is not uncommon.  I was told by my endocrinologist that it was because of the surgery.  The parathyroids are so small and tucked in behind the thyroid and there is bound to be some damage done.  Usually does not show up right away.  I am now on Synthroid 75 and feeling fine.\\n\\nHope this information was of help to you.  Good luck.\\nWell, it's official, I have no hyperparathyroidism or malabsorption of vitamin D... all of my blood work came back normal (I suppose that's a good thing). In any event, my endocrinologist wants me to see a specialist at Columbia Presbaterian in NYC... guess I'll be getting on the train (I live in NJ) and heading out to the city!\",\n",

If so, please reply!!!\\nI NEED SOME SUPPORT....\\nTHANKS!!!\\nKIM\\n\\nKim,\\nMy name is jarred and I have just recovered from 7 YEARS OF PAIN in my jaw and ear, I went to 40-50 doctors to have finally discovered that I had ernest syndrome. I actually came home from tennessee last night where I went to see DR. ERNEST at the ERNEST CLINIC and I had radiofrequency (rf) thermoneurolysis on my stylomandibular ligament (the main root of ernest syndrome). I suffered through many things with facial pain even went as far as had brain surgery for another condition that one of the doctors insisted that I had two years ago.\\n\\nAll in all I have been through way too much to write it all out for someone, if you are in serious need of help I am happy to talk to you so long as it may help you I am here to try and help you. I have seen it all, been through it all and am still \"recovering\" from my rf procedure with dr ernest and have a \"road to recovery\" off of some hardcore painkillers that will take a while to wean off of. I have made it my goal from here on out that if I can just maybe help one person to not have to go through what I went through then I would justify my position in life.\\n\\nIf your in any shape like I was you would be jumping at the chance to get support but its up to you if you need it that bad. I am not some freak just a guy who\\'s been through hell and wants to help someone else not suffer like me.\\n\\nSo far dr ernest saved my life and is an amazing man. I would love to help someone not have to live through what I did, hopefully (for your mind and well being) your not at your worst point like I was a week ago but if you are I hope I can help you.\\n\\nHope to help you kim,\\n\\nJarred.\\nHi Jarred,\\n\\nI have recently read about Ernest syndrome in a book by the dentist Wesley Shankland, as it is considered to be a disorder which mimics TMJ. I am curious to know how Ernest syndrome is actually diagnosed, as the book didn\\'t really explain this. Please could you explain how it was diagnosed? The book suggests that some dentists misdiagnose and treat patients for TMJ dysfunction when the actual cause is Ernest syndrome.\\n\\nI have TMJ dysfunction. Do you know how it is possible to distinguish between pain caused by TMJ dysfunction, and pain caused by Ernest syndrome, and also how common it is to actually have both conditions?\\nJarred,\\nI hope I am replying correctly to your post and that you will receive this!\\nI thank you SO MUCH for your reply to me! You have NO IDEA HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE GETTING THAT REPLY TO MY POST!!! U ARE A LIFESAVER, AND I WANT TO DO THE SAME AS U...FIND A CURE TO MY PAIN, ONCE AND FOR ALL, AND THEN MOVE ON TO HELP OTHERS IN ALL WAYS POSSIBLE!\\n\\nI would like to know what all of your symptoms were, and how Ernest syndrome was diagnosed for you. Also..have you heard of \"Eagle Syndrome\"?? This is a very similar pain condition of the stylomandibular bone/joint that needs surgery to remove excess bone that puts pressure on nerves just under the jawbone.\\nI will be awaiting your response! At this point, NOT ONE SINGLE DR OR DENTIST IN 20 YRS HAS DIAGNOSED ME with anything other than TMJ!!! (I know u went through the same crap for half your life!) How can NOT ONE SINGLE DR OR DENTIST BE AWARE OF ERNEST AND/OR EAGLE SYNDROMES, yet I found out all about it on a 10 minute internet search 3 days ago? THIS DISGUSTS ME THAT SO MUCH OF MY LIFE HAS BEEN WASTED TO CHRONIC AND DEBILITATING PAIN FOR 20 YRS!\\n\\nWhen you reply to me, if you dont mind...please list the following:\\nAll of your symptoms, what you feel caused your symptoms to begin, how {exactly} it was diagnosed for you, how it was treated, and if Dr. Ernest also knows of \"Eagle Syndrome\" and treats that, as well.\\n\\nTHANK U, WITH ALL MY HEART, FOR YOUR HELP...U ARE GODSENT!!!\\nI do believe that God puts us all here for a reason..its just too bad we have to suffer in pain half our lives to help others! (I guess this is what Jesus did, too??!!)\\n\\nYour new fan and friend,\\nKim\\n\\nJarred,\\nIf you wouldnt mind, would you mind private messaging me with your phone number so that I may call you to get more info about your experience with, and treatment of Ernest Syndrome?? I hope you are comfortable with me asking you for your number..unless you want to keep in touch on these boards. Either one is fine with me, it just may be quicker to talk instead of type...I will let you decide!\\n\\nThank you,\\nKIM\\n\\nAmanda6 / Kim,\\nFirst off I guess it would be a good idea if I Explain that I am in no way shape or form a doctor of any sort nor should you use my experiences as guarantee\\'s or answers for your treatment. Just a precaution of sorts so I don\\'t get sued, but please dont get the message mis understood, I WANT TO TRY AND HELP YOU.\\nSecondly,  if you have a pain in your leg you go into the doctors and you say \"my leg hurts\" correct? You do not go in and say \"leg\". When any dr or dentist tells you that you have \"tmj\" it is like them telling you that you have a leg. Its the name of the joint (tmj-tempromandibular joint), not the name of the condition that you \\'may\\' have. So I would advise that if you see a dr who says you have \"tmj\" that you seek a different doctor/dentist because that dr is not very knowledgable about these conditions if he/she tells you that you have \"tmj\". Its is actually named TMD (tempromandibular disorder)\\n\\nOk, on we go, I know these few things are not your questions but a bit of insight from what I\\'ve learned will shed a bit of light on the situation...first, Dr. Ernest was actually a regular ol dentist who happened to take an interest into facial pain.  He went to visit a doctor to learn a bit more about facial pain. That dr that he went to visit was actually the \"father of tmj disorder\" (drawing a blank wiith the name here). It was from there that Dr Ernest discovered Ernest Syndrome after he was well versed on the problems that TMD gave to people. Dr Ernest later discovered that there was more to the SML (stylomandibular ligament) than just a rubbery flap , it actually could get injured, and that was what was wrong with his wife who was suffering from facial pain.\\n\\nNow, finding a doctor/dentist who is well versed in this sort of thing is almost IMPOSSIBLE. Dr Ernest has actually hand trained 3 dentists! And the other dentists/dr\\'s who know anything about it are just on a whim reading an article on line like you and I - OR - reading about it in practical pain management where Dr Ernest is an editor and contributes his stories every couple of months.\\n\\nOut of the 3 dentists Dr Ernest has hand trained there is only one of them still practicing, this being because of insurance companies and what they are doing with doctors. You see they have a big problem with people who are treating this symptom because they are dentists doing .....NOT dentist things....I\\'m dead serious, insurance companies are putting treating this to a stop because they will not pay back the doctors for their time nor will they cover the procedures to help fix nor diagnose.  The dental board has actually put dentist/doctors out of practice for treating people without proper background knowledge of syndrome, doing \"unsafe\" procedures, etc, etc. Its a mess and a joke for sure!.\\n\\non to the actual questions you have...\\nIt is very hard for any doctor or dentist to diagnose Ernest Syndrome because many have no CLUE what it is!  I was actually going to see a dr in regards to getting off my painkillers, so an opiate addiction dr who by some miracle was versed in what\\'s called prolotherapy and just knew what Ernest Syndrome was! I had absolutely no hopes of being cured at the dr who discovered it! But what he did to HELP determine if I did have Ernest was do an injection into my SML which is also called a \"block\". If you feel as though you have Ernest Syndrome you need to do some thorough research on finding a doctor who treats the Ernest Syndrome (which is not many!). I know there is a Dr in new Jersey (ira klemmons) who treats Ernest Syndrome , dr ernest himself, a few other dr\\'s randomly whom I wouldn\\'t entrust a lot into but it is just me. There is really no other set way to determine Ernest syndrome unless you happen to run into a dr who happened to hear about this once before or read about it. There are no special dr\\'s who specialize in ernest syndrome, nada. A best suggestion is find the closest dr who performs prolotherapy (they say if you have suffered for under 6 months with ernest syndrome then prolotherapy may work for you, if longer than 6 months then radiofrequency thermoneurolysis would be a better option), see if they treat ernest syndrome at the dr who does prolotherapy.\\nNext suggestion is go to a facial pain clinic in your area, have them look you over for giggles and then say look I think I have this thing called ernest syndrome, can you perform the blocks that they are showing here and if not I NEED you to find me a dr who can. I have info and the actual material from dr ernest on where the sml is and how to look at things if you are a dr.  I can fax you material on it.\\n\\nIt sounds horrible to say but your absolute best bet is to see dr ernest, he is in tennesee and is the absolute best person to diagnose you.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the pain from ernest syndrome can be confused and coupled along with other issues that cause facial pain.\\n\\nMy points of pain in order from MOST SEVERE first and least closest to end...\\nLeft jaw (down towards the rounded spot at my jaw, under my actual jaw bone), left ear, pain in what felt like my teeth), left temple area, some tender feeling behind my eye, pain in left side of neck, left shoulder.\\n\\nThe full readout on what is supposed to hurt for ernest syndrome. Everyone is different, there\\'s no guarantees . What is supposed to hurt or bother you is; sml, ear, possibly tmj, temple,neck,pain behind eye, burning/tingling in throat and some hardness to swallow. These are all supposed to bother/could be all the symptoms of ernest syndrome. That doesn\\'t mean you could have less and not have ernest syndrome..\\n\\nWhat could cause or did cause me to have ernest syndrome???\\nA bad accident, a traumatic blow to the face/head, a jump off a roof, a BAD WISDOM TOOTH EXTRACTION.\\n\\nMe for example I took 3 specifically remembered shots in the jaw AND I had a horrible wisdom tooth extraction. Some people actually have no kicker, nothing that injured it or hurt it, it just hurts.\\n\\nHow to differentiate ernest syndrome pain and tmd is tough but you can somewhat tell a difference and that is by knowing the things to look for with ernest syndrome now/here and kinowing what symptoms are from tmd. The most noticable difference is that the tmj is in front of (and a tad below) your ear and should give you pain chewing/eating and all the other symptoms that are KNOWN with tmd. Where as ernest syndrome does not give you pain when you chew, its very random and even sometimes the strongest of painkiiler do not stop the pain from ernest syndrome.  Look aT all the areas of pain with ernest syndrome. If you feel like you have ernest syndrome my strongest suggestion is find the closest place to you (the few random places in usa who are not hand trained by the man, the legend, dr ernest) or dr ira klemmons or dr ernest himself.\\n\\nI STRONGLY RECOMMEND IF THERE IS ANY WAY TO GET TO TENNESSEE TO SEE DR. ERNEST-go and see him. He is the most knowledgable person on this syndrome (thanks a lot to the a$$ hole investment firms...er I mean,  insurance companies who won\\'t let some doctors so much as help a patient who is living in horrible, unidentifiable pain).\\n\\nNext, eagles syndrome from what I know is the same thing as ernest syndrome. If you have had mri\\'s, bonescans, and x-rays like myself any extra bone would probably show as not normal on any of those tests.\\n\\nOk, so here\\'s something that caught me totally off guard when I saw dr ernest but want you to know so you understand that nothing in life is guaranteed and if you are having a lot of pain you would expect it could be something in addition to possible ernest syndrome...with the pain you have it HAS TO BE something unusual right??\\n\\nI was also treated for Tempral Tendonitus (aka. Migraine mimic) which are the the two tendons that connect your actual jaw to your brain/temple \"fan\" in your head, a totally different tendon/ligament than the sml BUT could also give you similar if not the exact same pains/problems as the ernest syndrome. This is also the reason behind what dr ernest thought of my temple/eye pain and my neck/shoulder pain! I was shocked because all the dr\\'s told me I could have two things and just when I was sure I was figured out dr ernest was sold on the fact that I had temporal tendonitus based on his testing.. it all made perfect sense and since I had been through this much and was here with dr ernest the person who ALSO DISCOVERED TEMPORAL TENDONITUS ON HIS WIFE AS WELL was standing there saying I think you have both, you should be treated for both, that\\'s my take but you can decide if you would like to have me treat it...\\n\\nSo, naturally, I had him do the rf procedure on me for ernest syndrome and for temporal tendonitus. The rf procedure is simple...its a needle that has microwave heating hot capabilities that will create a lesion (a very minor small cut) on your ligament/tendon and will in turn \"nuke/kill\" it and stop the nerve endings from sending pain signals to your brain anymore! Sounds crazy and scary I know but trust me, it saved my life..I was days away from leaving my pregnant wife, 3 children, and my 75k/year job because I felt horrible for what I was doing to these poor people everyday. They have endured so much and I just felt like they were owed more than this piece of crap of a guy I turned in to. I called the Ernest clinic and talked to cynthia, dr ernest\\'s amazing, supportive wife and she explained they will get me in Monday (4 days notice) to try and help me out. I BAWLED TO HER and said I just can\\'t live like this any more, you have to try and help me or I\\'m close to ending it if you cant/won\\'t. She picked me up in spirit and my family and i went to tennessee from NY with every cent I needed to possibly heal everything.\\n\\nThe nice thing about dr ernest is that once he feels as though you have ernest syndrome he is not going to suggest you do the prolo, he will do the rf that day and it will have an 85% chance of being done! Soooooo.... worth every mile, penny, and minute.\\n\\nDr ernest treats ernest syndrome, temporal tendonitus, and another condition I am not well versed on that causes extreme headaches but stems from the back of our head which in turn needs the same treatment as the sml or temporal tendons but I had already had slashed by the brain surgery I had last year. So I probably wasn\\'t suffering from that huh?\\n\\n< edited >\\n\\nMost dr\\'s will probably be pushed into (from insurance-*if they even take insurance*) trying prolotherapy on you first. Remember they say if you have suffered for less than 6 months than prolo may help you, if not then it probably will not do it for you.. prolo is EXPENSIVE, PAINFUL, and you will not notice a difference until about 4-6 months have past.   Dr ernest will do the rf procedure the day he rules that he feels you have it. No waiting, no prolo, that\\'s it, its an 85% success rate. I can also tell you that the prolo is meant to toughen up the sml which makes penetrating the ligament for the rftn that much harder, trust me, I know and I lived I, dr ernest had some trouble completeing the procedure on me because of the prolo.\\n\\nThe procedure, dr ernest must tell you will be a little uncomfortable and that normal people will be sore but I didn\\'t feel a thing and dr ernest and his wife were the most caring, gentle, considerate people I ever had the pleasure of meeting. It was truly ann amazing experience.\\n\\nI was taking 4-30 mg oxycodones along with 4-80mg each day of oxycontin and since last Tuesday I\\'ve taken a half an oxycodone (the light stuff) maybe 4 times..? Super, dramatically less pain.\\n\\nI will wrap this up now, sorry so long to get back to you, been very busy not hurting and leading a normal life. (Sorry, don\\'t mean to rub it in, I\\'m hoping for you and plan on asking to have you put the prayer list at church that I just started attending this week; I have a lot to be thankful for now).\\n\\nI\\'ve actually spoken to dr ernest and told him I\\'ve talked to both of you and he is hopeful that he can help you and I am hoping that you can somehow manage a way to see him.\\n< edited > I can say that if you have the symptoms of ernest syndrome and have been thru the works trying to find an answer, then YOU HAVE TO SEE DR ERNEST. YOU HAVE TO MAKE A WAYY TO GO SEE HIM AND GET YOUR LIFE BACK. I\\'m crying in bed while typing this on my phone and my wife thinks I\\'m normal for crying for someone I don\\'t know, if that gives you an idea of what we have been thru and how I feel for you and hope I could help you. < edited >\\n\\nGood luck,\\nJarred\\nHi Jarred,\\n\\nThank you for your detailed reply about Ernest syndrome, I really appreciate it. It is useful and interesting to know that.\\nI definitely feel sure that I have TMJ dysfunction as I have an MRI of my TMJ showing displaced discs, and also have jaw clicking. What I am not sure about is whether they may be something else going on as well as just the displaced discs. The symptoms which I have read for TMJ dysfunction and Ernest syndrome are practically identical, so it makes it hard to tell.\\nCould you describe the symptoms of pain that you had? And the type of pain, is it sharp or a dull ache, and level of pain. Did you have pain in your ear or throat, and how would you describe that?\\n\\nBest wishes,\\nAmanda',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi All:\\n\\nI\\'m new to this board, & have a question regarding my 15 yr old daughter.\\n\\nA little background first. Our 15 yr old daughter & 11 yr old son were both adopted from Russia a little over 6 yrs ago. At the time, she was about 8 3/4 yrs old, & he was 5. They are bio sibs. Despite all the warnings we got about adopting older kids, they had virtually no emotional baggage, we bonded immediately, & they\\'ve been incredibly easy to raise, for the most part. They\\'re both very intelligent, make friends easily, & are now basically typical American kids. Our son is ADHD, but is on meds for it, & is doing very well. Our daughter has had no major medical or emotional difficulties up to this point. When we brought them home, she had not yet been to school, even in Russia, so educationally & language-wise, she\\'s basically gone from infancy to completing the 7th grade & beginning 8th grade work in just over 6 yrs, which is truly amazing to us & her teachers. She gets straight A\\'s, as well.\\n\\nOur daughter was in the public school system in our small-ish town until the beginning of 7th grade, which was this past fall. For some reason, though, all the kids who\\'d been her good friends up until that time started picking on her & bullying her terribly. She *is* a yr or 2 older than they are, & is very tall, willowy, & pretty (which I can say w/ no problem, as I\\'m not genetically responsible!\\n). She\\'s done Ballet for 6 yrs, & was persued & accepted by a prestigious modeling program this past yr. I think that what happened at school was that the other girls, trying to find their \"social position\" in middle school, decided she was an easy target, as she stood out from all the other girls. She\\'s very down to earth, not \"full of herself\", & I think it was beyond her understanding. She\\'s never understood the whole best-friend-one-day-hated-the-next-day games. She hates drama, & just wants to get along w/ everyone. At any rate, the stress of all this prompted us to take her out of the public school system, & enroll her in a new charter school, where the kids could work at their own speed, in smaller groups (the entire school has 50 students total, grades 6 -12). While our daughter has blossomed academically at this school, there are problems.\\n\\nMost of the kids at this school are there because they were kicked out of their normal school systems, due to continual behavioral problems, delinquency, or simply problems dealing w/ the structure of the public school system. Unfortunately, many of the kids fall into the first 2 groups - behavioral problems & delinquency. The school is new (this was it\\'s 1st yr), & obviously, there are always going to be growing pains w/ a new program. But discipline has been a major problem this past yr - the stories my daughter tells me when she gets home from school each day are almost frightening: girls piercing their noses, lips, & eyebrows in class (& getting away w/ it!), obscene language, smoking in the restrooms, lying, disobeying the rules in general - & quite often, the teachers don\\'t seem to do much about it. The police are called to the school at least a couple times a wk, & kids are visited & talked to by their probation officers just as often. Some kids have been taken out during the school day & taken to the local juvenile detention center. We had to file a police report on one of the kids a couple mos ago, for sending obscene text messages to our daughter. He was already on probation. The police & PO showed up at school the next day & dealt w/ him.\\n\\nThe problem is that, while my daughter says she really finds these behaviors disturbing, she\\'s also starting to display some of the behaviors of these other kids - using bad language, arguing horribly w/ us, treating her little brother terribly (physically pushing him around, making fun of him, or just ignoring him when he wants her attention, pretending like he\\'s not even in the room). She\\'s had quite a few major tantrums in the past few wks, especially.\\n\\nI used to work at the local juvenile detention center a long time ago, & have had extensive dealings w/ these kinds of kids in the past. During calmer moments at home, I\\'ve explained to our daughter that most of these kids come from broken homes, have parents who have problems, who don\\'t care for them the same that my husband & I care for her & her brother, & that they\\'re often not disciplined or even taught proper behavior at home. Our daughter is one of the few kids in the school who has a good home, parents who care about her, who try to do everything possible to help her, & who try to involve her in activities that expose her to the right kinds of kids - in her dance & modeling programs, church youth group, etc. Her lifestyle is probably completely foreign to many of the kids she sees at school. During those calmer moments when we talk about this, she seems to understand it all.....but those moments seem to be fewer & farther apart recently.\\n\\nMy question is, how else can we deal w/ this problem w/ our daughter\\'s behavior? How much is due to the influence of the kids at school, & how much is merely a symptom of being 15? When she has these outbursts at home, do we continue to try to talk to her, or just leave her alone to sort it out on her own & calm herself down? She\\'s done that more often than not, which usually involves stomping off to her room, screaming at us the entire way, falling asleep, & sometimes apologizing in the morning, & sometimes acting as if nothing happened. She told us once, the day after a nasty evening, that she didn\\'t even *remember* anything happening the night before, which strikes me as very, very odd.\\n\\nAny suggestions, experiences, idea, etc, are most welcome!!\\n\\nThanks for reading this - sorry it turned into a novel!\\n\\nkt\\noy! I would send her back to public school in a heartbeat. The things she was going through in public school is pretty common. Middle school is the hardest, esp. for girls. Girls can be very mean and cliques start to form. To me, it\\'s all about being a teenager and learning to get along. I am not entirely sure why you pulled her from the public school to begin with? Did she have any friends there?\\n\\nThe alternative school sounds more dangerous. Does she truly have friends there? I would be worried about her getting involved with the wrong crowd. It\\'s normal for a child to want to \"fit in.\" You are doing all the right things by talking to her, but peer pressure is horrible.\\n\\nCan you look into a private school or a Catholic school? She might be able to get a scholarship somewhere. Does she have friends outside of school, like at church? Where do her friends go to school?\\n\\nWith girls and hormones, most of their outbursts start earlier. Since she is 15, I do feel that the alternative school has a lot to do with her behavior.\\n\\nKeep us informed, good luck!\\nChildren just dont seem to understand how very temporary their school years are and how none of this is the end of the world! Very few grasp that the real reason for school is their education and not all the social. And with a daughter who is so pretty, she will either be loved or hated. Very very sad. I agree with the above poster. I think I would put her back in public school. Also, I would start demanding better behavior, and a little more politeness. For instance, keep good grades, and mind your p\\'s and q\\'s....and you can continue modeling. If you dont, no moddeling. You want to argue about that....your grounded. Anything else to say? And I will start taking away the things in your room.  She sounds like a good kid, and this is a difficult age. She is trying to assert herself. Just let her know that it\\'s ok to assert yourself, but 1.) there are much more respectful ways of doing it, and 2.) Your still her mother, and in the end, what you say goes.\\n\\nMy husband & I talked to the school\\'s director, meeting after school in her office. She was very interested in what we had to say/ask. The kids had to turn in their forms today, letting them know whether they\\'d be enrolling next school yr or not. We stated that we wanted to find out about any changes in the program for next yr, as this was it\\'s first yr, & I was sure they\\'d learned a lot about what was & wasn\\'t working in different areas.\\n\\nAs it happens, *her* major concern was also the behavior of the students, & what they were planning on doing to change their policies for the upcoming yr to address this. While she was mostly aware of what sorts of things were going on w/ some of the students, she was shocked to hear about kids trying to pierce themselves in class. She hadn\\'t heard anything about it - no teachers mentioned it, no other parents, etc. She later called me at home & said she asked her own 16 yr old daughter if they do that at the rural school she attends, & she said that yes, kids there do that, too. It was quite a wake-up call for her, proving that no matter how small the school or how attentive the teachers & staff are (this school even has video cameras in all the classrooms & halls), some things are going to be missed.\\n\\nThey intend, next yr, to further divide the kids into smaller groups than they had them in this past yr. The way they\\'ve had it was that the 6 - 8th grades were in the same very large classroom, doing their individual work on their own computers; same w/ the 9 - 12th grade kids. They ended up, part way through the yr, dividing up the 9 - 12th graders in to 2 groups - the ones who were there to learn, & the ones who had behavioral problems. She said it worked out pretty well. They didn\\'t think they *had* to do this w/ the 6-8th graders, but they realize now that they do, & that is their intention for next yr.\\n\\nIf we thought we could do it w/out making her totally miserable & more angry at us, we\\'d put our daughter back into the public middle school.....but she\\'s adamant that she wants to continue at her new school, cos, as she said, she\\'s more interested in catching up academically than she is about making friends w/ these kids. The school\\'s director agreed that that was what our daughter was doing in school, from everything she\\'s seen - if another kid talks to her politely, she\\'ll be polite back to them, & when the conversation\\'s over, it\\'s over. If a kid starts talking to her rudely, she just turns away from them. The school\\'s director said that, if anything, our daughter needs to be *more* forceful in her remarks to some of these kids - she\\'s so quiet that the kids consider it a challenge to see if they can upset her. And, since she doesn\\'t want to show she\\'s upset in the presence of these mean kids, she\\'s perhaps holding it in, & blowing all that steam off here at home. Kinda makes sense to me, in a way. Maybe if the mouse decides to roar once at school, it\\'ll get that tension out of her system, so she\\'s not dragging it home w/ her. I guess it\\'s worth a shot.\\n\\nOddly enough, despite all this, the kids had their field day today, & as they were sitting in the park having their picnic lunch, they started talking about each other, & how they would categorize everyone in their class. Surprisingly, the other kids decided that our daughter was the Most Polite, Prettiest, & Hardest Worker, in the 6 - 8th grade group. That really gave her a boost - perhaps these kids really *do* see her values, despite their nasty behavior most of the time. So she was in a really upbeat, happy mood when she came home from school, & it seemed to carry over into the entire evening at home. No frustrations, no arguments, no over-dramatic behavior, nothing! Since they were at the park most of the day, it sounds like the kids were kept busy doing fun stuff, & the rotten behavior was kept to a minimum....& as a result, so was our daughter\\'s stress level.\\n\\nSo, I think we\\'re going to keep her at this school. She says she intends to work on the computer several hrs a wk here at home, logging into the school\\'s computer system, & continuing her lessons so she can catch up even faster.\\n\\nThanks for the suggestions. I\\'ll definitely keep those various options in the back of my head as this all continues to unfold. I\\'ll try to work w/ her on how to be more assertive w/ the kids at school when they try to involve her in their questionable stuff, see how the new system works during the upcoming school yr, & take it from there. I just hope we have a nice, peaceful summer in the meantime!\\n\\nkt\\nI would try as hard as possible to get her involved in something at school, which is hard in an alternative school. At least the public school has sports and theater (most likely). Does her current school have any extra curricular activities?\\nIt seems if she could find an activity that interests her at school, then she would make friends with kids who have the same interest as her. Sometimes kids have to find that group that works for them.\\n\\nGood luck!\\nwell it seems that you\\'ve put her in that environment....with kids with bad behavior, etc, and it\\'s rubbing off!\\nput her back in her regular high school, pronto!\\nand if she has problems with kids, she deals with it.....\\nthat\\'s life, you can\\'t teach her that when there\\'s a problem with someone, you will wisk her away to somewhere else so she doesn\\'t have to deal with it.\\n\\nSure, the theory makes sense. What doesn\\'t is how this woman knows it\\'s going on....so do the teachers I\\'m sure....and nobody is doing anything to stop it! I\\'d be angry and crabby too.\\n\\nI just went through a situation at my childs elementary school. One thing that I learned while going through it is that I am sure there are a  handful of good teachers out there. The kind who are really and truely there to teach, and help your child be the best they can be. Putting that special group aside.....the rest got into it for the paid hollidays and summer vacations. They are human like everyone else and not above glossing over the truth to get out of dealing effectively and efficiently with problems, or even outright lying to cover their own behinds! It\\'s up to YOU to look out for the best interest of your child because at the end of the day,she\\'s yours! You know her best. And you have to be dilligent and on it. and unless you are willing to admit that your child is reckless, abusive, and has a learning disorder of some sort, then I really dont think that alternative education is the right place for her.\\n\\nFor some reason half of my response ended up as part of the quote. I have a hard time with the quoting, ending the quote, and picking it back up again. lol. sorry.\\n\\nThis right here is what would most concern me, and there\\'s no way around it.  No matter what changes are made at the school, that\\'s still a fact.\\n\\n15 is an age where some kids are extremely susceptible to bad influences.  When the bad influences are all around you, it\\'s hard to not have some \"rub off\" so to speak.  Granted, there are always a few who will excel no matter how bad the environment (think of rare stories of inner-city youths with crackhead parents going to harvard), and some who will tank no matter how good the environment (rich, privileged kids getting hooked on coke and pills).\\n\\nBut for all the kids that fall somewhere in the middle, I firmly believe that your environment and those around you will have a large influence.  For that reason, your daughter\\'s school situation would scare me like crazy.\\nWell, she did it again tonight. My husband asked both kids to get the ferrets out, play w/ them, & clean their cages. Our son said ok, & went in to get started. Our daughter was on the computer, & she kept saying, \"I\\'ll go in in a min.\" My husband called my son back into the room, muted the tv, & asked them to both come over & sit down, cos he wanted to tell them something. Our son came back in & sat down. Our daughter kept looking at the computer, & when my husband said, \"come over & sit down *please*\", she finally huffed & puffed & came over, sat facing the opposite direction so she didn\\'t have to look at her dad, & when he asked her to please face him, she spun around dramatically & just looked at the ceiling. All he wanted to say to them was that, on the days he had to work late (like tonight), he\\'d appreciate it if they started on the cages while he was on his way home, which would give them plenty of time to do homework, watch a little tv &/or chill out for awhile, whatever, & that he\\'d do it on the nights where he was home early, or didn\\'t work the next day. My husband said that they\\'d have a lot of responsibilities over the next few mos, as I\\'m having knee replacement surgery in July, & they\\'d have to help out a lot while I\\'m recovering. Our son thought that was a good idea, but our daughter didn\\'t answer at all when asked. She just got up & went into the room where the ferrets are kept, mumbled something & started to close the door. My husband turned to her & said \"what did you say?\", & she started in w/ her \"oh my ****, you\\'re going to start yelling at me *again*!\" My husband said that he simply wanted the courtesy of an answer from her, & would she please answer him. She said, \"yes, fine.....I understand, do you think I\\'m stupid or something?\"\\n\\nMy husband made her come back in & sit down while our son started his share of their chore. He told her that nobody said anything about her being stupid, nobody was yelling at her, & that all he wanted was a simple yes or no when he asked a question. She said, \"I already said yes, so leave me alone\", & started to leave the room.  He & I just looked at each other, & I said, \"ok, I\\'m about ready to stick my foot in my mouth & say something that\\'ll probably end up getting in trouble for\". He asked what it was, & I told him that I was about ready to tell her that if she kept up the arguing, disrespect, & everything else, we would put her back into the public middle school next yr, cos we\\'re afraid the behavior of the kids at her present school is rubbing off on her. My husband thought about it for a sec, then said, \"ok, let\\'s call her in, tell her that, & deal w/ the tantrum that\\'ll happen once we tell her.\" So we called her back in once again, made her sit down, & we told her - the tantrums, drama, screaming, threatening us, accusing us of hating her, etc, will stop immediately, & that she was going back to the public school if she didn\\'t.\\n\\nSure enough, the tantrum started. \"You can\\'t do that to me, I\\'ll go to school wherever I want.\"  \"No you can\\'t - you\\'ll go where WE say you\\'ll go.\"  \"You can\\'t make me.\"  \"Yes we can - we\\'re your parents & that\\'s exactly what our job is. *Your* job is to listen, obey, & behave, & if you don\\'t start doing just that, that\\'s exactly what we\\'re going to do, like it or not.\" She started to get up to leave, & my husband pushed her back down into the chair (just put his hands on top of her shoulders & pushed her back down), ^ she started screaming at the top of her lungs, \"you hate me! I can feel your hate! You don\\'t care about me at all!\" I told her that if we *didn\\'t* care, if we *didn\\'t* love her, we wouldn\\'t be having this conversation, & we wouldn\\'t give a damn *what* she did or where she went. She started to get up again, my husband pushed her back down into the chair the same was as before, & she started screaming, \"you\\'re choking me, you\\'re smothering me, I can\\'t breathe, stop hurting me!\" We weren\\'t even TOUCHING her at that point, & I said, \"you can breathe just fine, nobody\\'s got heir hands over your face except YOU!\" Then she started crying hysterically & hyperventilating. My husband got a paper lunch bag & said that if she was going to do that, she\\'d better start breathing into the bag to calm herself down. (Our son has asthma, & when he has an attack, he tends to panic, so we have him breathe into a bag to calm himself & his breathing down.) She threw the bag on the floor, & as my husband picked it back up, I told her that her behavior has gotten a lot worse since she started at that school, & we didn\\'t want her to end up like them, since she says she doesn\\'t like them & the way they act. Do you *want* to start acting like them? Do you *want* to throw away all the hard work you did this yr w/ your grades? You have the best grades in the school (which is true - she\\'s the only student on the \"all A\\'s\" list at the end of each semester), you worked your tail off for that.....do you really want to throw it all away simply cos you won\\'t answer us when we ask you a simple question? You\\'re a much better person than that, when you want to be. But if you don\\'t start getting yourself under a little better control, we\\'re going to start taking things away until you earn them back - & the first item we\\'ll take away is your new school. So you better start thinking that over. My husband went in to help our son w/ the ferrets, & I told him I\\'d stay right where I was, & so would our daughter, as I wasn\\'t going to let her just go to her room, turn on the stereo, & fall asleep w/out thinking about all this.\\n\\nShe sat in the chair & just became completely silent - no crying, no yelling, no hyperventilating, no nothing. Just sat w/ her hands over her face, not moving or making a sound at all. So, we just let her sit there, & we all went back to what we were doing before all this started. I was watching American Idol (I\\'m not a regular fan, but Crystal Bowersox is a hometown girl, & I wanted to see the outcome). Soon, our daughter slid down onto the floor, grabbed a blanket, covered herself up & started watching, too.\\n\\nOnce the show was over, & my husband & I were going to go upstairs so he could get some sleep & I could look at the computer for a few min before going to bed myself. My husband said good night to our daughter, & she stood up, came over to him (blanket over her head for effect), & started to give him a hug. He said, no, take the blanket off your head first. She did, He said good night, I love you, & she said I love you too. She then came over & did the same w/ me. I told her she could stay up til midnight (she\\'s done w/ school for the yr - she got to get out a few days early, cos she finished her 7th grade work last mo, & has already started her 8th grade work, ahead of the rest of her class).\\n\\nSo hopefully, she now knows that the lines are drawn in the sand. If she doesn\\'t hold up her part of all this, she\\'ll start losing things, starting w/ the new school. I\\'m going to try to talk calmly to her about this tomorrow during the day, not making any accusations, nice & calm, to make sure she understands that we\\'re *serious* about all this, & find out how she plans to hold up her end of things. I have to take her shopping to get stuff she needs for summer camp, anyway, so maybe I\\'ll have the discussion w/ her while we\\'re doing that. She wouldn\\'t dare have a tantrum in public, I know - she wouldn\\'t embarrass herself that way. We\\'ll see what happens.\\n\\nBTW, as for the school she\\'s now going to - even though it\\'s an \"alternative\" type school, all the work they do is approved by the state board of education, & it\\'s actually an extention of the North Central Ohio Educational Service Center.\\n\\n<sigh> I just hope we made some sort of impression on her tonight. She can be such a good kid most of the time, but all this recent stuff is just dragging her down.\\n\\nkt\\nHonestly, from your latest post, she sounds like a fairly typical 15 year old.  Looking back on my teen years (I\\'m 31 now), I had a few similar episodes with my parents.  It is a tough, tough age.  As long as that\\'s the extent of it, and she cools off and realizes that her behavior was wrong and unwarranted, I think you\\'ll get through this and be oK.\\n\\nI still say, though, that I would be worried about her current school.  I\\'m not sure the tantrums are a result of her associations at school, but I\\'d be worried about what may come as she continues there.  Just be vigilant and keep a very, very close eye on who she\\'s hanging with, to make sure she\\'s not getting into the \"wrong\" crowd, since it sounds like there\\'s a big \"wrong\" crowd to suck her in.\\nI dont understand why the arguments are allowed to escalate like that. I think the first moment she became disrespectful, It would be off to her room(where hopefully there isn\\'t a tv, phone, or anything else fun for her) until she can talk in a civilized manner. If she wants to act like a 5 year old, punish her like one. Along with that, if she feels like everyone hates her, or is out to get her, that\\'s ok. She has a right to her feelings. She even has a right to voice them. She does not have the right to scream, yell, or be rude and insulting. Everyone is there to talk, if she wants to talk. But I would not allow her to continue flying off the handle at everyone. Remove her from the scenario the second she starts and let her know you wont talk til she is ready.\\n\\nSecond, your son is a bit younger. Stop including him in on the talks with her. It\\'s unnecessary stress on him, and of course he is going to listen a little better. It sounds to me like he\\'s still at the age where he really wants to please mom and dad. So, if you have something to say and she starts, excuse her from the situation and deal directly with your son, then deal with her afterwards. Or vice versa. But dont lump them together, I guarantee you he feels the tension of the situation, even if nobody is upset with him.\\nOur son went to a friend\\'s house this afternoon, & ended up spending the night, so it was just my husband, myself, & our daughter at home. She had a dance recital rehearsal to go to, but once she was home, we had a talk while cleaning cages.\\n\\nShe says she doesn\\'t know *why* she had the outbursts she had. We asked her to try to tell us what she was feeling when she acted that way, & she said that she felt mad at herself. The only reason she could think of that made her feel that way was cos, when she wants to say something to us, she can\\'t always find the right words right away, & she gets frustrated & mad at herself. (I can kinda understand that - she\\'s 15, & she\\'s only spoken English for 6 yrs, after all....she *does* sometime have to slow down to think of the right word, or the right way of saying something, when she\\'s having a regular, calm conversations w/ us. And even when she gets something right, she sometimes still uses Russian word order a little bit.) We asked her if, when that happens, if it would help if we back off a little & give her a few min to think of how she wants to say something, & she said she didn\\'t know, but maybe that would help. She also said that sometimes, she\\'s afraid to ask us something, cos she\\'s afraid that she won\\'t word it right, & maybe it\\'ll sound like she\\'s asking something completely different, & we\\'ll get mad at her. We asked her if we\\'ve ever done anything worse than say \"no\" when she\\'s asked us anything, & she admitted that, no, we\\'ve never gotten mad at her for asking a question.\\n\\nSo maybe, part of the problem is that we *all* have to slow down a little in our conversations, debates, etc. The next problem is *remembering* to do so.\\n\\nShe doesn\\'t want to be like the other kids at her school. She doesn\\'t associate w/ them, really - if one of them speaks politely to her, she\\'ll respond politely, too, & once the conversation is over, she goes back to her work. If someone acts mean to her, she just says \"whatever\" & tries to ignore them. But she did say that sometimes, having to listen to their behavior, bad language, etc all day at school, made her mad. I asked her if it made her mad at *us*, & she said no, but when she\\'d start to tell us about it, it made her feel the same way she felt at school, while the actual event was happening.\\n\\nWe also broached the subject of her staying at that school or not. We asked her if she understood the reasons the school bothers us a little, & she said that she did understand - some of the kids are not good kids, & we don\\'t want her to start acting like them. But she told us that, since she\\'s trying not to associate w/ those kids (other than polite conversation at school), she really wants to stay there, cos her grades have skyrocketed since she started there, working at her own pace, & she wants to keep her good grades up, & maybe catch up to her age group a little more closely. She wants to continue doing lessons via the computer over the summer, so she can catch up even faster. We told her again how proud we are of her school work this yr, cos we knew she was smart enough to get decent grades....but we still have some reservations about the other kids at school, & asked her if she understood why it was such a touchy topic. She said she did understand, but she said that she just didn\\'t care about the other kids, & just wanted to be able to concentrate on her school work, in the way that she discovered is the best way for her to do it & understand it all.\\n\\nSo, we ended up drawing up a contract w/ her, which she thought was a great idea. The deal is, IF she completes the chores she\\'s supposed to do during the summer, IF she does it w/out arguing, & IF she works on maintaining her temper when we discuss things w/ her, we will allow her to stay at her present school. If she doesn\\'t follow the contract, she will start losing things, including her cell phone, & her voice in the decision making process concerning school. In return, we have to give her a chance to stop & formulate what she wants to say to us when we talk, so she can express herself clearly w/out getting frustrated & mad at herself or at us. She thought this was very fair, & we all signed it. We will pull it out & evaluate our ability to stick to the contract, or make any changes we feel need to be made, as we go along, since situations change, & she won\\'t actually be in school w/ these kids for the next few mos, which hopefully will have a calming effect on her behavior.\\n\\nThe ideal situation would be if there were some way she could do her school work the way she is now, which is working so well for her, but be able to do it in a public school situation. But, as of now, nothing like that exists. She\\'s still adamant that she does NOT want to go back to the public middle school, where she was bullied so badly that she couldn\\'t concentrate on her work, & was required to work at the speed everyone else in class did, which wasn\\'t working for her. She also realizes that, at some point in the future, she may change her mind & want to try it again. We said we\\'d cross that bridge if we came to it, & she was fine w/ that.\\n\\nHer behavior today was excellent. She did the things she was asked to do, did some extra stuff to keep busy (her brother\\'s still in school until Tues), & even asked us to all sit down together & play a game after everything was done & before it got too late in the evening. So we did, & we all had a great time together.\\n\\nWe\\'ll see what happens.\\nI think that sounds very productive and positive! I do not have teenagers.....my oldest is 8. But I go through problems with \"effective communication\" with them two. Like your daughter....my oldest has only spoken english for about 6 years! lol. Sometimes I forget the limits and it can be frustrating......very frustrating. But I think knowing that this is part of the problem is a great start at going about fixing it. And dont worry too badly if you dont remember and fail, it takes a lot of intiative and dilligence to make new habbits and keeping them. If you get it wrong........that\\'s what appologies are for. At least we can be big enough to admit when we make a mistake......and if your anything like me and hate having to appologize and admit you were wrong, I imagine you will only have to do it once or twice before it begins to kick in.\\n\\nAs for her schooling.....there are some WONDERFUL home schooling programs out there. I dont know if that is something that you may be interested in...you may want to check into it. You can work a little more at your own pace because it takes a lot of the mumble jumble out of the day. there arent 30 other kids in her class so that alone cuts down on the time necessary, and there arent things like gym that also take up time. On the down side, there arent any extra curricular activities either like band or sports....but if you have a YMCA or a rec department in your area, you can still get her involved. I dont think I would worry about the lack of social since it seems like she isn\\'t really persuing it to begin with. And with some of the programs, for instance calvert, you can even have access to teachers 24/7 that can help if you hit a sticky spot. They send tests and you mail in your work, then you get an actual grade and school transcripts that become available for applying to colleges and what have you. Anyway, it\\'s just food for thought. Good luck!\\nMelissa\\nSounds like a combination of being 15 and the school environment.  Perhaps you should explore home schooling.  Many public schools have such programs and assist you all the way in teaching your children at home.  There are also private home schooling groups that assist and offer extra curricular activities which provide thae students with social interaction.  We home schooled our son from 7th grade on and my Sister home schooled all 7 of her children from kindergarten through high school.\\nThey are all well adjusted and fairly successful.',\n",

Frankly I think it has more to do with the cold I seem to be fending off, but I must say I found it odd to see this thread and realize that I\\'ve got one!\\n\\nWho knows, but from what I hear, I need to take more vitamin C in order to deal with it.\\n\\nStill find it odd though!\\nHi all -\\n\\nI just stopped taking lupron and estrogen, and just about every part of my body has been affected.

Any tips on what sizes or types of bras to expect to buy?\\nDid breastfeeding affect your breasts' firmness or shape? Was it related to the amount of time you breastfed?\\nWhat does your doctor tell you about it?\\nThis came from drlove.com:\\n\\nLove Quiz question for Friday, 06/22/2001\\nQuestion: Breast feeding causes changes in the appearance of the breast. T or F.\\n\\nAnswer: False. Changes in breast tissue, such as droopiness or stretch marks, are related to the changes that the body undergoes during pregnancy and not to breast feeding.\\n\\nI just came across it last week.  My husband doesn't want me to breastfeed our next baby because he fears that my breasts will change more.\\n\\nFirm perky breasts only come on young women who haven't had children, but over time your breasts change anyways even if you don't have kids.  I breast fead for 5 months, and my breasts don't really seem any different that they did when I was 5 months pregnant.  I think I lost the perkyness during pregnancy.  BUT during breastfeeding your breasts will fill up and become larger, then after a feeding with your new little baby your breasts are rather floppy and saggy (they are empty).  Then in a couple of hours they are full again.  I believe mine were just a bit on the saggy side for the first month or so after stopping breast feeding.  But now it's been 7 years and I've just got womens breasts.  After you're all done having kids, get implants or a breast lift if your not happy.\\n\\nAlso exercise will help, remember you do have pec's under those breasts.\\n\\nAs far as bra's, go buy maternity bra's.  Read the packgage and that will help you find the right size.  You should get them now as during your pregnancy your breasts will get larger and your rib cage will expand, and the correct support is going to help you in your comfort and keep your breasts from hanging and stretching.  Maternity bra's have adjustments for this.  And as your body goes back to normal and you are breastfeeding your maternity bra's will also be adjustable for the best fit, and flaps for quick and easy access.\\n<p>[This message has been edited by Shaelle (edited 09-15-2001).]\",\n",

Any help would be much appericated. Thanks.\\nHi Kim,\\nYes, it is a life-long thing.\\nNo, except in rare cases, the med has no adverse side-effects.  It is replacement of thyroid you would have normally produced.\\nWhen you get up to your best level, you will get well.\\n\\nI dislike drugs and pills, myself, but this one I welcome!  Just research hyperthyroid symptoms, so you can tell your doctor if you think you have gotten too much med.\\nIt is not serious, and you have plenty of time to report it, as most doctors undertreat hypothyroidism.  My doc always over treats and then backs down, so you see it is nothing to worry over.\\nI too have started on Synthroid. I also was wondering about the reactions to it. I have read some awful stuff. But now I know that it should help me. Thanks to Tree Frog. Tree Frog, you have answered my questions.\\nIn case your MD didn't tell you you need to take your thyroid hormone at the same time every day and take it with a small amount of water at least 2 hours before and at least 1 hour after eating anything or you will NOT get adaquate absorption of the med.especially avoid oats and soy products in the meal following your meds. There are some long term effects of thyroid hormones BUT they are nothing compared to not taking them  or taking too little or too much. It will take a while to get your levels right. But, once you really feel GOOD then you ought to have your levels checked one more time and keep that info in your files. Tho your need may change with time, to have a level of when you really felt  right will be to your benefit later on. You probably will need to see an endocrinologist at some point. GPs are not all that clever when it comes to dose adjustments etc.\\nAlso, calcium and iorn can cause absorbtion problems.  Vitimans should be taken at least 2 hours after your synthroid.  An internest(a Dr spec in internal medicine) can be just as effective as an endo.  Depending on your GP/FP Dr experiance with thyroid problems you may want to seek someone else with the expertise.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Sorry, this is kinda wordy...\\n\\nI have always had \"girly\" issues. For several years now I notice that just before and during my menstrual cycle I feel flu like. Sometimes actually vomiting. This past year it has gotten more serious. Several times now my PMS symptoms never go away. I will get bloated, have a great deal of breast swelling and tenderness (my breasts swell so much I actually have a different bra size for \"that time of the month\")and suffer from that strange flu like feeling. I will have my period but the symptoms do not go away. When my next period comes around the symptoms increase to the point I get dizzy (this last period I fainted three different times) sometimes I stay dizzy all day. I get nauseous even vomiting. My breasts get so swollen and sore that when I role over in my sleep the pain wakes me up. Occasionally (too often in my point of view) the constant breast tenderness/pain is accompanied by a periodic stabbing sensation through the nipple. (what I imagine a needle would feel like being poked through my nipple) I even have a feeling of fluttering in my chest. I get shaky, confused, have migraine quality headaches (per my doc based on the description of the headaches) and feel very worn out. I went to see the doc and all my blood work came back fine.(he did not check hormone levels) They even did a CT because I had a TIA (micro stroke) last fall and they wanted to be sure I had not had a stroke. That also turned out fine. My blood sugar was 114, I hadn\\'t eaten all day because the dizziness was so severe I was vomiting (actually I was dry heaving), however, I did manage to stay hydrated. I had just eaten a couple of cheese/peanut butter crackers from the vending machine that the nurse brought me. My doc was convinced I was anemic due to my symptoms and because my face and lips were almost an even shade of white. However, I was not. When the dizziness is at it\\'s peak I get a tingly sensation in my hands, feet, and or face. My periods are very light and short in duration, although it ended on the 13th, I am still having a great deal of symptoms. I do not typically have mood issues with my PMS and have no complaints now in that area. I am in a point in my life where I am very content. I do not feel stress is an issue. I am a pretty busy person and like to stay on the go and this is truly hindering my quality of life. I have a GYN appt. on the 25th. Any ideas on what could be going on and any tips on questions to ask during my appt.?I am starting to get scared and I really need to feel better soon. Can anyone help?\\n\\nThanks\\nHi there -\\n\\nSorry you have been through such a miserable time.\\n\\nWhen you fainted, did you go to the ER?  Fainting always means something is wrong - people don\\'t just faint.  If it happens again, go.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I would ask for every single blood test known to man (or woman).  Ask for thryroid, even if its been done before as it sometimes takes several tests to show anything, hormone levels, a pregnancy test for sure even if you have had periods, CBC, liver, anything.  You have so many different symptoms, but the bloating and breast pain sound hormonal.  Make sure they test ALL levels, not just estrogen.  I don\\'t know all the specific tests, but I am sure someone else here does.\\n\\nGood luck, and I hope you feel better.\\n\\n\\nOther hormone tests besides estrogen are testosterone, DHEA (and there are different forms of that one) and estradiol, you may also want to get a cortisol test. Thyroid tests you need other than TSH would be T4 free, T3 free and thyroid antibodies.  Have you ever had a glucose tolerance test done?   If your blood sugar was 114 it was probably reflecting the cheese PB crackers you had just eaten, but you still may want to have your blood sugar checked out.  I think a lot of it is hormonal, although it doesn\\'t sound like it is all hormonal so you need to get some testing done.\\nGood luck.\\nThank you for your responses. I did go to the ER (the third time I fainted) which is where the tests I stated were done. That is who referred me to the GYN. They also ran a PG test (although my boyfriend was \"fixed\" a couple of years ago) and it was negative. My thyroid was tested about two years ago and it came back fine. Since then I have had increasing symptoms to this climactic point where I am fainting or \"blacking out\". (sometimes I just experience a vision black-out, spots, and a far away feeling/tunnel effect.)I feel reassured that the initial blood work came back fine as well as the CT so I am not as scared as I have been but it makes the burden no easier to bare for me or my family.\\n\\nThanks Again!',\n",

I also had: morning backache that went a way during the day, rapid heart beat when resting (90-100/min), some heart palpitations, dry skin and thick dry skin on parts of my feet. These symptoms got progressively worse but my doctors said it was impossible to have symptoms of both at the same time.  But they were wrong! It turned out that my adrenal glands were slowly failing and my blood cortisol was occasionally low (especially during times of high stress). Low blood cortisol can cause symptoms of both high and low thyroid, even if you are taking a proper synthroid dose. Perhaps you should have a 24-hour urine cortisol test.  After I started medication for my adrenal glands, all my symptoms cleared up.  You can also check out \"adrenal insufficiency\" and \"Addison\\'s disease\" for more information on the WEB.',\n",

I had become more and more forgetful, but since I started meds, my memory has gotten better.  I attributed my symptons to being a mom.  I didn\\'t really consider the weight gain because I had stopped exercising.  They discovered my enlarged thyroid on a rountine visit.  They did blood work, but they thought there was an error made at the lab.  I had more blood work and an ultrasound.  The lab results came back the same and the ultrasound confirmed the condition.

That is the usual starting dose, and the doc will see how quickly you respond from there.  It will tell him if you need more than that dose on a regular basis.\\nThere is no hurrying up this process.\\n\\nBeing anxious actually exacerbates the symptoms, because it creates a chemical imbalance which requires more thyroid!\\nThen we feel more anxious!

Now, 5 years later, I am finally \"normal\" with a tsh of 5 and I am on the highest level of Synthroid that is made which is .3. I was taking .450 for a while. It appears that I will be at the level for the rest of my life. I have not been able to lose the weight gained, but I do feel a bit better. I do not think that I will every feel as great as I did pre-1995. I do not know why. The Dr. has tried all kids of drugs, of which I refuse to take anymore, with the exception of the Synthroid. I have tried herbs, spices, holistic treatment, massage, basically you name it. But life goes on.\\nJunebug-  I have 2 little ones and I understand the tiredness.  Besides vitamins try to eat right-stay away from sweets (as much as you can) have a strawberry or a sweet mellon instead. I do really well on a reduced red meat diet with more pasta and fish.  Walking seems to re-energize me.  An indoor mall is great for bad weather and the kids love to get out of the house.  Try to make time for yourself-hire a baby sitter and go to a movie or out to eat.  It will take time to get your levels in check but you\\'ll be there sooner than you think.\\nstevelutz, how did you feel at a level of 317?  Do you know how long you could have had the problem?  How do you feel now?  Can you really feel a difference?  Are there any other medical problems that you have been faced with?  Did most of your symptoms go away once your TSH became normal?  Sorry for being so questioning, but you are the first person I have talked to with levels as high as mine.  Sometimes, I feel like a walking zombie.  Thank you for your insight. Junebug\\nGee Junebug!\\nI BET you DO feel like  a zombie! I felt like the walking dead at TSH 5.6!!\\n\\nI did press on, too. But I agree with the advice to look out for your own needs as well as the kids\\'. The stress of inadequate rest makes the symptoms worse.\\n\\nSelenium, B, C, A & D, E are all needed to assimilate the thyroid med. My doc said in our area we don\\'t need to supplement selenium, but I reminded him we get foods from who knows where. He told me to take 200 mg of selenium daily.\\n\\nI take all these on an empty stomach with my med, with water only, first thing in the morning. An hour later I can eat what I choose.\\n\\nTake any other hormones or meds 12 hours later. Many foods (cabbage family foods, for example)and supplements can bind and render thyroid med useless, is the reason to take them apart from each other.\\nExample: calcium binds up thyroid med and is in many juices and foods, so you see the reason to do this.\\nWhen I was diagnosed the doctor never told me anything about when I should take the medcine, what vitamins, or anything.  I have done most of my own research through the internet.  I know, switch doctors.  That is not as easy for me as I wish.  I have to go to an Army hospital, so I am happy just to get an appointment.  So my question now is, do you take all of those vitamins with your meds and what is selimum (spelling)?  Thanks again.  Oh, I didn\\'t know about the calcium thing, I had been taking my meds with OJ, now I\\'ll switch to water.\\nJunebug',\n",

The doctor diagnosed me with the 38 day cycles, infertility, and high testosterone (before he even saw my ovaries).  He said you only need three to be diagnosed.  I would ask your RE if you are experiencing any of these.  They can put you on glucophage (metformin generic) to help quality of eggs and ovulation.  Good luck this cycle\\n\\nSome of the most common symptoms are:\\nfacial or body hair,skin tags,weightgain or loss or in my case can\\'t do either,brown patches on nape of neck,no periods,infertility, and along with the above symptoms mentioned in replies. Good Luck.\\nThanks a lot for the information. It was of great help.\\n\\n\\nI too suffer from PCOS..... It was detected with the vaginal ultrasound which the Doctor pointed out to me along with the Bloodwork.....I had surgery in August and it was determined that I had severe endometriosis and polycystic ovaries...(Although they cannot remove the PCOS, they can help you to achieve pregnancy through medications.....such as Glucophage....)\\n\\nHope all works out for you!\\nMy Dr. sent me to an endocrinolgist and see did u/s and bloodwork see said that due to the infertility and the fact that my cycles were very irregular and that my testosterone levels were high that  she thought that I may have PCOS.  But I changed Dr\\'s and when they did the HSG he detected a small growth in my uterus and said that I needed to have a D&C done and he said while he had me under he would like to do exploritory lapriscopic and hystoscopy so I agreed.  The surgery went well only a polyp the size of a pea.  And he said the my uterus, tubes and ovaries all looked great and that he couldn\\'t see anything wrong, thus he said that I had unexplained infertility.  Wouldn\\'t he have been able to see PCOS on my overies during the surgery?\\nKelly',\n",

       " {'post': \"I had total blood test on 12/27/00:  I originally went in because my stomach had been burning for about 9 days and I had off and on diareahha.  No blood, or anything unusual. All blood count (red, white, hemo, globin, albumin, came back normal.  But, my indirect bilirubin was 2.4, with direct at .3,total 2.7. ALT was 71, AST 32.  Alkaline phosphatase a tad high at 141.  I went back a week later and my Dr. repeated the liver portion. ALT, AST, and Alk. Phosp, stayed the same, but I had a 3.3 indirect bilirubin.  Direct still at .3.  I have no pain anywhere in my abdomen.  I've been taking Zantac because I still have somewhat burning stomach, but nor quadrant pain on either side.  Have a great appetite and haven't had any diarehha.  Over the last couple of days, I notice when I pull my bottom eye lids down, I can see a little yellow.  And, probably the last 6-7 days my eyes have been burning a little and a little red.  But not really jaundice except under the bottom eye lid.  I've also had dark urine in the morning, more than normal.  If it's my indirect bilirubin that is high, why is my urine darker?  What do you think this could be?  No pains...\\nMy liver functions are so outta whack all the time that I know for sure that you can have very dark urine with an elavated billi... my urine is frequently the color of iced tea... the yellowing under the eyelid could be a product of very mild jauntice..\\n\\nI see you live in Highlands Ranch, I am in Parker... who is your doc?  I have an awesome GI/liver specialist... if you need one.\\n\\nIn addition, are you on any other meds?  Sometimes those can mess with your liver panel.  My numbers bounce from normal to an ALT of 950 and AST of 720, GGTP can be in the 300's and my indirect bili hangs out at between 2.0-4.5... so I understand.  Liver stuff is scary, but it is not uncommon to have little blips every so often.  Do you have a history of gallbladder problems? That could be the culprit... sometimes your pancreatic functions can cause the liver to go a little wonky too... my liver issues are from Crohns disease, and the meds they have tried to treat the crohns with have made my liver irritable....\\n\\nJust some suggestions... hope I helped a bit!\\n\\nzarra\\nHi Al,\\n\\nZarra is right.  There are several things that can caused the liver to act screwy.  For a while I too had dark urine which had bilirubin in it.  That was caused by the Common Bile Duct being blocked.\\n\\nThis happened after surgery in April 2000 to remove the gall bladder and nissen fundo for reflux.  Apparently I am one of the 3-5% of people (if you listen to my old PCP the chances are Zero) who will still pass stones with no gall bladder,\\n\\nAfter two attacks that felt just like the gall bladder attacks, my GI did an ERCP on me.  This is like an endoscopy, only they go further (into the pancreas) and inject a dye so the duct work shows up on x-ray.  While he was in there he cleaned out the CBD which was filled with sand/sludge.  He also did a sphinctometry - cut open the valve open between the CBD and the intestine.\\n\\nAfter that the bilirubin dissappear from my urine.  Along with all the other things like protein that was wrong with it.\\n\\nGood luck to you and hope you find out whats wrong with you.  Bilirubin is not normal...\\n\\nHugs\\nReeAnn\\nThanks Zarra, I trying to keep this all in perspective.  I don't know how concerned I should be.  I had an ultrasound about 2 weeks ago and it came back normal.  I've also had a couple of more blood tests since the last email.  My total bilirubin last week was 1.7 (.3 direct and 1.4 indirect)Normal is 0-1.6. My ALT has jumped up over the last 3 weeks.  Last week it was 93,(scale of 5-72) and Alk. Phosph. was 136 (scale of 45-135).  This week my Alk. Phosph. was 126 (which is in the normal range), ALT was still 90 (after being off Lipotor for 2 weeks) and total bilirubin was 2.1. (.3 direct and 1.9 indirect).  So, bottomline, my bilirubin and ALT are still above normal.  I haven't drank alcohol since 1/5/01, and have been off Lipotor for 2 weeks - negative ultrasound -- I don't know what to think, or how concerned I should be. I think I probably have Gilbert's which is not a big deal, but I guess what concerns me is the elevated ALT in addition to the indirect bilirubin.  Thanks.  Aaron  By the way I used to live in Parker until about a year ago!\\nAaron\\nAaron,\\n\\nWith numbers like those, I would not freak out.  Just keep an eye on them.  The numbers you are reporting are just a hair above normal and my doc doesn't get wigged out about them.  Like I said before, it isn't uncommon to have blips - the Lipator could have caused the rise in the liver numbers.  Sometimes when your liver is acting a little sluggish (which it is) it can take several weeks to clear the itself.  Our livers are like a REALLY busy office -- somethings are priority and have to get done NOW (like producing bile for digestion) and cleaning other impurities from our blood - and then somethings are not really deadline specific ie I'll get to it when I can... I think that MIGHT be whats going on here.\\n\\nI know for a fact that my numbers were so crazy and having at the time just loosing my gallbladder, my liver went into a tail spin - it took months and months to get it all sorted out.\\n\\nThe moral of this story is: wait this out and see what happens.  It sounds like your liver numbers are recovering, and I know that my doc would not be really excited over these numbers - especially with the normal ultrasound.  You numbers are not that far out of the range and you should be fine.  (That's just my medically minded way of thinking any way)\\n\\nTake care,\\n\\nzarra\\n\\ndisclaimer: I am not a medical doctor, I just play one on TV\\nThanks Zarra.  Question -- do you know if an Ultrasound can see the back side of your liver?  Inside the liver?\\n\\n\\nAaron,\\n\\nSorry for the slow response here.  The answer to your ultrasound question is: yes and I don't know.  It can definatly see 'inside' the liver because they are always looking at my common bile duct which I think is pretty centrally located.  Seeing the backside of the liver?  I am not certain but I know in the 12 liver ultrasounds I have had, they have rolled me onto my side and been able to do some exam from that side.  I know they look at the kidneys on the back side, but not sure about the liver.  Good question.  I will have to go hunting now for that one!  Hope you are well\\n\\nzarra\",\n",

I was at work and felt cramping around my navel.  I brushed it off because I usualy have pain every day.  I got home that night and it got worse.  The pain was so intense.  I started to time my \"contractions\" as I call them.  They were every 1.5 minutes for about 25 saconds each.  The pain just lept getting worse throughout the night.  I couldn\\'t sleep it was so bad.  I finaly got the energy to get up and had to run to the toilet to throw up.  I usualy feel better after I do this.  This wasn\\'the case this time.  My contractions got further apart, but they were much more intense.  I couldn\\'t take it any longer so mu brother rushed me to the hospital where I waited about 6 hours just to be taken into a room and the waited another hour to finaly get some blood drawn and then had to wait another 2 hours for the results to come back and about another half our for a damn doctor to show up.  By this time my pain started to subside.  I was finaly hooked up to an I.V because I was severly dehydrated.  I was then sent home as if nothing happened.

He says that I might want to have corrective surgery done.

Anyway, the surgery corrects the problem in the esophagus that causes the reflux. Has anyone had this surgery done? I\\'ve heard good things about it, just wanted some feedback.\\n\\n[This message has been edited by kdoubleu (edited 12-15-2000).]\\nI would not consider such a surgery...reflux almost always heals with care, and surgery is always radical, and may not heal or may cause infection...it is not worth it in such a minor illness.\\nBesides if it isn\\'t broke why does a doctor want to fix it?

Get a copy of \"Protein Power\" by Dr. Eades (about $6.00 at any bookstore or online at ******.com).  This is discussed in the book as a fix for your problem.  Cutting way back on sugars and starches (all grain products, bread, pasta, corn, rice, potatoes, etc.) helped me tremendously.  I can\\'t remember the last time that I had heartburn or acid indigestion.\\nI appreciate your responses. Arkie6, I am on a hypoglycemic diet, which is an elimination of sugar and starches. And I follow all of the tips friend posted. Yet I still have discomfort. I do intend to go to more than one doctor, and will consider every other possiblity before surgery. There is no urgency, so I have time to consider this. Keep the advice coming, I\\'m eager to find a non-invasive solution!\\nsome refux problems can only be solved by surgery because the valve at the bottom end of the oesophagus doesn\\'t work properly in keeping food/liquids in the stomach, maybe trying a different drug will help or taking a antacid liquid before bedtime/after meals.\\n\\n\\nDear KDoubleU,\\n\\nThe surgery you referred to is laproscopic nissen fundoplication.  I had this surgery as my reflux/GERD was severe, had a hiatal hernia and my esophagus was badly ulcerated by the constant acid bath.  This is rather radical surgery - having you stomach wrapped around the esophagus to form a new valve.  I would not recommend it to anyone except as a last resort...\\n\\nThere are two newer procedures the FDA has recently approved that show a lot of promise in helping with Reflux/GERD.  One is the Stretta which uses some kind of electrical wave to create scar tissue and tight the valve between stomach and esophagus.  The other procedure is the Bard with does basicly the same thing with stitches.\\n\\nBoth of these procedures are done endoscopicly with little recovery time.\\n\\nI did see someone had posted some good lifestyle change suggests like raising the head of the bed.  Try these and an adjustment (with your doctor\\'s help) in medications before considering any procedure.  You might want to try one of the PPIs like prevacid.  Sometimes one medication will work better than another.  Or maybe your dosage isn\\'t high enough.  I have heard of some people taking 120mg per day of prilosec.\\n\\nWish you with this.  Please keep us posted on how you are doing...\\n\\nReeAnn\\nMy sister had the fundoplication surgery and would give anything to take it back.  She sufferred from permanent nerve damage from the surgery.  Also she can no longer burp or vomit, she suffers from severe bloat and has had to have additional surgery  to repair adhesions she got from having this surgery.\\nI am sure their are thousands of people who had this surgery successfully and are happy with the results.  But if surgery can be avoided then I would definitely avoid it. If you can change your lifestyle and get on the right meds, I would do that before I would jump into surgery.\\n\\n[This message has been edited by Dusty (edited 01-25-2001).]\\nI meant to add that it took my sister over a year to heal while following the suggestions I posted above.\\nBut she did heal.\\nThank you for your responses. They are very informative and useful. I would not have even considered surgery if I hadn\\'t exhausted so many other avenues. I have followed all of the tips (plus others) friend posted for almost a year. And I tried Prevacid, which didn\\'t help, and am now on 40mg of Prilosec. My doctor is concerned that this may be too high of a dose to stay on. I intend to see other doctors to get further opinions. The 40mg of Prilosec keeps the GERD at bay, so I am not feeling rushed to have surgery done. And I am always hoping to find an alternative suggestion that I haven\\'t tried, which is why I posted here in the first place.\\n\\nRee Ann, I will check with my doctor about exactly which surgery he meant for me to have done. It sounds like the one you had is rather too radical to consider just yet.\\n\\nI appreciate hearing from people who actually had the surgery done, or who knew people who had it done. I\\'m going to continue looking for a non-invasive solution.\\nI disagree with most of the responses you have gotten.  I was miserable before my surgery and I vomited on a daily basis.  I have now had the surgery twice, each worked for about 2 years (it\\'s been three years since my last one & I\\'m thinking they may decide to re-do it again).  Recovery for me was not easy & I ended up with a hernia on the last one.  But...now that everything is all said & done I would (and will) re-do however many time they  need to do it.  I had 2+ years after each one of No Heartburn, No Chest Pain, & NO VOMITING!!\\n\\nLike I said earlier, recovery was NOT EASY for me but I think it was worth everything I went through.  Do make sure you have a Doctor who has done this procedure many times before you and do get a 2nd opinion for peice of mind & to make sure they come to the same conclusion.  As far as everyone else\\'s opinion...it all depends on how bad you are now & what getting better is worth to you.\\n\\nBest of Luck!!!\\n\\n------------------\\nThe Breezee Blonde\\n\\n[This message has been edited by Breezee (edited 01-30-2001).]\\n\\n[This message has been edited by Breezee (edited 01-30-2001).]\\n\\nThat\\'s exactly how I\\'m feeling right now.

Just let me say that you sound almost exactly like I was just a few weeks ago.  For about 2 years I suffered with alot of the same problems you are having.  Finally after ruling out alot of diseases such as Reflux, GERD, etc, my dr had me go for an ultrasound of my gallbladder.  Sure enough, I was full of gallstones.  Last Tuesday, I have my gall bladder removed and can already feel the relief.  I did develop stomach flu over Christmas, so I am not totally recovered from the symptoms I had before the surgery.  Has your dr discussed possible gall stones at all?  The big thing that said it all for me was pain in my chest, going into my back and just below my ribcage on my right side.  Maybe you should have your dr look into you possibly having an inflammed gall bladder if he/she hasn\\'t already.  Hope this helps.\\nLet us know how things go.\\n\\nI came to this site hoping to find someone with symptoms similar to mine.  Given the unique nature of my condition, I didn\\'t expect to find anyone.  Amazingly, there is considerable overlap in our symptoms.  I am a 27 year old male and have had strange gastro-intestinal behavior for the past 3 years.  I too have bloating, extreme gas (belching), shortness of breath, and heart palpitations.  The breathing problems and palpitations seem to occur together, but not necessarily with the gas and bloating.  I also get itchy, red eyes and sometimes scalp itching.  I don\\'t know if it\\'s related to the GI stuff.  I will often feel fine until I eat, and then my symptoms occur.\\n\\nI have been given lots of drugs like Prevacid and some stuff to treat IBS.  None of them do any good.  I\\'ve had CT scans, ultrasounds, MRIs, tons of blood tests, a sigmoidoscopy, an endoscopy, and the barium swallow test.  They are all negative.  The only sign that anything is wrong is a stool sample that showed that my levels of beneficial bacteria are low.\\n\\nWe also have lifestyle similarities. I also use to have problems with diarrhea when I was younger.  I was told that I had a nervous stomach, but the problems subsided once I gave up dairy products.  I also use to lift weights heavily and was an athlete for many years.  When my GI symptoms started about 3 years ago, I began to lose weight.  I lost about 30 pounds before I stabilized.  That put me at 6\\'0\" tall and 130 pounds.  I have managed to get back to 150 and it has been very difficult.  I have learned to live an almost normal life with this strange condition, but there are times when it really makes it difficult to function.  I wonder if we fit a certain profile that is susceptible to this unusual condition?\\n\\nLately, I have been taking lots of digestive enzymes and beneficial bacteria supplements.  The gas and bloating are much better, but certainly not cured.  I also must avoid sugar and alcohol to feel well.\\n\\nOne of my theories based on articles that I\\'ve read is that I\\'ve possibly damaged my intestinal walls by eating foods (dairy) that I couldn\\'t digest for all those years.  In some cases, certain food particles get in to my blood stream, and my immune system turns on itself and attacks the particles, thinking of them as invaders.  I don\\'t know if it\\'s coincidence, but a lot of my symptoms are similar to those that would accompany an allergic reaction.\\n\\nIf anyone has any insight here, I would really appreciate it.\\nyour cornucopia of symptoms sounds alot like what I went through (and am still going through) this past year and now....I had Laproscopic Colestectomy in June 2000...felt a lot better for a month or so after...then I started getting this burning, gas-like pains in my upper stomache and the \"runners stitch\" like pain near my gallbladder area again...new it couldn\\'t be that though, since I didn\\'t have a gallbladder...I kept popping asprins (big mistake) and alkaseltzers (again, big mistake) to relieve the pain...nothing seemed to help...I just kept getting worse...only putting food in my stomach (depending on what kind, nothing acidic) temporarily relieved the pain..there just seemed to be an \\'uncomfortable\\' gnawing in my stomach and upper right side...finally I couldn\\'t take it any more. I went back to my gallbladder surgeon and told him of my pain....he put me on Aciphex while he sent off labs to later diagnose me with H. Pylori...the Aciphex (though it gave me a headache)...made me feel 75% better immediately...no more \"runners stitch\" side cramps..and a lot less stomache/gas-like pains..though my stomach still has problems...I go this week to start my \"triple theraphy\" to eridicate (hopefully) my Pylori....(which I probably got as a result of my GB surgery anyway....\\n\\nI know how it feels to be totally frustrated about anything/everything you put in your mouth either having you running to the bathroom or bending over in cramps...keep bugging the docs and letting them know where the pain is....remember, the squeaky wheels get the appropriate treatment (hopefully anyway)\\n\\nTake care and hang in there.\\n)\\nHi! your symptoms sound like possible candida colonization in the intestinal tract.  These critters live all over but when they over populate, they cause nothing but problems.  My son and my husband both have an overgrowth of candida.  I would have to advise you to look up the Great plains laboratory on the internet and call Dr. Shaw, he will give you a free consultation over the phone.  His research lab does tests for yeasts, bacterias, and inborn errors of matabolism as well as many other tests.I wish you the best. kris',\n",

Remission is when you don\\'t suffer any symptoms, except the bathroom problems, an attack is when you get all the pain and sickness. As for med\\'s theres quite a few different kinds to treat different things. I always have diarrhea with mine, and I lose weight when I get a flare up. You should try and avoid dairy products during an attack.

The only time dairy bothers me is if I\\'m in a flare so I\\'ve learned to avoid it at those times.  The pain in your belly and blood in your stool will be because of the crohns.  Don\\'t leave it long before you go to a doctor because it can become very, very bad quickly.  I would recommend taking  calcium with vitamin D pills.  We have absorption issues with crohns and because steroids are sometimes used to control a flare we are more susceptible to osteopenia or osteoporosis  so if I were you I\\'d start these now.

Unfortunately oxycontin is a narcotic, but for those of us who can\\'t take anti-inflammatories we aren\\'t left with too many choices. I\\'ve seen some people on here take neurontin and I\\'m going to ask my doc about that med. Is it your doctors who told you not to take nsaids? Mine told me that not all people with crohns or uc have problems with the nsaids so we tried celebrex, vioxx, mobicox and bextra but unfortunately I am one who can\\'t take them. What type of pain meds have you tried? Maybe you need to take a stronger dosage? Wish I had more suggestions for you. Fortunately the oxycontin works pretty well for me but I\\'d still like to find something that isn\\'t a narcotic.\\ni think you guys should consider using a NSAID in a PLO gel. These non-steroidals can actually be put into a gel that you can rub on and they will be absorbed into your blood stream. They should not mess with  you ulcerative colitis. They should not harm your stomach either. You will have to find a compounding pharmacist to make it for you.\\n\\n[This message has been edited by moderator1 (edited 05-18-2003).]\\nHi, I know the feeling of not being able to take nsaids. I have osteoarthritis and am allergic to nsaids. I take ultram(tramadol-generic) for the pain, and it is not a narcotic, but is for osteoarthritis pain. It doesn\\'t do a lot, but it does help some. Maybe this medication will be good for you to try. Hope this helps.\\nI was in a four wheeler accident while I lived in Alaska the four wheeler landed on my rear and I\\'ve suffered hip pain since. While in Alaska, I used to make willow bark tea, which has salicytic acid a natural and effective anti-inflammitory. It has none of the side effects like asprin does and it worked great for me. I would try looking for willow bark extract in a healthfood or pharmacutical store, or if you happen to know where a willow tree is just peel some bark off and boil it for about 5 minutes.\\nSome very good ideas to try. I\\'m in Canada though and I know ultram is not available up here (already talked with doc about it) and I\\'m wondering if the gel can be purchased here also as it has never been mentioned by any of my doctors. I\\'m going to check into it though. The willow bark is an interesting idea, I\\'ll look into that also.\\nGlycosimine, which has been discussed at length in various places on this board has helped me enormously with inflamation.  The liquid works far quicker than tablets due to better absorption from what I understand.  The key to having it work was to take enough and to take it consistantly.  Enough for me seems to be a bit more than 3 grams a day.  The one I use also has condriotin and msn.  The relief was about equal to or better than any of the nsaids I had ever tried.\\nThinking about giving this Glucosamine a try, as nothing else is working.\\nHow long does it take to work, show any improvements, days, months - someone told me it would be about 3months before any difference would be noticed!\\nAnyone know if you can buy it in liquid form from the health food shops in England, seen it in tablets only.\\n\\nPain levels are still bad and I\\'m seeing a physio for some manipulation to loosen the joints as they are so seized up she said.

I haven\\'t seen it here in Canada in liquid form but will check. The frustrating thing with me is that the docs have said if I\\'m having trouble with my sacrum because of crohns chances are no test will show it. Crohns or uc is bad enough then add arthritis and troubles are intensified big time. Will post back if I find glucosamine in liquid form here and good luck.\\nHi there, I too have back problems and a knee issue to boot. I found some liquid glucosamine on the internet called SYN-FLEX. I ordered it on line and it was delivered to my door a few days later. It seems to work OK. I have also used pills, but like the liquid better.  I have found that Glucosamine complex, along with MSM helps a little with the pain. Willow bark and meadowsweet both have salcin, but are better for the stomach. Problem with herbs is that it can take from a week to a couple of months to see results.  Most people give up when they do not get instant relief. So if you try them be patient. Blupleurum, ginseng, bromelain, and licorice are used in China to reduce pain from inflammation. I have not tried these herbs, but am considering to try them.\\nSorry it has taken me so long to get back on the how long for the glycosimine.  They say 8 weeks but I found that when I was taking the liquid in a large enough quantity (3 grams a day) I felt its effect within 3-4 days.  It did take longer to get the full effect.

Thank you.\\nYou can see signs of Crohn's and colitis radiologically (i.e. in a CT scan or on a plain film x-ray), but these are not the modalities that are used to diagnose the problem.  Inflammatory bowel disease is a pathological diagnosis, which means that you have to take a biopsy of the tissue and examine it under the microscope.  Now, the radiologist can look at an x-ray, note abnormalities and then fit these in with the clinical picture (usually the radiologist doesn't have much of the clinical picture though), but this is not a definitive diagnosis....you must get a pathology report to get that.\\nIt is my understanding that the best medical test to determine Crohn's and other diseases of the colon is a colonoscopy.

I have looked at hundreds of websites by now, and have myself having Crohn's, cancer, everything. I am seeing the specialist this week so will see what tests he orders. I hope he starts with something non-invasive like a fecal blood test. However, at this point, I would not object to a colonoscopy; I just want a diagnosis already. This is very unnerving. How long have you had diarrhea, and is it every day? A few times a day or just in the morning, and also, where is your pain? Steady or intermittent? Thanks.\\nterri48-inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) are usually diagnosed by endoscopy (sigmoidoscopy may diagnose UC, but total colonoscopy is usually required to diagnose Crohn's, since the vast majority of Crohn's diseases affect the terminal ileum (very beginning of the colon, where the ileum meets the cecum).\\n\\nother tests, such as barium enemas or upper GI/small bowel x-ray series can diagnose it. stool tests, such as testing for occult blood can aid in diagnosis. but, not everyone with IBD has blood in their stools\\n\\nalso, the other major symptoms of IBD are abdominal pain and almost always there is fever.\\n\\nedit-ps. it is very uncommon for IBD to develop in people in their 50s who have never had previous symptoms/problems.

I have been researching it on the internet for the last week but I would really like to chat with people who are going through it as well.  They say that my case is mild which is good but I am still scared.  I have never had anything like this happen to me before.  I do not know what to think exactly.  I am still in shock.  Any insight would be great.  Thank you\\nLissie\\nHi Lissie,\\n\\nThe information on Asacol is basically 5-ASA and is effective for some people.  My sister who has both Crohn\\'s and Ulcerative Colitis, was on that med.  I have severe Crohn\\'s and was on Pentasa.  It did not work for everyone.  You are in a mild stage which is good because if you keep diary of your meds and stick to a good diet you should be okay.  I have had Crohn\\'s for just over 9 years (diagnosed and had surgery) but have had it since 17 yrs of age.  If you are in a mild stage, ask your doctor about Entocort (insurance should pay for it, cause it is expensive) , yes it is a steroid but very mild with less side effects of Prednisone.  It should help maintain your flareups to a minimal.  I know you are afraid, but stress is a culprit to bringing it on worse.  Everyone is different on their symptoms and medications, my other 4 brothers and sisters have a form of Crohn\\'s or IBS.  Yes it is very hereditary.  Chew slow and stay away from raw veggies, popcorn and generally soft foods.  Stay away from smoking, alcohol and stress, they agitate the bowels.  If you must go on Predisone, dont let the doctor keep you on it long term, the side effects are not pleasant.  Oh you will feel fantastic,at the time, then the side effects kick in later.  Keep well if you have any questions, I could help.  Also being as I am a Canadian you also have an American CCFA Crohn\\'s and Colitis foundation.  Good luck, think positive.\\n\\nPenny\\n\\n[This message has been edited by moderator2 (edited 12-05-2002).]\\nHI Penny\\nThank you so much for responding to my questions.  I am now at week 3 and I think I am doing better handling the fact that I have a chronic disease that I will never get rid of.  So far I have only had one flare up and that was back in June/July.  It has taken the doctors this long to decide that it was Crohn\\'s.  I have slight inflammation in the last 6 inches of my small intestines and that is why I am on the Asacol.  I have been taking it for almost 3 weeks now and my stomach cramps seem to have just about subsided.  I have been keeping a diary for the last two weeks of what I can eat and when I go to the bathroom or have cramping.  I have an appt with my regular doctor tomorrow to go over everything and I want to get a referral for a nutritionist as I am trying to get pregnant and want to make sure that I am getting everything that I need.  I can not believe that you and all of your siblings have some form of Crohn\\'s and IBS.  No one in my family has it except me.  I do not quite know how I feel about all of this but I am doing better then I was.  It is really scary and the internet does not always help.  Thank you for your answer.  How often do you have flare ups?  Do you know what causes yours?  Are you able to do everything that you want to do?  Sorry for all of the questions but you are the only person that has answered back on several sites where I have posted questions?  Thank you again\\nLissie\\nHi Lissie, you are welcome.  Best of luck on getting pregnant, though I should warn you, when I was diagnosed with Crohn\\'s in the beginning the gastroenologist recommend I dont have anymore, turns out I chose a few years early not anyways.  The problem with pregnancy is you cannot be on a lot of medication or any if can be helped.  You sound like you are in the beginning stages and my first stage was when I was 17.  I had bad periods (extremely bad) and diarrhea,  contantly and every time I moved, (stress related) I got sick.  NO one really knows what actually starts it, but refined sugar (I admit probably too much of it) and a lot of stress in my life, which some I may have created.\\n\\nI have had one operation of 6 inches of intestine and was almost normal for 8 years, then I had a break up in a commonlaw marriage 4 years ago and it started up again.  My first attack since my surgery was last May 24th, July and early Aug.  They thought it was a \"twisted bowel\" but I knew from my old experience that it was an obstructed bowel.  Believe it or not it was from a lodged Bratwurst (chewy weiner) and have never eating one since, another was from a kernel of corn from soup.  I dont want to scare you because my symptoms this time around are not near as bad because I caught it in time.  I was on Prenisone, but finished the meds 2 weeks ago and had a colonoscopy, saying it wasnt all that bad.  I was not impressed with his opinion, cause I really have to watch what I eat.  My mother figured it out that every time I ended up in the hospital, I was on my period (everything swells)&gt;\\n\\nI was able to lead a normal life until this summer and now being on nothing is scary for me too.  But I have been on too many medications and they are now affecting my muscles.  I am waiting for surgery, but since we only have one surgeon, and I live in a small town (the surgeon is in Austrailia for 6 weeks) and now that the gastroenologist says his opinion, I will be on a long waiting list.  We have good health systems, just understaffed.\\n\\nI dont mean to pry, but could you tell me how old you are and how long you have had symptoms of Crohn\\'s?  My older sister never had pain until after her surgery, which they took out 16 inches, and she is on Ascol for her colitis as well.  Apparently that is pretty rare to get both.  She lives in PEI and I am in Northern Ontario, so we havent seen each other in 10 years.  She had this for years and they took so long to diagnose us all because we are not skinny.\\n\\nMy first attack I lost 40 lbs in 2 months and that\\'s how a specialist and a teaching doctor figured it out in downtown Toronto.\\n\\nMy advise, is unless your family doctor is up to date and knows alot about Crohn\\'s, mine doesnt, dont let anyone tell you how you should feel.  Everyone is different and only other patients can understand.  If Asacol is working, that is good.  Entocort is a good choice too, but up here it is $300.00 for 2 months. For mild to moderate.  There is an herbal remedy called \"Cats Claw\" which I have heard works, I am going to try it and bought Acidophilus tablets, started last night.  Tell me what your symptoms are and discuss every detail with your doctor.  Good luck!\\n\\nPenny\\nHi Penny\\nI just met with my primary doctor yesterday to discuss my disease and get a referral for to see a nutritionist.  I really like her and she said yesterday that I am her 3rd patient to have this disease.  She says that she reads up on it and she seems to know quite a bit but admitted that it was not her specialty and would be consulting with the gastroentologist regularly about me.  She also suggested that I see him regularly for awhile to make sure that all of my questions are being answered.\\n\\nI am 30 years old and had my first and only episode in June/July of this year.  I dropped 20 lbs in a month.  I was never overweight so this was alarming.  They did a bunch of tests over the next 3 months and just last month they did an Upper GI and small bowel follow through and that is when they found the inflammation.  I have a very mild case and since I have only had one flare up the scaring is minimal.  My symptoms now are just slight cramping below the abdomine about 4 to 6 hours after I eat.  The Asacol seems to be helping that and I only seem to have cramping at night now and it is nothing like it was before.  It is very minimal.  I never had any symptoms really until I had the flare up this summer at least none that I noticed.  Since I was trying to get pregnant at the time and stopped because I was sick I just kept going to the doctors to find out exactly what it was.  If I was not trying to get pregnant I probably would not have pursued it as much as I did and it would have been years before I was diagnosed.  The doctor said that I caught it in the very beginning and if I eat right I should be able to keep it mild.  (Hopefully)\\n\\nAs far as the pregnancy goes.  Both doctors told me that it is safe for me to get pregnant on the Asacol and if it is helping I should be able to take it throughout the pregnancy.  I do not know if I will do that though.  They said I should have no trouble with a pregnancy and that in 1/3 of the cases it even makes the symptoms better.  We just started trying again last month so I am waiting to see if I am.  I wanted to make sure that I was healthy before I had a baby.\\n\\nWhat do the Acidophilus tablets do?  I have been reading a lot on the internet and I do not remember seeing them mentioned.  I did hear of the Cats Claw but I have not tried that yet.  I am trying to keep what I take to a minimal since I am trying to get pregnant.  The other symptoms that I had/have are I was very tired, weight loss, cramping, loose/frequent stools, cramping, and anemia.  I am very happy with the doctor that I have and thankfully I have a wonderful health provider so everything has been covered with a minimal cost to me.  I only have to pay $15 each time I see the specialist or my doctor.  All of the blood tests and other tests were covered.\\n\\nAgain I want to thank you for responding.  I feel great having you to talk to about this.  I am fascinated that your whole family seems to have this diesease or a form of it.  Do your parents have it as well?  My doctors told me it was up in the air as to whether or not it is hereditary and from what I have read some say it is and some say it is not.  I do find it odd that they do not know what causes it.  I have been racking my brain trying to figure out something.  I do not like not knowing why I have something.  I already have a notebook filled with things to bring to my next visit with the GI doctor.  Take care and I hope you are feeling good now.  Please keep in touch.\\nLissie\\n\\nHi Lissie,\\n\\nYou mentioned the fact that a doctor told you that it is not heriditary, my mother or father, did not have any part of the disease, but my mother\\'s 2 brothers had IBS and my grandmother had gastroenitis and we found out her uncle has Crohn\\'s but didnt get any information.  Crohn\\'s has only had a name since 1976, dont quote me, but the Canadian Crohn\\'s and Colitis foundation was formed then.  Apparently in the earlier days, it was thought to be \"all in your head, syndrome\" and used to surgically remove  part of the brain, so it would disappear, so the story goes.  Hopefully it will skip another generation (or cure it)  someone, maybe a few generations could of had it or not even know what it was, or never diagnosed.  Face it people did not discuss their \"bathroom\" habits.\\n\\nMy mother read in an article that if you are in your first trimester with Rubella (German Measels) can trigger Crohn\\'s.  That case is rare, but that did happen to her which was me and I am deaf in one ear.  But my daily life is mostly the same as everyone else\\'s until a flare up starts.  Are you on anything for diarreaha?  I am on Colestyramine and so are my sisters, I dont take imodium, maybe 1 or 2 times a year, but lately I have only taking half a package every other day.\\n\\nAcidophilus capsules are good active bacteria, killing bad bacteria, which is what causes flare ups and inflamation of the intestines.  This is a natural product and you can get it from eating plain yogurt with high culture, but I cant stomach it.  I just started it, and doctors will not recomment other herbal supplements cause they dont make money on them and only your pharmacist knows reactions with other meds.  Ask them, pharmacist are a great help and you will be seeing them on a regular  basis.  Acidophilus must be kept in the fridge and on an empty stomach.  I am taking 2 capules for now, then back off after a month.  How severe are your attacks? How long were you hospitalized?  How much is affected?  I can only give you my experiences, and I certainly am not going to scare you, dont be like I was \"in denial\" cause you have to live with it and dont let it take over your life.  Do you have any support groups there? If you go to the american  crohn\\'s and colitis foundation you will get lots of info.  I go to [url=\"http://www.ccfc.ca\"]www.ccfc.ca[/url]\\nand check it out to see if things change.  Your specialist will do blood work to make sure your meds are not affecting you.  Dont be afraid to ask questions, I wish I had the opportunity when I started and did not have a computer then.  Dont worry about your weight, I try to keep on extra just in case.  Losing a lot of weight when you are at an ideal weight can cause for concern.  I still experiment, but I am still learning and trying different things.  Lately my gas pains were excruciating and I took 180 mg (2 tabs) of Simethicone capules, the brand name is Oval 180.  It helps, plus I take digestive enzymes with my meal depending on the size or how much protein, (hard to digest) Chicken and turkey are the worst for gas. I wont give up milk so I take Lactaid for dairy.  Can you digest milk products?  Whether this disease is hereditary or not, it aint going away.  We have 13 grandchildren to hope none get it. Let me know how you are doing.  As for the baby, they bring joy into you life and highly recommend it, I only have one daughter, but she is so compassionate, to my disease.  She was 4 when it took 8 months to diagnose, in an out of hospitals and test.  She is 15 and is a better person for learning, I am trying to get her to be a doctor, nooooooo she wants to be a Lawyer! Take care, laughter is the best medicine and it doesnt cost anything.\\n\\nPenny\\nHi Penny\\nI think I am doing better with this then I was at first.  The Asacol seems to really be working for me now because I have not had any symptoms in about a week. The Asacol is the only medicine that I am taking at this time.  They say that they caught it in the very early stages.  I have only had one attack and that was in June/July and it was not severe enough to warrant hospitalization.  I have been in out as far as taking tests but nothing where I had to stay overnight or anything.  So far the disease has only affected the last 6 inches of my small intestine.  My doctor said that with proper treatment we should be able to contain it to just that area.  He also sent me a free membership to the Crohn\\'s and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) so I sent that in this week and they should be sending me a bunch of information.  I seem to be Ok so far with most things that I eat.  I am OK with Dairy which is good because Milk is my favorite drink and I drink it alot.  I do tend to eat a pretty bland diet now.  I eat nothing spicy or with a lot of seasoning.  I am still in the process of trying to figure out what I can and can not eat.  I am suppose to be going to see a nutritionist soon.\\n\\nI do have one question for you.  Do you tell people what you have?  So far I have only told my family what I have but all of my friends and co-workers keep asking if all of the tests that I have taken have shown anything yet.  I have not told them yet because I wanted to get used to the idea before having to answer a lot of questions.  How do you handle it?  I know that they are concerned and it bothers me to lie to them but I do not know what to do.  Can you help me on this?\\nThanx\\nLissie\\nHi Lissie! My sister has crohn\\'s disease, and has had it since she was 15 years old, which was in the late 1970\\'s.  At that time in Europe, doctors didn\\'t know what was wrong with her, and she spent a long time in hospitals, and lost a lot of weight.  Between 15 and 18 years of age she was in surgery 2x (because doctors didn\\'t know so much back then), and in her 20\\'s she had a baby. What seemed to help her a lot was an intensive 3month psychotherapy treatment at a hospital with other very ill patients, which provided support groups and eased the coping with being diagnosed with this disease.  After several years of traditional medicine, she also tried homeopathic medicine, after being on cortisone for a long time, and wanted to stop it because she thought it wasn\\'t good for her.  For maybe 10 years she didn\\'t seek traditional treatment, and, unfortunately, the homeopathic medicine did not help against the inflammation.  A few years ago she went back for tests and her intestines were infected more severally.  She needed more surgery.  My advice to you is not to give up traditional treatment.  This could be damaging for you later on. For my sister, unfortunately, it was.  She had doctors tell her that they could try control the problem with herbs and homeopathic medicine, and she was more than happy to believe that. Now, it\\'s over a year since her last surgery.  She hasn\\'t done very well since then.  She thinks, that maybe her body is still healing.  She has a lot of diarrea, and has to stay close to bathrooms.  But one thing that has always helped her is her positive thinking about her disease.  She says, that she can get better and will get better. And, actually, for several years she was doing pretty good.  While it\\'s very unfortunate that she is sick, she is lucky to have a great husband, whose been very supportive and emotionally strong to help her deal with crohn\\'s.  i wish you all the best and hope, that today doctors know more about this disease to better help you.\\nLissie,\\n\\nI was diagnosed with Crohn\\'s in Jan. \\'03. I know exactly how you are feeling because I\\'m in the same situation. It\\'s scary because you have a disease that no one seems to no much about and getting answers can be like looking for a needle in a hay stack. I\\'m currently having a flare up and nothing seems to help. I\\'m on Asacol and Prednisone and wish this was just all a bad dream.\\n\\nBetyKate\\nI recommend that everyone here look into a probiotic product called Primal Defense. It is easily available online or at any Vitamin Shoppe.   The founder of the company had serious Crohn\\'s and was healed through diet changes and the product he helped develop. You can search online and read his story.\\n\\n\\nI take the product myself for yeast/candida and have been helped tremendously by it.    - Al\\n\\n\\n\\n[This message has been edited by moderator4 (edited 05-14-2003).]\\nHI BetyKate\\nI am sorry to hear that you are having a flare right now.  I hope that it is not a bad one.  I had a minor one myself at the holidays but I have been fine ever since.  I am still just taking the Asacol 3 pills/3 times a day.  I am now pregnant so I am constantly worried about that as well. I am past the first trimester finally so they say that my chances of miscarrying have severly decreased but I still worry that I will have a flare and that will do something.  If you do not mind my asking how old are you?  How long did it take them to diagnose you?  If you need anything just let me know. It is so frustrating to go to the doctor\\'s and just have them sort of look at you and when you ask a specific question they come back with well everyone with Crohn\\'s is different.  So they basically know nothing.  I am just glad that I am not going through this alone.\\n\\nHi LLR\\nI just found out recently that my paternal Gram had Colitis for years but no one ever talked about it.  Can you believe that? If I had only known in the beginning then I could have told the doctors and maybe I would have been diagnosed sooner.  I can not believe that so many people have it in your family.  Please keep me informed about you study. I am worried that I am going to pass it on to my baby.\\n\\nHave a happy and symptom free day.\\n\\nLissie\\nHi everyone, I have had Crohn\\'s for 38 years now.  I have had 2 surgeries and have over 3 feet removed. When I first started I had pain so bad that I would have to be knocked out. After surgery I went 32 years with out pain and then 5 years ago had to have more intestines taken out. I have never taken any medication for it, I guess I was a lucky one.  I also got pregnant with my 3rd child with Crohn\\'s and had him ceararen. There was no one in my family that has ever had anything with the bowels. Lucky me. I find that the busier I am the less time I have to think of my problem. I have been over seas 4 times and no problem. I watch what I eat, when I am having a problem, no milk, cheeses, spices, I watch my vegetable to keep down the gas. I am very busy and have a garden with over 500 plants, keeping busy helps. I find bending hard on the intestines and I usually sit on the ground. I went to the U. Of Chicago they have a wonderful department there. Yes, I do have the runs all the time, somedays I go like 25 times and normal is about 10. I also have 3 fissues in the rectum which gives me more problems, but which is part of Crohn\\'s.  I don\\'t heal good if I get sores, again part of Crohn\\'s.  Any one wanting to write me you are more than welcome.  I feel God gave me Crohn\\'s so I could help other people to understand it. Shirley\\nHi Shirley\\nI get so excited when I hear stories about people with Crohn\\'s having healthy pregnancies.  I can not believe that you have had it that long.  I think that you are a lucky one if you have never taken any meds. I have only taken the Asacol and it seems to be working for me.  I also tend to watch my diet but if I want something I do eat it unless I am not feeling well. I tend to pay more attention to my body now then I did before. I am just glad that they caught it at such an early stage for me.  Hopefully I will be able to keep it at a minimum since I found out so soon.  Those 32 years must have felt like heaven. I hope that I can go that long.  I try not to think about it myself. I tend to not discuss it with people either.  People know that I was very sick when I had my first flare last summer but it is at the point now when most people do not ask about it anymore so I have managed to avoid having to tell people.  I find the less I talk about it the more I can not think about it.  I have been worried since I got pregnant but my doctor\\'s have been great and say that everything is progressing fine so I just need to relax.  Easier said than done.  Nice chatting with you Shirley.  I hope to hear from you again.\\n\\nLissie\\n\\nHi Lissie, I had Crohn\\'s for 2 years before I finally found a Dr. who knew what it was.  I went from Dr. to Dr. and most of them told me it was in my head. I knew better. By the time I got to the U. of Chicago and Dr. Block I was in bad shape. Having small children I didn\\'t want to die and I made a promise to God if he left me live I would do every thing for kids.  I also was given 2 weeks to live. I had a 10 Hr. surgery on a Monday and that same day I was up walking and sitting. The next day they pulled all the tubes out of me and I was on my own. I was home the next Monday.  This last time I had surgery I was up out of bed the next day walking the halls and by the 3rd day dressed and make-up on. I was home within 6 days. Why am I telling you this? I just want you all to know that to not let Crohn\\'s rule your life, it didn\\'t or doesn\\'t. If I have to find a bathroom so be it, I find one. I have been all over Europe, drank my own water, watched out for spicey food and got along fine. When people hear me say I have a disease that can\\'t be cured, they can\\'t believe me. You must keep yourself busy and not think about it. Right this minute I am hurting (fissure) and I have to watch more so what I eat. One of the biggest problems I have is Potassism.  When that get low, I start from the legs on up aching. Then I know I have to take some. Since my system works very fast, I can\\'t take any time pills. No coated ones either. When I go out to eat  most of them time, my salad is coming through me with in the hour. (floating in the john).  Way over after of my life I have had Crohn\\'s and you learn to live with it. Hope I have given you all some hope.  God bless you,   Shirley\\n\\nHi all, what an amazing thread this is!\\n\\nLizzie, Catmama, or anyone else who has a Crohn\\'s Diagnosis, can you please tell us in more detail what your beginning symptoms were?\\n\\nThanks so much for sharing all your stories.\\n\\nGod Bless\\nA',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hey everybody,\\nI know I don\\'t come here as often as I should, and it seems when I do it\\'s just to wine. So here goes.....\\nFirst off, I feel like a hypocondriac. I know most of us have felt that way. I feel like I\\'m always sick and that people are starting to look at me like I\\'m just lazy. That really makes me angry. I went through the whole hashimoto\\'s thing, had my thyroid removed. I felt good for a while except for horrible headaches. I had my wisdom teeth removed and the headaches went away. Then three months ago I started with the stomach problems. Took me six weeks just to get into the Gastro, not uncommon I know but still.\\nMy half brother on father\\'s side has Crohn\\'s just diagnosed this year, and my aunt on the same side has had colon cancer. I have a second cousin on my Mom\\'s side with Crohn\\'s also. My Mom even thinks dad had some bowel disorder come to think of it. I keep remembering times when my stomach just didn\\'t feel right, the most recent two years ago on a trip to Florida. It started the same way as this time. I went to the Doc said I had discomfort on my left side and he promptly told me I didn\\'t have anything over there and said it must just be a virus. I was so mad. So I dealt with the discomfort and all that until it just went away. Now it\\'s back but has been a lot worse. I have been on different antacids with Nexium doing the best for me. Still I have days where my stomach is just messed up and I have to call into work, like today. I work with a bunch of guys that I think are getting tired of me being sick all the time. I have all the tests this month starting with abdominal CT scan on Friday followed by endoscopy and colonoscopy later this month. Hope it\\'s just an ulcer from taking Ibuprofen for my back problems a while back. Yes one more problem. I know I don\\'t have it that bad, and that I should be tougher, but today I\\'m just down. And that\\'s the way it is.\\nThanks for listening,\\nI appreciate these boards.\\n\\nNodi\\nSorry to hear you\\'re having such a rough run of it, Nodi.  My husband has Chron\\'s so we know a little about it in my family.  It could be that you do have it, the tests should confrim.  Have you  had any bloodwork done?  There are a few simple tests that could also aid in diagnosing this - Chrons is an autoimmune diseas, just like Hashi\\'s is and they do travel in families.\\n\\nI know from personal experience that avoidance of certain foods can make a difference in how you feel.  My husband was very sick when first diagnosed over 10 years ago (6\\'3\" and 145 lbs).  A few years ago his meds stopped working and he started feeling sick again - they were talking about putting him back on prednisone (steroids).  About that time I started eating very differently; I cut out all refined carbs (white flour and white sugar in particular)... He decided to join me and much to our astonishment within 4 days of not eating these foods his symptoms went away.  He has been symptom (and medication) free since 2001, just by not eating wheat (wheat is what triggers it for him; he can eat all the other stuff he wants [and often does\\n] but wheat sets him off big time).  His specialist was floored, but we were not - my mother has rheumatoid arthritis (also an auto immune disease) and when she stays away from wheat and night shades she is 90% symptom free as well.\\n\\nThere exists a link between autoimmune disease and leaky gut syndrom (LGS).  LGS is most often the result of excessive consumption of, yep, you guessed it, wheat.  You might feel a lot better while waiting for your diagnosis if you avoided wheat -  it\\'s worth a shot.\\n\\nNat\\nI never really ate a lot of wheat. Doctor told me to eat wheat so I went to the store last night and got wheat bagels, wheat bread, wheat crackers. Geesh. I will see how it affects me and if it is not good I will not eat it.\\nI am changing my diet to lowfat highfiber, hopefully it won\\'t be too difficult. I haven\\'t had a cigarette since Saturday so if I can do that, I can change my diet\\nI know it will be okay, it\\'s just another learning process.\\nThanks!\\nNodi\\nOh Nodi.... ******{hugs}}}} to you, my dear.  You\\'ve given hope to so many folks here.... Don\\'t you give another thought to your need for a kind word today.\\nI know two young people with Crohn\\'s, and they\\'ve both been in remission for a long, long time... Doing quite well, in fact.\\nI hope you don\\'t have it, but if you do... try not to despair.  Feel better soon... and good luck giving up smoking!\\n\\nI was diagnosed with Crrohns approximately 20 years ago after my appendix was removed during surgery for endometriosis.  It was removed as a precautionary measure since the enometriosis caused severe pain and they wouldn\\'t confuse this pain with appendicitis.  Well my pathology report came back that it was enteritis and with some follow up tests they determined I had Crohns.  This didn\\'t surprise me since my mom and grandmom had it.   The good news is that I have been in remission most of the past 20 years.  Occasionally, I will have flare ups but they are more like irritable bowel than inflammatory!  The bad news is since I have had other autoimmune illnesses like graves, etc. diagnosed.  I hope you do not have Crohns, but maybe irritable bowel which is more easily treated.  Crohns can be treated with steroids or a drug called asulphadine (sp?).  It is not a pleasant illness, but with appropriate treatment and a good doctor many people do well.  A good diet may help.    Until you are officially diagnosed I wouldn\\'t sweat it though.  Good LUCK!\\nTrial Drug Looks Promising for Crohn\\'s\\nNovember 10, 2004 04:02:36 PM PST , HealthDay\\n\\nBy Ed Edelson\\nHealthDay Reporter\\n\\nWEDNESDAY, Nov. 10 (HealthDayNews) -- A genetically engineered antibody that blocks an immune system molecule has produced promising results in its first use against Crohn\\'s disease, researchers report.\\nThe antibody targets interleukin-12, whose proper purpose is defending against infection. In Crohn\\'s disease, a flawed response to bacterial infection causes painful bowel inflammation; an as yet unidentified genetic factor makes the system go wrong, setting off a chain of molecular events that results in inflammation.\\n\\nAlthough the study was designed only to test the safety of giving the anti-interleukin-12 treatment to human patients, \"it was really gratifying to see that you could show a significant response\" in the form of reduced symptoms, said study author Dr. Peter J. Mannon, head of the clinical inflammatory bowel diseases research unit at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The report appears in the Nov. 11 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\\n\\nCrohn\\'s disease is one of two conditions that cause chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract and which together affect about 1 million Americans. The other is ulcerative colitis, which usually attacks the large intestine; Crohn\\'s disease generally attacks the small intestine.\\n\\nResearch has indicated that the attack in both diseases is due to an improper response by immune system cells, which release excess amounts of cytokines, molecules that attack the intestinal cells and cause inflammation. One cytokine-blocking antibody, infliximab (brand name Remicade), which prevents production of a cytokine called tumor necrosis factor alpha, has been approved for treatment of Crohn\\'s disease. It has been found to be only partially effective.\\n\\n\"We can think about inflammation as a chain reaction,\" Mannon said. Tumor necrosis factor alpha comes into action toward the end of the chain, he said, and \"if we can intervene early in that process, we might have more benefit.\"\\n\\nInterleukin-12 acts \"higher in the inflammatory pathway,\" and blocking it can be more effective than blocking tumor necrosis factor, said Dr. Lloyd Mayer, chairman of the immunobiology center at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, which participated in the trial.\\n\\nThe study included 79 patients with Crohn\\'s disease. Some got seven weekly injections of 3 milligrams of the antibody per kilogram of body weight, some got injections of 1 milligram of the antibody per kilogram of body weight, and others got an inactive substance.\\n\\nMore than 70 percent of the patients who got the higher doses of the antibody experienced remissions, the researchers reported. Blood tests showed decreased production of interleukin-12 and other cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, in those patients. There were no significant side effects.\\n\\nThe study is just a starting point, Mannon said, because the small number of participants makes it difficult to assess the lasting value of the treatment.\\n\\n\"There may be a powerful underlying effect,\" he said. \"That needs to be tested in a larger study.\"\\n\\nMore information\\n\\nLearn more about Crohn\\'s disease from the National Digestive Diseases Clearinghouse.\\nThanks for the info,\\nAfter all my colon tests they found that I have a spastic colon, so IBS. my stomach was swollen and my colon was swollen, but apparently the gastro didn\\'t think this was due to crohns since the biopsies of the polyps were normal. He said the swelling was probably due to the colonoscopy prep I had to do.\\nThe IBS may be aggravated by a pelvic mass that they found during my CT scan in September. First the CT scan said fluid filled, Now the ultrasound and transvaginal ultrasound show a complex pelvic mass the possibly involves the ovaries. I have an MRI on the 19th, my birthday.\\nI\\'m worried because it was suspicious in the first place becuase I\\'m on birth control and shouldn\\'t be getting cysts.\\nThanks again\\nNodi',\n",

       " {'post': 'I need some info on Crohns. Is it fatel? What are the symptoms? I read about it from Mayo clinic\\'s site, but, the symptoms mimick other thing as well, so I thought I would ask someone who is in the medical field or someone who has it. I was told that if you have rectal bleeding with Crohns, you\\'ll know it! It\\'ll be in the toilet, on the toilet paper and in the BM...is that true? I was also told that you bleed often with Crohns...is that true? Do you have nausea, fatigue, fever, dizziness, lightheadedness???? I\\'m trying to differentciate the symptoms between Crohns and IBS, IBD, and even Colon cancer. They all have SOOO much similarites. Thanks for your response!!!\\nIt\\'s only fatal in the most serious cases which is very very rare these days.  As for the blood, you don\\'t even have to have rectal bleeding with Crohn\\'s.  It depends on what part of your bowel is affected.  If you do get rectal bleeding, there is no certain amount that you have to have.  If you get mucus in the stools, a fever, diarrhea or loose stools, then these could be signs.  Some people with Crohn\\'s don\\'t even get these, they might just have perianal disease with a fissure or fistula.\\n\\nThe only way to be certain that you have the disease is by getting an upper GI and a colonoscopy.  A lot of diseases or conditions can mimic it.\\nAlso you can get nausea, and feel light-headed, and tired.  A lot of people with Crohn\\'s feel tired because they are anemic from losing so much blood, and from not having nutrients absorbed in their intestines.  However, once again, this occurs with many other illnesses.\\nI have Crohn\\'s disease, a pretty serious case, and it is not fun.  I bleed alot, horrible pain in the abdominal area, always weak, dizzy, tired, nausea every time I eat, you name it.  My bowel is stricturing and my illeum is ulcerated.  Probably won\\'t get any better.  Between prednisone and pain meds I keep it under control and can lead a half way normal life.  Without them, my life can really suck!!  Surgery is inevitable once the bowel scars more, but I\\'m trying to put it off as long as possible.  With treatment, it can be controlled, but doctors are mystified by it.  Often they push medicines on you that are extremely expensive that have side effects worse than the Crohn\\'s.  Getting it diagnosed is hard enough, have to have the colonoscopies, endoscopies, etc to make sure that is what you have.

I am lucky though because I have a very mild case with only the last 6 inches of my small intestines affected so far.  I am also 11 weeks pregnant right now.  I have only had one flare up this past summer and it took them about 6 months to diagnose what I had.  I have been on Asacol, 3 pills/3times/day since November and everything has been fine. The website mentioned above is great for getting information about Crohn\\'s.  You can also do some great searches about all of the different IBD out there and then you can compare the symptoms to try to pin point what you have.  Good Luck and if you have any questions that I can help you with please do not be afraid to ask. I am constantly reading up on this disease since lucky us it does not ever go away.\\n\\nGood Luck\\n\\n------------------\\nLissie\\n11/22/03\\nLissie,\\n\\nCan you tell me what symptoms that you have when you have a flare up? How did the doctors diagnose you with Crohns? Is this something that you can live with, without treatment as long as you can tolorate it?\\nHi! I have had Crohns for 11 years. I was diagnosed when I was 18 years old. It took the doctors a year to figure out what was wrong with me. It was only after an emergency surgery (appendix) that they found I had Crohns. I have been on everything possible, and had two surgeries. One removed part of my small and large intestine and the other to remove scar tissue. I was in remission for 5 years until 2003. We thought at first that it was just another flair up, but after a colonoscopy showed I had reaccurent disease. It is mainly in the small intestine. Right now I am on Imuran, Pentasa, Cipro, Flagyl and Darvocet for pain. I dont know what sucks more the pain I have or all the medications I have to take. I take 30 pills a day. The doc said that if I am not any better in a few weeks we will try Remicaid.\\nI am married, have a little boy and hold a full time job. You can have a normal life with this disease but it takes a lot of work and a really great doctor.\\nHang in there and keep your head up! If you have any questions I will do my best to help out! Best Wishes for a pain free day to all!!! One day at a time!\\nHi N2Golf\\nThe symptoms that I had was severe diarhea and after I ate anything I had severe cramping about 2 hours afterwards.  It happened when I was digesting my food.  Once the food it the small intestines then I was in complete agony. I lost about 25 lbs in 3 weeks too and I am not a big person so that was not good.  My anemia which I have had for years and been borderline with got worse and was very bad.  I had a high sedementation rate which meant that there was a swollen infected part in my body but they just did not know where.  I think that if I had not been trying to get pregnant that I would have just lived with it and not been diagnosed for years since it is not that bad with me.  But because of my trying to conceive I wanted to make sure I was perfectly healthy and I stopped trying until I was diagnosed and told it was OK to start again.  I do think that the longer you go without treatment the worse it will get.  I am on the mildest med and I have never had to take the steroids at all.  They say that as long as I am careful with what I eat and take my meds that I should be able to control my disease and keep it in check.  I do need to have a colonoscopy at some point but that will not be until after I deliver. They want to see if any part of my colon is affected as well.  At this point they do not think so.  I have not had another episode since this summer but those months of not knowing and all of those tests were awful.  If I were you I would try to find out right away because the sooner you find out the easier it is to live and deal with it.  If there is anything else just let me know.  I will love to help you.  A good doctor also helps.\\n\\nLissie\\nIt sounds as if though Crohn\\'s is diet related and therefore, I would love to find a Naturopathic Dr. who could help. I certainly don\\'t live in agony (knock on wood)The thing that confuses me the most, is that the radiologist said that there was \"uncertain small bowel wall thickening in the left quadrant\" Other than that, I have more IBS symptoms than anything. I don\\'t know, I think if I do have it, it may be so mild that they can\\'t tell or see it. I certainly don\\'t want to keep going through test after test. It sounds like a good Naturopathic Dr. would really do me some good.....finding one is going to be a challenge!\\nYou know, the strange thing is, when I got an xray from the regular Dr. He said that I had an inflamed muscle and put me on anti-inflamitories. The radiologist said, that there is a possible small bowel thickening in the \"upper\" left quadrant. Same place as the muscle inflammation. Now, if Dr\\'s can\\'t tell the difference in something that elementary on an xray, it doesn\\'t give me much faith in them for much else. I\\'m SO FRUSTRATED!\\nI recommend that everyone here look into a probiotic product called Primal Defense. It is easily available online or at any Vitamin Shoppe. The founder of the company had serious Crohn\\'s and was healed through diet changes and the product he helped develop. You can do a search and read his story!!!\\n\\nI take Primal Defense myself for yeast/candida and have been helped tremendously by it. - Al\\n\\n\\n[This message has been edited by moderator4 (edited 05-17-2003).]\\nmY MOTHER HAS HAD THIS DISEASE SINCE I WAS 5 YEARS OLD. I AM 42 NOW. I INTRODUCE HER TO THIS SITE. I KNOW SHE HAS WRTTEN TO SOME PEOPLE. I\\'M SURE WHAT HER NAME IS ON THIS SITE. HER REAL NAME IS SHIRLEY.\\nI E-MAIL HER THIS PAGE.\\nVICKY\\nThe causes of IBD is not actually known right now, the two major ones within IBD is Crohns and Ulcerative Colitis, and of those two, Crohns is the nasty one. There is no cure for either. Although (my understanding anyways ) Technically, In Ulcerative colitis, removing the damaged part of the large colon, is considered a cure. UC only effects the large colon.\\nBut the damaged part has to be really damaged.\\nFor Crohns, I know that there has been a medical experiment that is still possible on going, that a doctor introduced small, hard to see with the naked eye, worms and/or parasites, To treat at least the symptoms of Crohns, one test patient was doing quite well and has suffered little to no symptoms from her Crohns.\\n3rd world countries have the least amount of problems with IBD\\'s because our intestines are rather more sterile then theirs are, this doesn\\'t mean u get to go drink sewage water or swallow earth worms..\\nAnd even though the patient, who swallows the uhhh worms, are in protective capsules, the thought alone would make most people gag.\\nDiet and stress cause havoc with IBD\\'s, but do not actually cause the diseases. It appears that people seem to tolerate Pentasa the best drug wise. But @250mg each and the fact you have to take 8-16 a day, makes it really difficult places them in a pill box, for each 7 day week. There is one issue I will mention, and it isn\\'t to get anyone\\'s hopes down, I was (still am actually) being treated for Ulcerative Colitis with Pentasa, at the time I couldn\\'t seem to tolerate anything else, the second year when I went in to remission, and the doctor decided to pull me off of pentasa, after a month, I was in agony, so the doctor put me back on.. by the end of the second year, issues started coming up again.. by the first quarter on this year (2003) My problems began all over again, 3 weeks ago I had my third colonoscopy, the UC had returned. My doctor said my stress I have been having in the last 6 or 7 month may have brought it back on. The only problems were, I haven\\'t had any stress in the last 6 or 7 months and I was on the pentasa when the UC became active again. I tried asacol, only to be left deathly ill after taking it, and Now I am placed on Colazal. You take 3 a day. As for side effects, worse than the asacol, mainly nausea, nasty headaches and something has messed my frequency of BM\\'s..\\nWith all that is going on in your colon and no matter how bleak things seem, try to think positive.. negativity doesn\\'t help u, and people tend not to want to associate with you when you are. The medications prescribed can put a lot of patients in remission.. so never give up no matter how bleak issues might appear to u, and though I realize this is going to sound odd, but try to remember no matter how bad off you are, there is always someone worse off than you are.\\n(btw, for people who need to have a colonoscopy, preparation is worse than the actual test itself..and yes, they do give u drugs..If you find yourself nervous the day before, ask the doctor if there is anything you can have to make it easier to deal with it. But it\\'s really not that bad. )\\n(ok, no one throw rotten tomatoes at me please.)',\n",

       " {'post': \"Hello all,\\n\\nI have a question for you.....\\n\\nMy boyfriend has Crohn's disease.  He is the best guy in the world and I can really see myself staying with him for the long haul.  We've been together for about a year and a half.  The other night we had a discussion about family and he mentioned that he probably doesn't want to have kids because there is a chance of passing along the Crohn's disease.  Now, I know he's done a lot of reading about this and he says that people are split about whether or not it can be passed on from generation to generation.\\n\\nSo, I guess I'm asking if anyone has any knowledge about this?  Theories, personal experience, etc.\\n\\nI will stay with him regardless of his feelings about having kids, but I can see myself wanting kids in the future although not at the risk of passing along his Crohn's.  It's a horrible disease and I would not knowingly impose that on a child.  Please let me know what you all think.\\n\\nThanks!\\nBonnie\\nI think that there might be a possibility of passing the tendency to develop Crohn's on to offspring.  However, I think a lot can be done to prevent the disease from actually developing.  Delaying or avoiding vaccinations, especially under the age of two, could help by not overburdening a developing immune system in infants.  Also, breastfeeding for at least a year (2 would be better) would also do a lot for building a strong immune/gut in a child.  Eating organic foods, avoiding toxins in the home and yard, and generally living as healthy lifestyle as possible will benefit everyone, including Dad.\\n\\nGood luck\\n\\nKiki\\nBonnie,\\n\\nFrom all that I have read Crohn's disease tends to run in families. People that have a relative with the disease have at least 10 times the risk of developing Crohn's as the rest of the population --- according to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. Many doctors think that the disease does have a genetic basis.\\nIt may not appear until it's triggered by a virus or bacteria that provokes the immune system.\\n\\nAs you may know Crohn's is not a cureable disease at the present time. The goal of the present treatment is to relieve symptomes, control the inflammation and keep the nutritional defiencies corrected--- these can all keep Crohn's in remission. Kiki was right on target with her suggestions.\\n\\nBut, you know in todays world of Biogenetic Research ---there may be a cure developed in the future.\\n\\nI have been reading messages on this board for about 4 years and from the sharing that I have read about--- this is one disease that really scares me. The misery and very unusual suffering it can cause is almost unbelievable --- I am sure your boyfriend is well aware of it -- because he has been living it.\\n\\nGod Bless you both---Harry\\n\\nPS-- I have lost 2 daughters a 5 year old due to compications of the measles and a 15 year old in an auto accident. So, I know how to live with a broken heart. You can't live life on what might happen --- live it with Faith and Hope !!!\\n\\n[This message has been edited by Harry (edited 09-24-2003).]\\nThanks to both of you for the helpful information and encouragement!\\n\\nAnd to Harry.....I'm very sorry to hear about your losses.  It certainly makes my probelms seem so small in comparison.  Thanks for putting things in perspective and giving me hope.

       " {'post': \"Hi Everyone,\\n\\nI have been having the same problems for about a year now. I have chronic nausea, stomach pains, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, excessive burping, I get full after a few bites, 30 lb weight loss, blood and mucus in stool, and fatigue. My body temp is often 1-2 degrees lower than 98.6, I have traveled all around the world b/c I am in the military, the doctors say I have pernicious anemia (low B-12). I also have been having irregluar menstrual periods for the past year with severe cramps, vomiting, and heavy bleeding.\\n\\nThe doctor gave me a colonscopy and EGD which came back normal except for mild gastritis and a small amount of diverticula. I had a CAT scan which showed inflammation in my intestines. The doctor is speculating, but thinks I have Crohn's disease. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\nI am currently taking Phenergan to help with my severe nausea. It helps sometimes, but isn't strong enough most of the time.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read this.\\nIt does sound like Crohn's, though that would (probably) have shown up in the colonoscopy - ulceration in the bowels as well as inflammation, but I'm not sure enough of Crohn's to say that for definite.  That's just my experience of it.\\n\\nYour symptoms sound like what I had before it was diagnosed and treated.\\n\\nCrohn's *can* (but not necessarily in every case) affect the entire digestive process from the mouth to the rear end, I think in the form of ulceration.  I think the ulceration causes the inflammation, though that's just my logic on it.\\n\\nMy colonoscopy showed long streaks of ulcers thoughout my large bowel, a couple of them were in a bit of a bad state, but most of them looked like an normal ulcer you get in your mouth.  It's not like they're hard to miss with a camera and a light.\\n\\nA barium scan can identify whether there is inflammation in the small bowel, but you should be able to work that out yourself - when you eat a proper meal, do you get pains shortly into it, need to stop for a while, then in (for example) 5 minutes you're able to start eating again (and not feeling full)?\\n\\nI do feel a tad sorry for you, as in going through a colonoscopy and then still no diagnosis, that really sucks.  You might have to go through it again.  You might also want to seek out a second opinion.  I did and that's when things started getting sorted out (though the first opinion didn't go as far as a colonoscopy).\\n\\nI'm no expert, I'm not saying what you've got is Crohn's - the problem is the *o*utward symptoms are the same as for a number of other problems.\\n\\nI've done a small write-up of my experiences with Crohn's, which may be of use to you:\\n[url]http://www.legolas.com/mikes/27-03-03.html[/url]\\nI have also been going through alot to find out if my problems are Crohn's related. I will be having a colonoscopy soon but am very nervous about that procedure for a number of reasons (one of which is that I just don't think I'm ready to accept a possible diagnosis like Crohn's Disease.) I've researched Crohn's, and your symptoms don't really sound Crohn's related to me, but they easily could be, since they match so many digestive disorders/autoimmune disease.\\n\\nI have a disease called Celiac Disease, and I have had many of the symptoms you named. I felt full very fast, had some nausea, and lost almost 25 Lbs. I also had watery diahrea and many other NON-gastro related symptoms. You sound as if Celiac is what you may have...usually it is genetic but in my case, no one else in my entire family has it, so it doesn't HAVE to be genetic. You can get tested by requesting the blood work which is specific for this, and then maybe a biopsy to see if your small intestine has been damaged. This will reveal whether it is Celiac.\\n\\nIn the meantime, know you're not alone. I've been depressed and worried ever since my dr. told me he thinks I may have Crohn's in addition to Celiac, which means 2 autoimmune intestinal diseases instead of one, and that is very daunting to say the least. Good luck with whatever test you decide to undergo next.\\nHow old are you? My lover has Crohn's and says it wouldn't necesarily show up in a colonoscopy, and early stages of the disease usually show up in your early twenties. He also says that if these are new symptoms, like within the first year, that it is hard to diagnose. You should go see a gastroentronologist (sp?).\\nI'm 30, and I've been sick for about 18 months now. It began with vertigo, dizziness, and then difficulty walking and balance problems. Finally, I began having diahrea which was severe and exhausting, and lost a lot of weight very suddenly regardless of how well I ate. That's when I was tested for Celiac Disease, and had a biopsy which showed severe damage to the small intestine. I also was inflammed all the way from the top of my throat to the colon. However, the colon itself has never been looked at, which is why my GI doc suggested the colonoscopy. I did have some symptoms that were gastro-related as far back as my early 20s, but really the worst of this began when I was 28. I still haven't had the courage to schedule the colonoscopy, I'm hoping it's not as bad I think it might be, though. I'm wondering also if inflammation of my esophagus and stomach are symptoms of Crohn's, and how the doctors can distinguish what is just inflammation due to gastritis, and what is Crohn's related inflammation? I wonder what exactly they see that specifically makes it Crohn's? Also I'm curious how much of a role genetics play, because no one else in my family has Crohn's, but I know already that my intestines are in bad shape and am wondering if Crohn's can do that kind of damage, or if it is in fact Celiac Disease as my doctor has suggested.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I\\'m a 30 year old female recently diagnosed with an intestinal disorder called Celiac Disease. The treatment for Celiac is a gluten-free diet, which I\\'ve now been on for 3 months. Because I\\'m no better, and still have stomach pain in the area of my small bowel, my doctor has now suggested a colonoscopy to look for Crohn\\'s and colitis. This has me sooo worried, because I do not handle medical procedures well...I become very, very nervous about the sedation and the possible after-effects of such a procedure such as bleeding. My nerves have so far kept me from scheduling this.\\n\\nI\\'m also extremely worried about the possible diagnosis of Crohn\\'s or colitis. My understanding of these conditions are that they are terminal. I still haven\\'t come to accept the initial diagnosis of Celiac (not terminal, as long as the strict gluten-free diet is followed) and fear I cannot hear this possible awful news. Could those of you who have a colonoscopy please tell me the details of the procedure, what to expect, and how it feels during the prep and the after-effects? Knowing more may put me at ease. I\\'d also love to hear from any Crohn\\'s or colitis patients. Thanks in advance.\\n\\n\\n\\n__________________\\ngillian\\nHello,\\n\\nI have lived with UC for 4 years now. While Crohn\\'s/UC can be most unpleasant, it is not considered a terminal disease. IBD sufferers have a somewhat elevated risk of cancer, but it is not imminent. Get that colonoscopy! While not a pleasant proceedure, I\\'d sure pick another scope over something like a root canal. Good luck.\\nCould you tell me which part of the procedure was the worst? My fears pretty much revolve around being heavily sedated, and then the possibility of bleeding internally afterwards. I\\'ve heard there\\'s not much discomfort during the actual exam, is that true?\\n\\nBy what I\\'ve heard, a 36 - 48 hour fast isn\\'t universally the done thing, it was in my case.  That was easily the worst part for me, the laxatives were strong, and trying to make myself take the second (of two doses) dose took a good bit of mental persuasion :-(\\n\\nInternal bleeding - they may have warned me, I don\\'t remember, so if the warning was that seriously put I would have remembered it.  The two reasons I can think in which a slight amount of internal bleeding (ie. you\\'d notice a little after no.2 on first wipe) is if/when they take a biopsy, and if the back passage is fragile.  I seriously think that internal bleeding is the least of your worries.\\n\\n(Anyone correct me if I\\'m wrong, but I\\'m fairly sure I\\'m right about this) The colonoscopy consists of a flexible tube (with a tiny camera inside/the end) being inserted in the back passage.  I was sedated, I was conscious at the time, I could hear people talking faintly, (I had my eyes closed because I\\'m a complete pansy when it comes to anything medical :-)) but not aware of anything going on with my body.  They then examine the large bowel for anything dodgy, typically ulceration in the case of Crohn\\'s/UC.  If they find anything, a biopsy is taken.  Now consider that the intestines aren\\'t things to be heavily messed with, so the biopsy sample is going to be the smallest they can take.  However, it could be from an ulcer that they take it from, and ulcers typically hurt.  Again, I was under sedation, I felt pain for an instant, but then I was back to my own thoughts like nothing had happened.\\n\\nThe thing I find very odd is that I was given more sedation for the endoscopy than the colonoscopy.  I remember nothing from the endoscopy after the sedation injection.\\n\\nOne thing to note is that I\\'m fairly sure the primary reason I was sedated was because my back passage at the time was very fragile and painful, plus I\\'m a complete pansy wrt medical stuff.\\n\\nAnother thing to note is that for Crohn\\'s/UC, it is pretty much the definitive test for it.  It\\'s not a waste of your time.  I was diagnosed after the colonoscopy, but they did a minor test or two to confirm that it was Crohn\\'s and not UC (because they\\'re similiar from the point of view of that test).  IIRC the treatments are the same for the two diseases.\\n\\nI can\\'t speak much for UC, but Crohn\\'s is termed as \"chronic\" not \"terminal\".  Chronic meaning you can get repeat \"attacks\" of it throughout your life, more or less severe than the previous.  Terminal meaning that you\\'ll eventually die of that disease.  The doctors I talked to said there\\'s about a third chance you\\'ll never experience another attack, a third that you\\'ll have another attack but treatable through drugs only, and a third that you\\'ll have another attack and require surgery.  Surgery can\\'t cure the disease, it can still attack again afterwards, same chances as before the surgery, unless you\\'ve got a very specific and unusual case.\\nThanks for filling me in on that. So I guess the prep and the diahrea are the worst part. I\\'m just wondering what people mean when they say they had really bad diahrea. Is that literally being in the bathroom for hours at a time and having very painful stomach sensations, or is it more or less just annoying to keep running to the bathroom every few hours? I\\'ve had an endoscopy, but am so much more nervous about the colonoscopy. Also I\\'m wondering what an \"attack\" of Crohn\\'s or colitis feels like, because I\\'d like to compare it to my own ongoing symptoms and see if there\\'s a similarity. I have Celiac Disease and know that my small intestine is very badly damaged, but I have been on a strict gluten-free diet for 4 months now and am not any better, with the exception of gaining about 13 lbs. that I really needed to gain. I\\'m having perisistent cramping and painful feelings in my lower stomach, around both sides of the belly button region, and just feel like I\\'m swollen inside all the time. This is why my doctor wants to check me for Crohn\\'s and colitis. My bowel movements are very soft but otherise relatively normal. Does any of this sound like an \"attack\" of something like Crohn\\'s or colitis?\\n\\nI had bad stomach pains, worse than I had otherwise perhaps, I think hunger pangs but made worse by the ulceration.  At the time going for a no.2 was painful anyway, and going often made it worse.  Frequent, unexpected, urgent visits (but short) that pretty much go away when anything at all that can be got rid of has been.  If you\\'re staying in hospital for the duration, bring some comfortable toilet roll.  It\\'s an absolute godsend :-)\\n\\n\\nMainly the prep, IMO.\\n\\nOne issue here is I have no idea how bad my attack was relative to other Crohn\\'s sufferers.  I was told by the doctors it was \"moderate\", but what the heck does that mean without some kind of yardstick for me to compare it to.  I think my symptoms should have been mild, but made much worse because it was left untreated for quite a while (though I\\'ve heard much worse stories about how long it was left untreated).\\n\\nThe pains I got were pretty much equally distributed below ribcage and between the hips.  Long, drawn out dull aching pains that would go on for long periods of time (like an hour or so), then stop for a while, maybe a few hours and start up again.  Pains were usually during a significant meal, again about 20 minutes afterwards (meals took a while for me to eat - like an hour - because my small intestine was inflamed, so the food takes longer to get through the smaller space available, and also aggrivates the inflamed area a bit I think), then maybe an hour or two after that.  I never felt a positive desire to eat, instead of feeling peckish or hungry, I would just feel pain.  I\\'ve heard the pain described almost like someone is pulling on your intestines, a dragging feeling, but that kind of thing is difficult to relate, though I\\'m inclined to agree with the description.  I also got rear end pains (reason described in previous post), diarrhoea all the time, it felt like it was burning.  My doctor put me on codeine phosphate before the diagnosis, which basically shuts the gut down for a while.\\n\\nThe web address I have previously posted on this thread describes the issues I had with food.\\n\\n\\nIt sounds approximately right, if it also tallies in approximately with what I\\'ve said (re: long drawn out achy pains).

       " {'post': 'hi, i have just recently been diagnosed with mild ulcerative colitis.  i have been taking Asacol and i saw my doctor today and he says he wants to switch me over to Sulfasalazine because it doesn\\'t cost as much.  now i understand that the active drug in these two (5-ASA) is the same... but Sulfasalazine seems to have quite a few possible side effects that i don\\'t think i\\'m comfortable with.  such as the sensitivity to sunlight and possible change of skin color (yellowish-orange).  it seems he wants to switch because Sulfasalazine is much cheaper than Asacol.  but i would rather pay the extra money for Asacol and not have the side effects associated with Sulfasalazine.\\n\\nso my question is, has anybody here used Sulfasalazine and does it offer any actual medical benefit over Asacol?  i just don\\'t want to endure any unnecessary side effects just for the reduced price tag.  i\\'d rather not walk around with orange skin if i don\\'t have to.\\n\\n\\nhi quincy, and thanks for the reply.\\n\\nso 5ASA is the drug that treats UC?  what is the other active med that sulfalazine has that Asacol doesn\\'t?  does sulfalazine work better for treating UC than Asacol?  or are they both similar in effectiveness?  i\\'m going to ask my doctor this but i would like some 3rd party input as well.  basically, like i said, if cost is the only benefit that sulfalazine has over Asacol then it\\'s not worth the possible side effects for me.  i\\'ve been doing well on Asacol and have had no real side effects thus far (it\\'s been about a month since i started on it).\\n\\nmy UC is in the sigmoid colon... he didn\\'t say anything about the rectum though so i\\'m not sure about that.\\n\\nhe did say that we caught it early though, so hopefully that will be beneficial in the long run.\\n\\nas for symptoms... i haven\\'t really had many lately.  the reason i went to the doctor in the first place a couple of months ago was because i was having some rectal bleeding.  so my doc recommended a colonoscopy, but i couldn\\'t do that as i don\\'t have insurance and i just can\\'t afford it... so i had a flexible sigmoidoscopy instead (which was NOT fun by the way... i\\'ve heard people talk about how it doesn\\'t hurt... but mine did... i guess because of the inflamation)... anyway... he saw the inflamation and took biopsies.  he figured right then that it was UC but we had to wait on the lab results to be certain... and then a couple of weeks later i got a letter saying the lab results confirmed it was UC.  this all occured over the course of about 3 months... and by the time i had the flex sig the bleeding has almost stopped on it\\'s own.  back in november i was having the bleeding and i was having a lot of gas and sudden urges to go to the bathroom.  i even had to get up in the middle of the night a few times (which i\\'ve never had to do in my life).  but it was rather mild for the most part... worse at night than during the day it seemed... and it went away on it\\'s own.\\n\\ni\\'m a bit bummed out i guess... i mean, it could be worse... but you know.  i\\'m 24 and i\\'ve never had any health problems in my life... and now all of a sudden i have this.  i guess i don\\'t really know how to deal with it.  i never even get sick or anything... so this is all kind of new to me.  i get kind of scared because i couldn\\'t afford a full colonoscopy and i keep thinking things like \"what if there\\'s something higher up that the flex sig couldn\\'t see\" and what not.  but i don\\'t know... i just hope that Asacol works because i definately don\\'t want to go on steroids... hell i need to lose weight as it is, much less gain more (not to mention the other side effects).\\n\\nbut i guess i\\'ll just have to take it one day at a time and hopefully it will be ok.\\n\\nsorry for the long post, but thanks for reading.  it\\'s always nice to know there are other people in the same boat as you are... it\\'s just too bad it has to be a crappy wooden boat with holes in it instead of a nice luxury cruise ship with a swimming pool and rock climbing.\\n\\n\\nMichael -- I have used sulfasalazine and rowasa enemas. I did not get enough control from these  meds. Asocol is a god send and I have never been better. Once your on something that works dont switch! Good Luck!\\nthanks for the replies.\\n\\ni talked to my doctor today.  i told him i didn\\'t want to go on Sulfasalazine because i wasn\\'t comfortable with some of the possible side effects.  so he gave me a prescription to continue using Asacol.  so i\\'m pretty happy about that.\\n\\ni also asked him what kind of UC i had... and told me he would classify it as Proctosigmoiditis, which is the rectum and sigmoid colon... however, he told me that the rectum area wasn\\'t really that inflamed and the worst of my inflamation was in the sigmoid colon.\\n\\noh and quincy... sorry i wasn\\'t clear with my other post... but i meant to say that since i have been on Asacol i am no longer having any bleeding.\\n\\ni asked my doc about those enemas that you mentioned and he said i don\\'t need them since i am not having any problems right now... but otherwise that would be a consideration.\\n\\n\\ni will definately keep that in mind.\\n\\nthanks so much for your help.',\n",

       " {'post': \"hey ive had UC for like 4 years now and like 2 years ago i had a flare-up and ended up going to the hospital after which the doc get me some steriods and was tappered off of them within like 2-3 months and for the past two years ive been pretty symptom free. Just a few days ago i started getting some blood on of my stool. is this a flare-up and is there anyway of getting well again without seeing the doc or taking steriods?or is the only way to get better is to take steriods to induce remission. Thanks for any help\\nI have UC and was symptom free and on no meds for about 3 years and all of a sudden flare up and now back on asecol and am doing fine.\\nHi validated,\\n\\nWhere in the colon is your UC?  I was diagnosed 15 years ago with it limited to the rectum/sigmoid.  I've only been on 5ASA meds -- Asacol tabs and Salofalk retention enemas.\\n\\n5ASA is a wonderful med for UC, which can be used long-term.  I am on Asacol 8 daily and regulate my flares with the Salofalk.\\nI'll probably be a lifer on those meds, but at least I have no side effects such as on pred.\\n\\nThere are different types of 5ASA meds -- pills, sachet granules, retentions enemas, suppositories and foam.  None contain prednisone or like meds.\\n\\nDo a search on 5ASA  or mesalamine or mesalazine.\\n\\nHope this helps.\\n\\nquincy\\nthanks for the responses guys. When you guys had your flareups did they eventually go away or did they all require doctor visits\\nI don't usually go to my doctor anymore for flares, because I adjust my meds accordingly.  The Asacol stays the same (I only upped it once which was from 6 - 8).  I'm on the 8 now which is the constant because I don't taper down from them, just increase or taper the enemas.  I'm doing quite well at this time.\\n\\nI used to run to the doctor quite often the first two years, because when I tapered off the meds completely, I flared within 2 months.  So, between the doctor and I, we got it all figured out as to how I should use my meds.\\n\\nI see my doctor once or twice a year.  Once for sure, but if anything comes up like a change in flare or symptoms I make an appointment to check in with him.   This coming summer, I'll be having another colonoscopy.  That will be my 6th in the 15 years.  I hope it's OK.\\n\\nSo, where is your UC?  Are you having any diarrhea as well as the bleeding?\\n\\nquincy\\nIm not sure where my ulcer is, i really should know shouldnt I? This flare up im having there is either a spot of blood on the stool or 1 or 2 small lines of blood. I dont have diarrhea and the blood on the stool doesnt hasnt really happened alot. but the thing ive had UC for like 3 1/2 years and the only flareup ive had spent me to the hospital, so i kinda get freaked out when i see blood.\\n\\n\\nI am taking Asulfidine (sp?) 6 tabs a day and imuran 2 tabs a day. can the reflare up just go away? Im not to experienced in this. and yes i do go to my gastro guy for checkups\",\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi, I sure hope someone can give me some comfort...Several weeks ago I tried cutting carbs out of my diet.  Within a day or so I had diarrhea and figured it was my irritable bowel acting up.  Over the years it comes and goes so I didn't think much of it.  I started eating carbs again but I still had to rush to the bathroom alomost everytime I ate.  It got to the point that I would get really bad stomach pains after eating and have to rush to the bathroom with explosive diarrhea...Then I would feel better.  After a few days of this I started losing some of my energy.  Then, last week after eating of course I had to run to the bathroom with explosive diarrhea again and also saw blood and mucous in my stool.  Needless to say, this really frightened me.   Later that night it was bloodydiarrhea and so it goes for the next several days.  Sometimes I think I have to pass gas and blood and mucous come out.  I am getting a colonoscopy next week and the dr. of course won't commit to any answers.  I am 42, female and have been understress lately but I can't imagine this would be the cause of my problems.  The blood is red and sometimes the stool is formed and sometimes not, it depends.  Sometimes there is more blood than other times and the same with mucous.  When the stool is formed, the blood covers the stool.  I've been tested for infection as well as a cbc, all were negative.\\nI am sorry this is long but I hope someone out there has had a similiar situation.  I should also mention that my sister died 2 years ago of breast cancer.\\nOh, I had a colonoscopy 3 years ago, for preventative reasons.\\n\\nThanks in advance to everyone!\\n\\n\",\n",

The trials were conducted in the United States with a remission rate of 70%.\\n\\nGastroenterologist Joel Weinstock of the University of Iowa invented the treatment, a drink containing whipworm eggs, called TSO, short for Trichuris suis ova, made by a German company called BioCure.\\n\\nWeinstock came up with the idea for the treatment after noticing that crohns is rare in third world countries where parasitic infections are common. He believes that crohns is the result of an immune system in overdrive for lack of an infection to keep it busy.\\n\\nIf you prefer a dietary approach,\\nby Elaine Gottschall B.A., M.SC\\n\\nDiet for Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Diverticulitis, Celiac Disease, Cystic Fibrosis and Chronic Diarrhea.\\n\\nThe diet is strict, but it works.\\nplymouth,\\nI thought Crohn's disease has alot to do with being inherited?? Please Correct me if this is not right?\\nHi Cookie,\\n\\nI was diagnosed with Crohn's a couple years ago and spent a week in the hospital although I didn't need surgery.  I was very sick, lost a lot a lot of weight and I was in a lot of pain.  However. I'm here to say there's light at the end of the tunnel.  First off if she's been diagnosed you're doing great, that's half the battle.  When I was in the hospital they put me on intravenous feeding because I was having trouble keeping food down.  They also put me on strong steroid for the internal inflammation.  I continued to take steroids for a few months and tapered off slowly. Since then I've been on 6MP which is an immune suppressant and I haven't had a bad flare since.  They say the first time you get sick will always be the worse because you don't know the signs to watch out for.  In the future she'll know she's flaring and can immediately see a doctor.\\n\\nThe only way to completely remove crohn's is to take out all of your bowels and use an external poop bag.  Instead, doctors tend to take small portions at a time and since your intestines are veryyyyyyyyy long, a couple feet doesn't make much difference.  So surgery isn't a bad thing.\\n\\nSince she's young it will be good to give her a lot of emotional support. You can tell her there are a lot of worse things in this world to have than Crohn's and you start to realize everyone has some type of chronic disease, mental or physical.  Some people suffer from chronic bad attitudes and there's no cure for that either.  It's just something you live with, like some people have to live with going bald, losing their teeth or bad skin.  She has to live with a little bowel disorder and you get used to spotting bathrooms.  It becomes a talent\\nShe'll get through this and enjoy life all the more.\\nHello,\\n\\nYes, we been told crohns you get from inherited but we dont know of any one in my husbands family that has or had it ..\\n\\nBut, we are worried our daughter or grandchildren will get it ..\\n\\nFrom what i understand if a person is blocked they will do surgery to remove the bad intestines...\\n\\nSome people may be left with one of them bags my husband had wanted one with his 1st surgery 20 years ago i said you are crazy to want one ..\\nThank god he didnt get it ..\\n\\nhes had 20 good years of not having to repeat surgery thank god ..\\nBut, yes he gets spells lots of times thru out the year sick feeling, and cramps that pass in time and ect and ect..\\n\\nHe can be on the toilet alot also..  thats why he takes so much meds for the bowels..\\n\\nWhen we didnt know at first what was wrong he was bleeding really badly also and they couldnt figure where it was coming from..Plus, he was on the toilet alot too ... And he lost alot of weight also..\\n\\nLike i said before they sort of acted like they didnt know much about crohns yet.. he was in hosp for 2 wks and he lost count of the 1st week he has no clue what even happened to him ...\\n\\nCookie does your neice use the bathroom alot also?? Has she ever tryed any of the bowel meds to slow it down ??\\n\\nBut, then they got to stop that bleeding on her ...\\n\\nNow, my husband is about blocked again so we are to try some new meds if that dont help heal the area i guess surgery again to remove the bad area..\\n\\nShorter you go more bowel problems you seem to have ..\\n\\nMy husbands stomach is so hugh hes so bloated cause of the blockage ...\\n\\nSeems to be lots of stuff on the internet that will help you understand about crohns also..\\n\\nCookie I hope they can help your neice soon ...\\n\\nTake Care\\n\\nPrayers are with you all ..\\n\\nLolly\\nUpdate On Niece,\\nFirst I Want To Thank All For Your Response To My Nieces Problem.\\nShe Had A Cat Scan Today, And Yesterday She Had The 2 Pints Of Blood. She Loses The Blood In Her Bowel, She Is Really Sick In The Morning, As The Day Goes By She Gets A Little Better. I Just Read There May Be A Pill Coming Out Soon That Helps With Crohns, God I Hope That Is True, There Must Be So Many People Suffering From This, I Pray They Find A Cure. Any Thoughts Or Ideas That Would Help Lead Us In The Right Direction In Getting Her Help Is Greatly Appreciated. I Want To Thank Everyone Who Has Written And Given Advice , I Think The Best Way Is To Talk To People Who Have Gone Thru This To Help With Help And Direction And Any Kind Of Relieve She Can Get.\\nMy Prayers To All     Cookie\\nI do not know alot about crohns but my best friend has\\n\\nhad it for 23 years. She is put in the hospital 1 or 2 times\\n\\na year do to flare ups. I know she has had ** alot } of her\\n\\nintestine and polyps removed over the years.  I wish your\\n\\nneice the best of luck.  Haylee\\nI also have crohns diagnosed 3 years ago.  I'm on imuran and asacol to try to keep it under control.  Sometimes the meds work, sometimes they don't.  I tend to end up in the hospital on average once or twice every year.  As for crohns being inherited, it is not actually inherited but is known to occur in families.  Too me that would mean it is inherited but the doctors say no, thats not what it means.  I had to have a colostomy temporarily (the bag) while a fistula healed and I would never go that route permanently!!  The bag won't permanently cure crohns anyway.  It can occur anywhere from your mouth to your anus.  Good luck with your niece and let us know how she is doing.\\nTham\\\\nks for updates on people with crohns, my niece did get 2 pints of blood last week, they put her on a new pill for abdomin pain, and she seems alittle better. Will update on her progress. Thanks again all     cookie\",\n",

       " {'post': \"My name is Jennifer and I'm hoping that someone out there can be a support to me and my family.  My dad was diagnosed with UC in the fall of '02.  It has been a downhill battle ever since.  He is only 52 yrs old and recently retired from his job as Chief of Police.  He expected to enjoy an early retirement to its fullest, but sadly, he has been so sick with UC that he is barely able to do anything.\\n\\nHe was on asacol briefly, but it began to cause problems with his kidneys.  Now he is on basaliside (sp?), 6MP, prednisone, an anti-cramp med, and i believe one other med.  As each med has been added or upped, promises have been made that this is finally the one that will help him regain an active life.  His entire colon is ulcerated at the time of his last colonoscopy.\\n\\nI was at my parents house tonight and he isnt even able to leave the bed.  He is experiencing severe cramping, urgent bowel movements which have included blood the past 2 days.  It feels as if all efforts are only worsening the problem.  I found this site and am posting as a last resort to find some support.\\n\\nMy best friend was diagnosed with UC in '97, but she too finds herself feeling without much support or adequate information.  Her UC is limited to the lower regions of her colon and seems to be a bit more manageable.  However, she was recently diagnosed with fybromyalgia in connection with the UC.  Is this common?\\n\\nIf anyone has any advice concerning doctors, meds, treatments, or just encouragement...it would be GREATLY appreciated.\\n\\nThanks so much!\\nbecause of Him,\\njennifer\\nhi, i have UC, but i can't really answer your questions because fortunately i haven't had any major problems with mine so far.  it started out as blood in the stool and some mild/moderate cramping... but i started taking asacol back in january and i haven't had any problems at all since then... so i'm afraid, even though i have the same disease, that i can't really offer much support or information because i've never gone through what your dad and friend are going through.  however, the reason i wanted to post is to wish you good luck and i hope everything turns out ok for you and your family.  i know it's hard to get support from people who don't have a disease and have no idea what you're going through, if not physically, definately mentally.  i recently decided to participate in a clinical trial for a new UC med and i had a hard time trying to get my family, in particular my mom, to understand why i wanted to do it.  it's hard to explain to someone how you are feeling when they really have no idea.  but hang in there, and i know there's some other people on this board who have UC that can be more helpful to you.\\nthank you so much for taking the time to reply.  its good to hear that you're uc is currently under control...its an encouraging thing.  i pray that things go well with the clinical trial.  keep posting and keep us all updated.\\n\\njen\\nHi jennylaine,\\n\\nYour dad has a tough road ahead of him.  There are options such as what he's using at this time, but surgery is also another that he might want to consider if he's had no improvement.  From what I've read and heard, it gives back quality of life.  Yes, there's an adjustment, but I've never heard regret.  Interesting, because that's what I fear for my future...surgery...but it's comforting for me to know that's the consensus out there.\\n\\nMy UC is in the rectum/sigmoid....I've been on Asacol and Salofalk retention enemas (varying scheduling depending on flares and remissions) for over 15 years.  It to me is a miracle med and has controlled my UC well (meaning it hasn't spread farther up the colon).  I tolerate it very well.  As of my last colonoscopy, no cancer...so that's good.  I'm also on Effexor XR for depression...has indirectly helped my UC methinks.\\n\\nRemember also that it takes time for the meds to kick in and the flares to quiet down.  It's not a fast process at all.\\n\\nThere is definitely a correlation between UC and other physical symptoms.  I don't know if fibro is directly related (I thought it may be Herpes related...but I think that of UC as well)...meaning if one's colon was removed whether the symptoms of fibro would still be there.    But, there are many UC and CD sufferers who have severe body aches, arthritis, joint aches, fibro, eye problems, skin problems, liver disease, kidney disease.....etc.\\n\\nI'm sure I've had fibro most of my life, long before UC.  I have asthma as well.  Who knows how it all is connected....they are all autoimmune disorders and quite definitely a struggle to live with all or any.  I have good days, almost no body pain at all, other days I'm dragging my butt and feel as though I've been run over by a truck. Sometimes they correlate with flares, other times not...the weather certainly seems to affect my pain level.   Exercise, stretching, yoga...etc are all good for fibro and UC.   Antidepressants are also an option since they seem to have an effect on the emotional/gut relationship.  Seems to work for some with depression and UC.\\n\\nYou're right that the distal/lower area of UC is more managable because it's the most accessible from oral/rectal meds.  What med is your friend using at this time?\\n\\nI really feel and understand the frustrations you have now knowing your dad is really suffering with his UC.  There are other preparations that people have tried.  Many have used as supplement to meds....prebiotics and probiotics, AMP, acupuncture, SCD (specific carbohydrate diet), whip worm therapy, even take up smoking because there seems to be a connection with UC  (not sure about a nicotine patch)...\\n\\nOther immunomodulating or immunosuppressant meds used are imuran, remicade, 6-MP.  If remicade is used, one has to be tested for TB in the system.\\n\\nHas your dad been checked for clostridium difficile (c. diff)?  Make sure that has been checked as well, it's difficult to treat, but can be at the same time as UC, or confused with UC.  It's treated with antibiotics...interestingly enough it's caused by antibiotics as well.  Talk about a puzzle for sure.\\n\\nI do hope your dad is able to get his symptoms relieved and soon be on the road to recovery.  Your support is definitely important to his well-being, but I believe you already know that or you wouldn't be here.\\n\\nBest to you all,\\nquincy\\nI was just diagnosed with UC today , yep 37 years old and I have a feeling I've had it since my early 20's but doctors kept telling me I'm too young to have stomach probs .Every time I showed concern about blood in my stools they said to increase my fibre intake , which I did , and my symptoms would seemingly go away .\\n\\nEven today , just before the doc started the colonoscopy he said''you know , I bet you its just hemmorroids'' .I said , ''well , I disagreee and I bet we'll soon find out wont we ''\\n\\nSure enough , I'm in his office 30 minutes later and he's telling me I have UC (and like I say , have probably had it since age 22 ish)\\n\\nthey took biopsy as well , so he said to come back and see him when results arrive etc..\\n\\nI dont know what to say to help your fathers situation as I dont think my UC has ever really taken on that serious of a problem just yet .I did however have a 4 week span in which I had alot of blood in stool back in June (which told me to tell my doctor to stop scrweing me around and send me for a colonoscopy)After four weeks of constant blood in stool /irregular bowel movements I started loading up on METAMUCIL 3 times a day and within two or so days my bloody stools started to ease up and go away .\\n\\nHas you father ever tried metamucil + a few fruits (apple,orange) after dinner ?\\nI find it makes a big difference with me as far as keeping myself regular\\n\\nto boot , I have arthritis (severe , bed ridden w-out celebrex) and after doing some research I see that arthritis is a condition many with UC have ...\",\n",

Well now they have given her 5 pints of blood, because she was losing blood in her bowel, she is on so many meds, nothing really helps she is sick everyday. She is 18 years old and now has a tutor, because she is so sick all the time,she cant make it to school. So if you can keep going to the dr. ask many questions and have as much testing as you can get to help pinpoint exactly what is wrong. Dont let the drs. tell you it is nothing, and end up like my niece, losing blood and she said when she eats it is like eating glass,she ahs lost so much weight,still on meds I think for the rest of her life.

See your doctor right away.  You may just have a slight obstruction, or not, either way you do need to see a doctor.  Your symptoms describe many of the things I have gone through, and they are not to be ignored.  The symptom of vomiting up green, that is bile more than likely, so do not let this go on.  Your electrolytes could be severely off, as this is a very common thing that happens to us with crohns.  Any and all of these things really do deserve the attention of a doctor.\\n\\nI know it is frustrating to continually have to seek out your doctor, but that is the best thing with crohns.  It is a tricky, fast moving, fast changing, deceptive, painful, disease....BUT...it IS manageable to a point, and you CAN live a normal, active life.  It takes time, patience, and a lot of trial and error, however.  THat is the nature of the beast, AND of course, everyone IS different, and therefore slightly differently receptive to, or not receptive to, treatment methods.\\n\\nI will say this.  I am a very rare case of the \"sterotypical\" crohns patient.  I am written up in the New England Medical Journal, from back in 1980-something, due to the fact that I have had EVERY immaginable side-effect, and symptom of this disease.  I have had rheumatoid arthritis, I have had five ostomies, I have had my large bowel, rectum, and all but 13 feet of my small bowel removed.  Yes, I only have 13 feet of small bowel remaining, with an ileostomy, and NOTHING below that.  I am not telling you this to frighten you, quite the OPPOSITE.  I am a VERY RARE case.  Medications that typically work for crohns patients have NOT for me.  I am in a slight \"remission\" for the past almost year or so.  I have had kidney failure, due to malabsorption and dehydration (this is DUE to the shortened bowel mostly).  AND I could go on and on.  I also have no gallbladder or appendix.  I have also had many unrelated surgeries as well.  But the crohns is the one thing that NEVER goes away.\\n\\nI recently went to \"grand rounds\" at a local medical center (I was invited), and listened to a doctor from University of Chicago Medical Center.  He is doing VERY successful stem cell replacements(not from embryo\\'s, but from the patient themselves!!!), and it was AMAZING what it has done for the crohns patients that have had it (only three of them have had it, but all three have gone TWO and a HALF YEARS now with NO symptoms of crohns).  This, of course, is a VERY serious procedure, and is not something to be taken lightly, especially the older you are.  These three patients were ages 21; 25 and 34 years of age.  I only mention this because it is my ONLY hope now, as I am that rare type of crohns patient that nothing else has helped.\\n\\nI am sorry to go on and on my dear.  I am so eager to inform and help out ANYONE with crohns, that I tend to get carried away.  However, if you just want a point of view on something to do with crohns, I would be happy any time, to help out here on the healthboards forum, at least with my own experiences that is.\\n\\nTake care, and please get yourself to the doctor, I think you need to.  Dont let yourself go on suffering, PLEASE.\\n\\nGod bless,\\nSuzi\\n\\nHi Suzi,\\nThank You for responding to my post. I am trying so hard to find any help for my niece, I see yo did not mention about losing blood, did you ever have to have transfudions? My niece has had 5 pints of blood in the last 6 months. She is on so many meds. right now I do not know the names, but I know she takes alot. Some days she seems okay, and then others she is so sick. She seems to be worse in the morning, as the day goes by she seems better. A friend of ours has crohns and he said he heard that with in the next year they have a new pill that seems to help with crohns, it has to be approved but he has heard very good things about it. I pray it helps with this horrible nightmare. She worries about having children and having a normal life, what can we say, we dont know what to expect, this is so horrible, and very scary. Well I thank You once again for taking the time to respond and hope all is well with you.        cookie\\nHi Cookie,\\nYup I DID have blood loss.  But, in my case the blood loss was not at ALL like that of your niece.  That is the nature of this beast called crohns.  You see, SOME of us have a LOT of blood loss, some have NONE.  It hits everyone differently, but yet we all have the same disease.  My close friend (whom I actually MET in the hospital) who has crohns, HAS had the extreme blood loss in the past.  However, lucky for her, the doctors discovered it right away.  She had biopsies, and then the true diagnosis of crohns.  Until the biopsy (which by the way, is the ONLY true way to tell whether a patient has crohns, or just IBS or ulcerative colitis, because crohns is the only one of the IBS diseases that effects ALL the layers of the intestinal wall), they thought she had ulcerative colitis.\\nI DO get anemic, but THAT is due to malabsorption of B12/iron.  THe part of my intestinal tract (there is only ONE part of the intestinal tract where B12 is absorbed by the way) that absorbs B12 was inflammed, and therefore could not absorb anything properly.  THEN that part of my intestines was removed.  I was CHRONICALLY anemic.  Now I give myself monthly B12 injections (I was a certified medical assistant for years, so lucky for me, I know how to give injections.  BUT this can be easily taught to anyone by proper training).\\nDoes your niece continue to have bleeding?  Because it really is NOT all that common to have a LOT of bleeding from just the crohns.  I worry that she has some other problem going on.  Are they monitoring her stools?  Is she chronically anemic now?\\nI feel for her.  I admire you for being so conscientious for your niece.  She REALLY needs your support.  Far too many friends and family can NEVER fully understand how much impact this disease has on a person\\'s emotional state.  It is life long, and it effects a person\\'s life deeply.  The MOST important thing in a crohns patient\\'s life is TRUE support, unlimited.  It is a BIG committment.  BUT it can save a person with crohns from very deep depression, feelings of poor self worth, etc..., etc...\\nI have been VERY lucky to have a few TRUE friends, and MOST of my family.  One of which is my mother, the other is my Godmother, who is also my mom\\'s sister, and my aunt, and who is an RN.  This has TRULY saved my life.\\n\\nI HOPE I have helped a bit.  Anything else I can tell you, just ask.  I check here every night, so I would love to help any way I can.\\n\\nGod bless you AND of course, your niece.\\n\\n\\nSUZI\\n\\nHi Suzi, Thank You for your response about my niece. Yes I think support from family and friends is so important at this time. My niece is very frightened by what is going on and we also are confused and trying to learn as much as we can, and try and help her deal with this. My sister also has a son with downs, so she has her hands full, its like trying to deal with so many things at one time. I guess the lord only gives you what you can handle, but sometimes I look at her and think please give her a break. If I come across any information on crohns I will post it right away, I think every bit of information can be helpful, so please if you have any suggestions, we will be glad and grateful to get any advice we can get.\\nThank you       cookie',\n",

You need to treat the person with the disease rather than the disease itself and this is just what modern medicine does not make enough time for, which I feel is extremely sad.\\n\\nIf only doctors would take a little more time with their patients and treat them rather than their specific disease state, it would make so much difference.  The things is, yes, there is UC, however, every single patient with UC that goes into a doctor\\'s office will be displaying a completely different manifestation of this than the next person, which is why giving everyone the same form of treatment just because they have UC is wrong.  The choice of treatment has to fit the person with the disease and not the disease itself.\\n\\nHave you ever considered J-Pouch surgery (or any of the \"Pouch\" surgeries)?  I had it done when I was 18 (I am now 23) and I\\'m quite glad I did.

       " {'post': 'Hi,\\n\\nI am wondering how many of you who have Lupus or know you have Lupus and your doctor just won\\'t diagnose you have suffered with bowel issues.  I had an attack of active ulcerative colitis- which now they say was probably due to vasculitis of the colon- once the ulcers healed I have been left with a horrible problem with irritable bowel.  The last 2 years my symptoms of the Lupus have been active and my bowel in kind has been almost unbearable.  I have attacks at least once a day if not more.  Does any of this sound familiar??  Is there a link someone knows about.  It seems to me that the bowel synptoms started after the joint symptoms, rash, sun issues, fatigue and Sjogrens, but never resolved even though the active ulcers did?  Has anyone taken Zelnorm- with good results.  Just wondering and trying to tie all my ailments together if possible.  I appreciate your feedback.\\nThanks!\\nUlcerative Colitis is thought to be an autoimmune disease.  Often UC people have postive\\nANA\\'s.\\n\\nI\\'m still waiting for a definate SLE diagnosis and yes, I have IBS.  At it\\'s worst I was having attacks up to 16 times a day.  Currently it\\'s just a few times a day so I\\'m thankful.\\n\\nMy best friend has UC, and has had it for over 20 yrs.  She does not have SLE.  She is in a remission right now, she\\'s on some kind of chemotherapy drugs that have been a really big help.\\nI don\\'t have ulcerative colitis, but I do have IBS.  (Endometriosis is growing on my colon....)  My OBGYN told me to take Citrucel every day and it would level out the bowel activity.  Sometimes absolutely nothing would move, no matter I did to get it going, and other times, the activity was relentless and non-stop. The Citrucel really did help get me back on an even keel.  It works by adding bulk when you need it and absorbing excess water when you don\\'t.\\nBeachbound,\\n\\nI saw an interesting article a few weeks back on people \"presenting\" with lupus when they first have an apparent bowel obstruction or problems that look like ulcerative colitis but aren\\'t (after proper testing, of course).\\n\\nI don\\'t know that anyone has PROVEN the correlation in large numbers of lupus patients, but there\\'s apparently enough of this sort of thing seen that this rheumatology journal had a specific article on SLE & it.\\n\\nMy own guess is that YES, the horrible IBS bouts feel related to me.  I\\'ve done the IBS thing for over 25 years now.  It\\'s much less frquent now that I take Plaquenil, avoid sun, am over 50, etc.  I have no idea what factors have played a role in its lessening.  I still get bouts, though, but not as often or lasting as long.\\n\\nWhat you write is very familiar to me.  I watch what I eat, too, as I know some foods drive me over the brink.  It\\'s more than just foods, of course, but I feel I help my odds a bit by avoiding foods that are known personal triggers.\\n\\nSympathetically, Vee\\nI am not yet diagnosed with anything for sure but my ANA was positive and so was my fecal occult for blood in my stool.  I am awaiting more tests.  I do know that my flares seem to coincide, my bowel problems always seem to be present but get really bad around the same times my other problems (which seem like lupus symptoms) do.  I think if I do have lupus that it\\'s been coming for a long time but interestingly enough it was my bowel problems that sent me to the doctor in the first place.  I put the lupus symptoms off thinking it was just \"becoming a mom\".  I don\\'t think that anymore.  I hope you find your answers.  Take care\\nI am also suffering with IBS and have been initially diagnosed with Lupus.  I am currently taking a daily dose of levsinex and it has helped a lot with the diarrhea and constipation. I also read that same article and think that the link does exist between the two\\nI am also suffering with IBS and have been initially diagnosed with Lupus.

I also read that same article and think that the link does exist between the two.\\nCaden/Logan\\'s mom,\\n\\nI was wondering when you developed your bowel and joint symptoms.  Mine all started post partum after early pre-eclampsia.  I began with arthritis and fatigue- then about 3 years later developed the bowel issues and they have never left nor has my arthritis.  That was 9 years ago.  I take Levisin SL and it does help for the acute attacks, but I have to use Donnatal, if I have repeated attacks in one day.  There has to be a connection.  A doctor told me that my episode of ulcerative colitis (visible ulcers in my colon) could be caused from vasculitis. but can irritable bowel be linked to vasculitis?  I am seeing a specialist at a large medical center next month, so I will certainly try to get as much info as possible.  I will update you.\\nBeachbound\\nMy joint pain started with my periods several years ago and was what I thought was endometriosis.  I had surgery and they found no endometriosis however my symptoms (there were several) persisted up until the time I got married.  I saw a doctor again who recommended maybe we try to have babies and we did thinking it would take a while to get pregnant, it took two weeks (not usual of endometriosis).  My bowel problems began in pregnancy not diarrhea but chronic severe constipation which is a normal part of pregnancy right??  Well I used to sit and cry on the toilet because I was so \"full\" and it was like my bowels weren\\'t moving at all.  My constipation was definetely not normal and didn\\'t improve no matter what I did, still won\\'t.  It was not normal but I thought it was.  It was in my postpartum period that the intermittent bouts of diarrhea began but constipation has always been and still is my primary bowel problem.  After my second baby my bowels problems have just escalated plus I began to experience chronic yeast infections which still plague me and are resistant to what used to treat them.  Then once I started having periods again ( I had two babies 16 months apart so I was pregnant/nursing and having no periods for a long time), the joint pain and severe fatigue would occur but I noticed a link because when my bowel problem would flare I also had this pain/fatigue syndrome going on as well.  Fatigue has been a major factor in my life for the past 18 months, since the birth of my last baby but I put it off for a long time as just being a new mom and chasing kids, it\\'s now become a daily challenge to my living my life like I want to.  After now being diagnosed with lupus (still testing but have met four criteria including positive ANA test) my doctor explained to me that it is possible that lupus could be causing my bowel inflammation and may have possibly been what was causing my period problems long ago.  In both my pregnancies I also had pre eclampsia which he said can be related to lupus.  It was interesting to talk with my doctor because I can see a connection between so many things in my medical history in the past five-seven years which could have actually been lupus related.  I am also having a colonoscopy on the 25th to see if I have ulcerative colitis or what, I am nervous for the test but anxious to find the results.  Thank you for your info, sorry for the novel!  Take care.\\nMy severe IBS started half a lifetime ago, fifteen years before a full-blown lupus rash; and it was so bad that I was hospitalized several times just for it.  It was not pregnancy-related.  Now I suspect vasculitis---but had never even heard of the word at that time.\\n\\nMy mom suffered, too, and my sister does, to a lesser degree.\\n\\nCaden/Logan_mom, like you, I look back at my long & varied medical history and wonder how much may have been lupus...  Just no way to tell for sure, I guess.  I had several bouts of high fevers & convulsions as a 4-year old, and spent weeks in children\\'s hospitals way back then.  Bullous rashes in the 4th grade.  Bizarro periods & prolonged arthritic pain with fever and strange WBC as a teen.  Something new every decade, in other words.\\n\\nAnyway, good luck with the colonoscopy.  I think they pretty much knock you out today, which may be preferable to the good old days.  No one wants this test---but I found worrying about it was far worse than the test itself---and I was fully awake!  If I can do it, anyone can, is my theory.\\n\\n\\nHang in there everyone.  Vee\\nThanks vee!  I know i asked the nurse and she said that even thought they don\\'t knock you totally out that nobody remembers anything so I thought, good enough for me.  I think to myself when I read these posts no wonder they can\\'t find a cure or aren\\'t sure why lupus happens because everybody\\'s symptoms, history, and experience are so varied.  Good luck to all!  Have a happy day!\\nBy the way I will say that before I even thought about lupus and was just concentrating on my bowel problems, my flares of bowel trouble and then the lupus symptoms I was trying not to pay attention to always hit at the same time or within very close proximity to one another.\\nHi, I\\'m new here, but have had what I call a spastic colon ever since the birth of my first child, who is now 15.  I found out by accident that aspirin completely eliminates the symptoms.  It doesn\\'t cure it, but I haven\\'t had that seizing pain in the rectum/sigmoid for 5 years now (with subsequent constipation, of course).  I take one baby aspirin a day, and if I eat a lot of salad or am under a lot of stress, may take two for a couple days.  If I forget to take it for several days, I can feel it coming back on, so I know it\\'s still lurking there.\\n\\nDon\\'t know if that would work for anyone else...my MD\\'s had never heard of such a thing, but it\\'s been a lifesaver for me, a very simple solution without the nasty side effects of those other meds.\\n\\nOh, also forgot to say, I started out taking several baby ASA a day, like 3 in the morning and 2 at night, and then weaned down to what now controls it.  I\\'m not sure if that higher dosage was needed to get it under control at the beginning, and I\\'m not about to go back and experiment to find out!\\nDiane,\\n\\nIt\\'s Vee again (I posted to you in another thread).  I also had \"spastic colon\"  for over 1/2 my life, enough to be hospitalized for it alone several times.  Full tests (colonoscopies, etc). always negative for ulcerative colitis, Crohn\\'s, etc.  Bouts were accompanied by weight loss, elevated ESR, huge headaches, low-grade fever, pain in joints & along long bones (esp. shins), etc.\\n\\nThen it was concluded that problem was \"only\" fibromyalgia.  But then came the rashes.  Then, finally, Dx of SCLE, cutaneous vasculitis (and watched for anything worse), and also being watched for APS.  I\\'m on Plaqeunil now.\\n\\nDon\\'t you just HATE the GI stuff?  Talk about a show-stopper!  You said you are small-built.  So am I, and I\\'d lose add\\'l weight from bad bouts.  I ended up with early menopause, osteoporosis, etc.\\n\\nHmmm.  One really wonders about the possibility of some single, overall condition being the underlying cause.  I don\\'t know that there *has* to be a single cause, by the way.  FYI, I still have minor bouts but not nearly so bad as before.     Hang in there!  Vee   P.S.  There are others on this Board who have discussed persistent IBS-type problems.\\nVee--would you believe that I have osteoporosis too, dx\\'d at age 38??  I\\'ve dismissed it as unrelated to any of my lupus-like symptoms of the past year or two, because I\\'m almost 42 now and I think you have to have lupus for several years for it to cause osteoporosis.  Even my earliest sx, the malar rash (if it is that) isn\\'t more than 2 years old, I don\\'t think.  I\\'ve been on Actonel for almost 4 years now, and I\\'d been to an MD who was trying to find a cause for such premature bone loss, and never found one.  She thought it surely had to be parathyroid related, but the tests just never showed that.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t for lack of calcium.  I love milk, used to drink it like most kids drink pop when I was a younger.',\n",

       " {'post': \"Hello everyone,\\nI was just wondering if anyone else has a problem with fistulas with their crohns and what meds that you are taking? I am going on 23 with having said i have crohns for almost 1 year. please help with some info.thanks\\nI also have crohns disease.  I've had 1 fistula because of it about 5 years ago.  I've had bowel problems most of my life but wasn't diagnosed until 3 years ago and I am now 40.  The only med I'm currently on for it is asacol.  There aren't too many on this board with crohns or UC but there are a couple so hopefully you'll get more responses.  I take it you're having fistula problems right now??  When I had mine I had to have a temporary colostomy done so it could heal and then I had it reversed.  Good luck with everything.\\nthanks for replying.  Yes I have a bad problem with fistulas. they will not close. they really dont want to any surgery becouse i am so young (23).  So i guess i will just deal with it. thanks again\\nWhat meds have they got you on?\\nRight now i am on asacol and augmentin xr. the augmentin is suppose to clear up the fistulas but no luck yet. I have been on some type of antibotic for probably close to 2 years. but i have only been on the augmentin for about 6 months. they said that sometime it takes awhile to clear things up. this is kinda gross but they said i have a hole in my rectum that it draining through the fistula out the sides my vagina. Sometimes when i pass gas i can feel it releasing through these spots. did you have this problem?\\nI had what they called a colo-vaginal fistula.  I think its similar to what you have right now.  Feces and what not drained from my colon through my vagina.  I ended up with septicemia, massive infection and came pretty darn close to dying.  I have a friend that has trouble with fistulas not closing also.  They finally gave her remicade and it worked wonderfully for her.  Is this maybe an option for you?  I know it is very expensive so unfortunately not an option for many people.  Have they mentioned surgery at all?  With mine they did a temporary colostomy so it could heal and after about 4 months they went back in and reversed it.  I was so full of infection they couldn't locate exactly where the fistula was but they did know the general area.  Are you on acidophilus (sp??) or something similar to combat losing all the good flora bacteria from being on the antibiotics?  Two years is a long time on an antibiotic.  Do you see a GI doc?\\nI have thought about the remicade but my GI told me with the drug being so new that they could not tell me the effects it would have if i wanted to get pregnant or while i was pregnant. I dont see kids in my near future but i dont want to start something that could keep me from having kids. i am really looking forward to having kids. He said that the asacol can be taken durning pregnancy. So right now that is my choice. they would like me to try remicade but i am uncofortable with it, not knowing. my surgeon said that unless i started to have really big problems he didnt want to do anything becouse of how young i am. he is afraid of messing up my bowel control.\\nI would want to wait too then if I were in your shoes.  My friend that went on the remicade had one child and couldn't have any more so that was never an issue for her.  Have they given you any indication as to when you could expect the fistula to have healed by?\\nThe last time I went to the doc he said that sometimes the antibotics can take up to a year to clear up. I have to say that if I miss a dose of the antibotic they will get bigger and be uncomfortable the next day or two. My problem is that my ex knew about the problem and knew that i had some bumps down there. but now that i am single i worry about future sex partners wondering and even being scared of them. I have been single now for about 6 months and really dont know if i will be comfortable to get intimate with someone. I dont know if the granulmas(spelling) can be removed again or not. I go back to my ob/gyn in april and my GI in May and i plan on asking both of them about it.  I have a ? for you. My last 2 yearly paps have came back abnormal and I have never had a problem before but since i have had the fistulas they have been abnormal. Have you had this problem? Last year they did the whole pinch a piece of my cervix and check it under a microscope and said that there were no abnormal cells but this year it came back abnormal again. my GI said that sometimes ob/gyns have a problem with Crohns. Just wondering if you have had the same problem. Thanks for all the help.\\nActually before my crohns diagnosis I had 2 pap tests come back abnormal.  One I had lazer surgery for and the 2nd one was cryo surgery.  These were probably a good 5-10 years before the fistula.  Interesting though.\",\n",

       " {'post': '\\n\\nHi SuperMichele,\\n\\nJust one clarification.  It\\'s Crohn\\'s Colitis.  It means Crohn\\'s disease in the colon. (not Crohn\\'s/Colitis which would mean both or either)\\n\\nI\\'m concerned with one statement you said.. \"I believe that he can overcome this problem\".  It\\'s not a problem.  It\\'s a disease he will have for the rest of his life.\\n\\nThe disease attacks the entire wall of the intestine, from the inside to the outside.  ALL of it.  It can be anywhere from the mouth to the anus.  It can be in one place as well as another.  Surgery will not cure the disease.  A person who has Crohn\\'s will also have other physical manifestations.  It can affect the eyes, joints, muscles, liver, kidneys.  A person with Crohn\\'s disease can have severe intestinal blockages where emergency surgery is necessary.  The possibility that your friend may have to have his colon removed is a distinct possibility.  Crohn\\'s disease can cause abscesses and then eventually fistulas.  Those are basically tunnels from organ to organ.  So, imagine a disease that just burrows holes in the body.\\n\\nMedications for a person with Crohn\\'s disease can also have serious side effects.  Some cause allergic reactions.  Some medications may work, others may not.\\n\\nIt takes many years for a person with Crohn\\'s disease to get to know the reality of it -- a hell disease, and I truly feel for him.\\n\\nSo, it\\'s not a problem.  Overcoming it isn\\'t a priority in one\\'s life as is learning to accept and live WITH it.  And, that can take a while.\\n\\nOK, soapbox put away.\\n\\nYou\\'re a wonderful friend who has extended your heart to someone who has something potentially debilitating.   If you want to know what to do, educate yourself about Crohn\\'s disease.\\n\\nYour friend may misunderstand your intent on being there for him.  Sometimes, it\\'s just difficult to have friends, because dealing with oneself takes up a lot of time --- and it\\'s just easier at times to not have to explain what\\'s wrong.  There are many fears, there is much pain, and talking about bowel movements, pain, gas, diarrhea, constipation....isn\\'t something that everyone wants to hear.  Some people CAN\\'t talk about their disease.  He may not be able to relay his feelings about the whole thing, or he just doesn\\'t care to talk about it and it\\'s not important to him.\\n\\n\\nBathrooms are almost always on the mind of one with CD.  He will possibly be fussy with foods -- not eating many.\\n\\nYour friend will have to find the balance.  That means to have friends who understand, friends who just listen, friends who can just be normal....etc.\\n\\nWords of encouragement can definitely be taken the wrong way.  Ask how he\\'s doing, ask what meds the docs have him on, ask him how he\\'s feeling....etc.  You could also openly ask him what he would like from you as a friend.\\n\\nJust be you, and be understanding, and know that if he says he\\'s not feeling well, he probably isn\\'t.\\n\\nIf you are true in your intent, it will work as any relationship.  It grows, has ups and downs, continues or doesn\\'t.  Try not to have too many expectations.\\n\\nYour friend will be going through tough times, and you as his friend sometimes takes the brunt of emotional relief.  You are a person with feelings as well.  Just because dealing with chronic disease is difficult, it doesn\\'t allow one to be rude or disrespectful.  But, there will definitely be moments.\\n\\nIt\\'s tough having a relationship with no health problems involved.  It\\'s tougher when that can sometimes when health is a primary focus.\\n\\nI wish you both the best, and that your friend is able to get his CD stablised and out of the hospital soon.\\n\\nquincy\\n\\nYeah I know that he can\\'t just get rid of it..I was kind of meaning get over it mentally and live life like a normal 17 yr old, just with a few minor adjustments. Sorry for the misunderstanding.\\n\\nI\\'m trying to learn as much as i can about this diease, but there is so much info to take in. I will keep researching. Hopefully I can talk with him about this and he\\'ll probably notice that I\\'m trying my best, but at times it\\'s hard to comprehend EVERYTHING!\\n\\n{I think that my friend has a calstomy(spelling?) bag, so i don\\'t think that he has to worry about the bathroom as much}\\n\\nThanks Quincy!! You helped me a bunch!!!\\n\\nHey Quincy and supermichelle!  Quincy, first of all, I\\'d like to say that was a wonderful post, but wow, you really made Crohn\\'s seem horrible.  Do you have a really bad case of it?  I mean, it CAN be horrible, but most cases don\\'t have to be.  Many cases of Crohn\\'s, in fact, can be bad for a few weeks, but then go in to remission for many months to years.  You are right though, many people learn to live with it and deal with the relapses.\\n\\nA couple of things I wanted to add (I hope you don\\'t mind quincy).  I am not a fan of calling the disease \"Crohn\\'s colitis\" because you get mixed up with the names.  Crohn\\'s disease along with ulcerative colitis, are two separate (and totally different) diseases which make up the entity known as inflammatory bowel disease (NOT to be confused with irritable bowel syndrome).\\n\\nCrohn\\'s as quincy said can involve any part of the GI tract from the gum to the bum.  Though most cases involve the small bowel in some way (usually the terminal ileum).  Crohn\\'s has a patchy look to it when you look at it through a colonoscope, and it involves inflammation through the entire thickness of the bowel wall (again, like quincy said).\\n\\nUlcerative colitis is a little bit different.  It usually ONLY involves the large bowel.  It always involves the rectum and in different patients, continues upstream to various degrees.  Ulcerative colitis only involves the most superficial layers of the bowel wall.\\nHi butterflytrans,\\n\\nNo, I have ulcerative colitis....limited to the distal part (rectum/sigmoid). A mild case controlled by 5ASA meds.  I have a great doctor and have had it for almost 18 years, but diagnosed 15+ years ago.\\n\\nNow, why would I mind clarification.....you\\'re an equal member of this board and I certainly don\\'t know everything ;-)  Clarify away.\\n\\nCrohn\\'s in the colon IS called Crohn\\'s colitis.  I understand that term clearly, but many people think it can be Crohn\\'s with ulcerative colitis.  But, I do understand why you\\'d be averse to the term.\\n\\nOne cannot have both at the same time (as clarified and confirmed by my doctor).....contrary to what people may believe.  The term colitis is loose....but Crohn\\'s colitis is definitely in the bowel.  Not all the bowel, but in the bowel.  One can also have Ileitis, and Crohn\\'s colitis at the same time...etc.\\n\\nWith ulcerative colitis, one can have backwash ileitis....that\\'s where it\\'s just into the ileum from the \"backwash\" from cecum involvement at the opening of the appendix.  One with ulcerative colitis can also have severe rectal involvement as well as cecum involvement with all the rest of the colon clear.  But, it ALWAYS starts at the anus and isn\\'t patchy throughout the colon as you stated.\\n\\nCrohn\\'s can also have severe anal/rectal involvement and is much times confused with ulcerative colitis.  When the fistulas start showing up....it\\'s definitely crohn\\'s.  (I have a friend with this and it\\'s hell for her....but she\\'s handling it very well -- I\\'m in awe!)  I never knew this until her experience.\\n\\nUC and CD are two different diseases for sure.....but there are some that believe otherwise (small following).  Methinks it\\'s because the beginning stages of CD in the colon looks like and acts like UC.  In any event, the first prescribed meds (usually 5ASA) for both would work in treating the inflammation.\\n\\nDo you have UC or CD?  Where is yours and what meds are you on?  How are you doing at this time?\\n\\nThanks for the input.....any that is valid always is helpful and NECESSARY it seems.\\n\\nTalk soon,\\nquincy\\n\\n\\nPlease take my bluntness in stride....it\\'s not meant to be rude, just educational.\\n\\n\\nMinor adjustments??  I don\\'t think so....Learning to live with a colostomy (a bag that your stool is stored into) would be difficult especially at first.  As a matter of fact it\\'s my biggest fear (I have UC).  As well, there may be future surgeries which would be possible so that the bag is in the body instead of out of it.  Both have to be emptied, cleaned meticulously so that infection doesn\\'t set in....etc.  It\\'s a different way of life and would definitely take more than just a minor adjustment.\\n\\nHow do you feel when you get our period?  Do you have to change pads, tampons, isn\\'t it a pain to have to deal with that once a day?  In comparison.....imagine having to deal with poop, not blood on something that can just be discarded and another one attached or inserted and away you go. With the bags, they would have to be emptied many times a day.   I understand they\\'re also noisy....something else to be a reminder and possibly something to hide.\\n\\nHe\\'s not a normal 17 year old. His body is changed and functions differently now.   There will be many issues that he will have to face, intimacy being one of them. But, this has happened to him when he\\'s young, and life goes on.\\n\\nYou\\'re still on the right track tho, but find out what surgery he had to have done.  Read up about colostomy (removal of the colon and replaced by an external bag), and the various Crohn\\'s surgeries. That can open the door to discussion and questions to him....at least if he uses terminology, you\\'ll understand it.  There are complications at times, but it\\'s not necessarily the norm.  One has to recuperate after surgery and that does take time.\\n\\nMeds will still be required.   You can find out about that as well.\\n\\nRemember, you\\'re not living with it....and YOU\\'RE overwhelmed by the info.  keep it all in perspective for you won\\'t learn it all in a short period of time.  It\\'s understandable for sure.\\n\\nIt all takes time, just go along with the process and just deal with each day as it comes.  It\\'s not a straight forward disease.  Let your friend set the pace.  Intake of info from any avenue varies with everyone.\\n\\nYou seem like a great friend and with good friends, the ups and downs of recovery can be smoother.\\n\\nMaybe through this....you\\'ll pursue a career in the medical field??  ;-)\\n\\nI wish you the best,\\nquincy\\nSmall note....UC always involves the rectum, not the anus.  Anal involvement with UC obviously exists, but as you have said earlier, that is more common with CD.  Seeing patients having to deal with fistulas and fissures is quite eye-opening as you come to the realization they have to live with it every day.  I\\'ve also seen a few cases of perianal sepsis eventually leading to severe fistula formation...not fun....especially after the infection has cleared up and their fistulae are treated with the cutting setons.  Again....not fun.\\n\\nQuincy, do you have any extraintestinal symptoms of UC?  Any problems with sclerosing cholangitis?\\n\\nHi,  What you say is true....but UC does start at the anus (internal).    Maybe there\\'s inflammation there, but not active disease... (haven\\'t done any searching about that part....but it\\'s stated that it starts at the anus, not at the rectum). Definitely not active disease as in CD which is external anus as well.  Maybe talking about anal involvement means external???\\nInteresting....maybe just perspective.\\n\\nBut, those with a colectomy (UC only)....if the anus hasn\\'t been removed, for some there is still disease involvement and eventually an analectomy has to be done.  So, it still involves the anus.\\n\\nInteresting you mentioned PSC.....it\\'s been suspect because of my increased liver enzymes 7 or so  years ago.  That was a ride for sure.  I didn\\'t have the internet at that time, and a friend printed about a 2 inch stack of info.  As I hilighted it I basically cried for 2 weeks.  One piece of info helped alleviate my distress....a doctor was against the ERCP as a test tool, stating the incidence of pancreatitis and triggering PSC in people who only may have had the potential for it to happen maybe many years down the road was way too high, so it should only be done in people where other symptoms where almost positive that PSC was active.\\n\\nSo, I nixed the ERCP and my doctors agreed.  So far, my enzymes are steady at the elevated level.....so unless they start to increase, it\\'s not a concern.  The specialist said that the fact that I\\'m female would be a probability that I don\\'t have it anyway....   What are statistics anyway, I\\'ve never been one that fits in with statistics....\\n\\nMy sister has 3 ERCPs done for gallbladder disease and now had pancreatitis.  I wasn\\'t willing to risk the probablility of getting that as well.\\n\\nOther manifestations are body pain, slight eye problems, some mouth cankers that come and go.  Nothing severely problematic or OBVIOUS....but I\\'ve had many little things forever...so who knows.  My dad had ankylosing spondylitis..there\\'s a connection for sure.  I also have asthma (inherited from my mom\\'s side of the family)...but there are many who seem to have both UC and asthma..so who really knows.\\n\\nHow about you?  Do you have UC or CD, and what other connected manifestations to you have?\\n\\nHow long?, what meds,  etc?\\n\\nThanks,\\nquincy\\n\\nTell him to discuss intravenous Remacaid (Remacade) w/ his docs.  DH had Crohn\\'s for a couple of years, was on prednisone and some other drug, did the dietary restrictions and all, finally had a massive bleed-out and got one treatment of IV Remacaid and his Crohn\\'s is *GONE*!  It IS curable, no lie.\\nHey quincy...I don\\'t have either....I just know a lot about the subject because of what I do.\\n\\nSkyspinner, remicaide is often a good treatment, but it doesn\\'t cure the disease.  It just puts it in to remission.  The tendency for bowel inflammation is still there, and if you trigger it again, it\\'ll come right back.  Plus, remicaide is very expensive and it can have a lot of side-effects....especially allergic stuff and anaphylactic shock.\\n\\nRemicaide is a good solution for people who have failed other treatments, but it is by no means a panacea.\\nAh, how so? You work for a GI?  First hand info for sure!!\\n\\nI have the best one in the world ;-)....I hope he never retires.  Of course, that\\'s mighty selfish of me, isn\\'t it...but I\\'ve received such good treatment and his philosophy of treatment definitely suited me, and for that, I\\'m grateful!\\n\\n\\nI had one instance where I had to see another doc in the same clinic because my doc had an emergency.  That doc told me bluntly that if I were his patient, he would have had me on prednisone immediately.  I was shocked and said that I was relieved he wasn\\'t my doctor.  I shudder to think how I\\'d have been if that was the first line of treatment -- not so for where mine is.  5ASA rocks for sure!\\n\\nYour input is definitely invaluable on the boards, thanks for the input.\\n\\nBest to you,\\nquincy\\n\\nNo.....it\\'s a *treatment*.\\nHi, Had to voice my opinion on Crohn\\'s, my niece 18 years has just been told she has crohns and she needed 5 pints of blood, due to blood lose, she is on meds. now, we thought she was never going to feel better, but she has had many good days where she can function and even spend time with her friends, which she was too sick to do before. It takes time for meds. to start to help, not cure it but help people with it make it thro the day. We pray that with all the testing that they will find a cure, but in the mean time we have to support her, knowing everyday can chage how she functions, but she has bad days, but for every good day we feel blessed. She also takes alot of imodium, I dont know if it is the right thing to do, but if she feels better taking we dont say anything. Also being stressed is very bad for crohns, try to talk to your friend and express your conserns for his health, and how important it is to stick by him and try to keep his stress level as low as possible. He will be our prayers and I like you pray for a cure for crohns in our life time.\\nbest of luck       Cookie\\nhi,im dennis i had crohns for 10 years.been to all the doctors,they tell me the same thing but nothing helps.i lose 22lbs,so sick i cant even drive a car.after i did get over it some what,i found a that colonics and enemas was the only thing that would help me.a lot of people thinks its crazy for doing colonics and enemas.i did to at frist,but i tried everything that the doctors said and it wasnt working,so why not.im gald i did,i havnt felt so good in many years.i dont know now bad hes got it,but i had it pretty bad only thing that i know that could help.\\nHi Dennis,\\nJust read your post and am wondering if you ever lost blood? My niece loses blood to the point she needs transfusions. She has been doing fairly good the last couple of weeks,but the other day she had blood again. I have read many post about crohns, and do not see anyone write about losing blood, so I am confused, do people with crohns lose blood or is it unusual for that to happen. Any reply would be welcomed.\\nThanks for any help     Cookie',\n",

After I\\'m 18, I could very well not have anymore insurance, but even if they do extend it, it will only be until I\\'m 19.\\n\\nIf any of you know about Crohns disease, you may know that it is a nice costly thing to have. I get Remicade infusions aprox every 8 to 10 weeks. (From what I have been told, they cost $20,000 each time.) Even if I do get put on my Mom\\'s insurance it only covers 80% of that.

As a member of the news media, I write about drug companies, so I have some background in this. The cost of Remicade is more like $20,000 a year (or $4,000 a year for you out of pocket if you\\'re covered 80% by insurance). It\\'s not $20,000 per treatment. This is still a lot of money, I understand. I hope you can get insurance through your college.\\nThanks for your input danimal15, I completely did not know that!

No, I'm not a doc but I did ask my gastroenterologist for clarity and it was a firm NO.  Plus, there's no research listed that one has one plus the other.  But, what seems to be listed is that the testing cannot clarify when CD in early stages follows the disease path (starting at anus/rectum) of UC.\\n\\nAs well, the term colitis just means inflammation in the colon, methinks you might have misunderstood a term.  But, if you have CD in the colon, it's colitis for sure, but not ulcerative colitis.  It's term is Crohn's Colitis.\\n\\nHow unfortunate that your dad is doing poorly, and yes meds can sometimes cause side effects developing into separate diseases worse than the illness itself.  Especially if other organs are affected by either the CD or the medications.\\n\\nHerbs are still medications in my mind.....and if you're getting implanted meds in the colon...is that going to affect the whole colon?  Where exactly in the colon is your CD?\\n\\nCD can happen anywhere from mouth to anus....I fail to see how colonics and herbal enemas can stop it from cropping up elsewhere.   There is no known cure for CD....\\n\\nRegardless of how I perceive those types of treatments, I do hope you feel better.\\n\\nRegards,\\nquincy\\nI have it in the upper and mid colon,and in my rectum.i have a lot of flares up in my rectum even with colonics and enemas,but they are not as bad with the colonics and enemas.\\nMaybe you are right,i might have misunderstood the doctor.but i know he said both names crohns and colitis.And it seem like he was telling me that how it all works together.\\nAm not saying this is a cure,but that i havnt been sick after i started colonics and enemas,and its been one year this month.Am not sure how its going to affect the colon,but one thing is sure that i do know is am a lot better and feel good.And its been years that i felt this good.\\nYou might not understand how it works,u might not have crohns ,you might not had the sickness others had with crohns.But has helped me a lot,and it would have to help others with crothns and or colitis.I mean i cant be the only one this is going to help.\\nAnyone out there that has crohns or and colitis try it for a few months,thats all am saying.\\nHi,\\n\\n\\nAnd anyone who would want to try colonics would have you available to ask.  That's what's great about these boards.\\n\\nI don't have CD, I have UC limited to rectum/sigmoid....diagnosed 16 years ago.\\nI use Asacol and Salofalk retention enemas (same as Rowasa in the US) increased during flares and then tapered to a maintenance of once a week or so.\\n\\nI can eat almost anything I want, make sure MOST of it is healthy and so far bms are happening normally, flares are quickly dealt with, and so far my UC hasn't spread (as a matter of fact it's never been as bad as it was when I was first diagnosed).\\n\\nWhen everything goes awry, I'll at least remember the colonics as one of possible options!\\n\\nKeep well,\\nquincy\\nThe way colonics and enemas work from what am told that they keep the the bowel fushed out from infection that builds up it the bowel,in the ones that have crohns and colitis.which keeps you from getting sick as often,and flare ups.It made sense to me so I had nothing to lose so i tried it for a couple months,gald I did.\\nI was on rowasa enemas also for many months and they worked well for me also.But I stopped taking them to see what would happen,becuase i was on the colonic and enema program.And I did change at all ,no sickness.I keep up on the program am on now,so far so good.\\nThe only thing,my bowel movements are not normal,after i got anything from running through me that I did eat,i have bad trouble with conspation.thats where the enemas come in to help clean me out.And with conspation the flare ups in my rectum is bad.So am bad and forth with colonics to fush out my bowels and enemas for fushing and conspation.I will soon starting enema implants with herbs,my doctor that does these said that they have good results with crohns.\\nEven that I have trouble with the conspation,thats ok i can deal with that,long as am not sick,cant deal with that.I had my food running through me for over 10 years,and run to the bath room 8 to 10 times a day.My life is much better now,I can deal with it.\\nI also have crohns.   I can't see how the enemas would help everyone with it, depending where in the colon the crohns is located.  Enemas only go so far into the colon.  The worst place mine is active at is where the large and the small colon meet and no enema is going to reach that far.  i've never tried the colonics that does sound interesting.  I will check into that I think.  My doctor also told me to limit how many enemas I use because the bowel can become used to them.  Good luck and I hope things continue working for you.\\nhi twisten,am not sure enemas would help everyone,but i believe they could help others.yours is pretty far up there,but am sure a good colonic would.enemas help me fush out and conspation.My doctor that your bowels already mess up so enemas cant hurt you that bad,that they help keep the bowel clean.And that keeps infection out and that helps from getting sick.\\nI been to a lot of different doctors,i even had one doctor told me that its not possible to get crohns in your rectum.Well i found out real quick thats not true.I have it in my rectum,you be surprise that some doctors know little about crohns.\\nI have found out the trick to staying well it to keep my colon cleaned out,i dont care if i have to do enemas every night,long as i dont get sick.\\nhow long have you had crohns,twisten? And what do you do to control it?\\nHave had it for about 18 years now,and sure had a hard time with it,until the last year.\\nAm 49 now,hope you try the colonics out,just have to find someone that does them thats the hard part,but if you live in a big city shouldnt have any trouble.Am in louisville,ky and only two people here that does them.good luck\\nI'm near a small city in Alberta Canada so I doubt if we have any here that do colon cleansing but I'll check.  I've only been diagnosed for 3-4 years.  Usually when I have a bad flare I go on IV fluids, IV steroids, imuran and asacol.  I totally agree that lots of docs know nothing about cd or uc.  I have one like that right now!!  At least she will work with me though not like some that are set in their own ways.  Good luck with everything.  I'll let you know if I find anyone near me who does the colon cleansing.\",\n",

       " {'post': \"Hello All! To start everything off I have Crohn's disease. I got diagnosed about a year ago. I really didnt have many problems. They diagnosed me after a colonoscope. I just recently started to have really bad stomach cramping, it was to the point of being doubled over in pain. I went to the DR and he gave me a stomach relaxer. That helped a lot. Well now my legs are starting to cramp up a lot, my hips are hurting and my elbows hurt a lot. Today I was scratching my arm and found this little spot right above my elbow that is about the size of a pea. It is mostly white (like dry skin) with a red ring around it. My hands are extremly dry. To the point of cracking and bleeding and the skin has changed colors to almost a redish-brown. Between my fingers it is dry and broken up. My hands are so bad that they hurt a lot. I have slept with many different types of lotion on them and even tried an antibotic ointment on them. They have not gotten any better. I am wondering now that I have found this other spot if it is not psoriasis? I am wondering if there is any one else that has Crohn's that has this problem? Is this part of the Crohn's? Any infomation would help? Thanks in advance.\\n\\nRottlover\\nHello... there is a link between auto-immune disorders such as Chrons and skin disorders like psoriasis.. It sounds like eczema, thats just my guess, although I don't believe there is a cure, it is very treatable.  I would take your concerns to a dermatologist, and until then you can try over-the-counter remedies, like Cortizone-10(cortisteroid lotions/creams), antihistamines (which help stop the itching), and even evening primose oil...\\n\\nYou could try tanning too and see if that helps at all.\",\n",

I will go back to bed but have to get up a short time later to go again, but it has progressed to watery diarrhea.  I will also shake uncontrollably, like the chills but no fever present.

I feel ok the next day, other than tired.\\n\\nThe other night this happened but when I was having the bm I thought I was going to pass out.  I didn\\'t feel nauseous or in pain at the time.  I took Imodium right away to stop the diarrhea.\\n\\nAlso, 2 weeks ago I had a bout of daytime watery diarrhea.  It caused bad external hemorrhoids that bled.

       " {'post': 'My husband has been suffering badly for a year... miserably for six months... he can\\'t function, even on Azacol and Prilosec (although they are at least keeping him from lying in bed in the fetal position).  One surgeon couldn\\'t conclude any diagnosis, and said that sometimes removal of the appendix will mysteriously \"cure\\' the patient.  He did remove the appendix and release an adhesion, which we had hoped was the problem, but since that surgery, the symptoms are MUCH worse.\\n\\nSymptoms:\\n* Upper to mid-right quadrant abdominal pain\\n* Diarrhea every time he eats (it was constant prior to starting Azacol and Prilosec... he had to keep a bucket with him in his vehicle!)\\n* Sometimes he complains of an acid feeling in his stomach\\n* Fatigue\\n* Joint pain\\n* Swollen armpits (one doc thought this was from bacteria, but we feel strongly that it\\'s lymph nodes.\\n* Weight GAIN (from this problem directly?  or maybe just from being so inactive because of the fatigue?)\\n* Depression\\n\\nWhen I look back, I would wager to say that he had early symptoms as far back as 8 years ago.  His gall bladder was removed about 3-1/2 years ago.\\n\\nThe internal disease specialist just did an abdominal CT scan, and found a lesion on the liver and \"prominent\" lymph nodes.  They have an MRI scheduled, additional bloodwork (to see if something shows up regarding the liver), and also scheduled a colonoscopy (although he had one a year ago that showed nothing).\\n\\nAnyone have a thought on this?  I\\'m all ears!\\n\\nThank you for taking time to read my post.\\nIm just looking through some posts and i came across yours. I feel very sorry for the both of you. I am going through a similar problem, it has ruined my life for the past year, and because of it im now a \"nutcase\" of panic disorder and depression.\\nSo i can surely relate. ive gotten so i cant even do more testing due to the panic and depression.\\nHe has diarhea immediately after eating? And yet he has gained weight? His colonscopy was clean yet he is taking asacol? You said the two meds help, but i wonder how he would be without the asacol. Maybe its the other that is helping.\\nAsacol is a strong aspirin related medication. One of its biggest side effects is actually causing colitis. If you are sensitive to aspirin, it would also cause many effects similar to an allergic reaction, which could include joint pain, swollen glands etc.\\nIm not saying this is the case, but if you havent tried the stomach med alone, it might be worth a try. The only other thing that comes to mind is that much of it sounds like an infection of some kind. Im sure he was tested, but that can be hard to narrow down.\\nI sincerely wish you and your husband the best. I too am a husband, ive lost my business to a similar condition, lost my mind, and almost lost my family. I know how it feels to try to sleep feeling this bad, and the thoughts that run through your mind.\\nMay God help and heal you both.\\nAsacol is used in ulcerative colitis to treat inflammation in the large intestine. Asacol is one form of mesalamine - other forms include Pentasa and Rowasa.\\n\\nAsacol is used as a maintenance drug - it is helpful in retaining a remission but not in supressing a flare-up. It is typically, but not always, used for ulcerative colitis and ulcerative proctitis and also crohns. It is a anti inflammatory med.\\n\\njust wondering why the doctor prescribe this med? usually its only given if one is found to have crohns or colitis.\\nHe could have an intestinal blockage, maybe from the enlarged lymph nodes obstructing the bowel.  Weight gain can happen with this because not much is moving through the GI tract.  Diarrhea (and abdominal pain) are typical of intestinal obstructions.\\n\\nOr, the liver \"lesion\" (whatever that means ... one of those nonspecific terms doctors like to use) could be significant.  A lot of liver diseases cause an accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity, which can then cause pain, weight gain, and digestive disturbances.\\n\\nHas he had any abnormal bloodwork results so far?',\n",

       " {'post': \"I know you guys are not doctors, my follow up with the GI doc on this is May 12th.  I guess I am just a bundle of nerves, trying to find out before then what's going on and if I'm going to need drugs or what.  Ok, here goes:\\nA.  Ileum Biopsy:  Small Bowel Mucosa with benign lymphoid aggregates\\nB.  Ascending colon mucosa biopsy:\\nColonic mucosa with lymphoid aggregates and mild acute colitis. (see comment)\\nC.  Sigmoid Biopsy:  Colonic Mucosa without diagnostic abnormality.\\nComment:  The biopsy from the ascending colon shows the presence of an acute colitis.  The mucosal architecture is distorted with glandular atrophy, branching and shortening.  A crypt abscess is identified and there is focal acute cryptitis.  The lamina propria is expanded by a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils.  In addition, there are prominent lymphoid aggregates.  Granulomas are not identified.  In view of the architectural abnormalities, the histological appearances are suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease.  As the sigmoid biopsy is within normal limits, the possibility of Crohn's disease should be considered.\\nMy symptoms are diaherra lasting for one day, usually occuring about once every three weeks.  Some of the times I have seen a little bloody mucous.  Other times no.  One other thing to note is that after the doc did the colonoscopy he said everything looked good.  He found a little irritated part of the colon but it didn't look like anything to be concerned about.  Found a benign polyp and found a hemmroid (that is where I thought that the occasional blood was coming from).  My question is basically where will I go from here?  If this is Crohn's will I have to go on medication for the rest of my life?  I have no really life altering symptoms of anything now, I am normal with normal bowel movements.  I may come up with diaherra tomorrow but in the past it has always been resolved within a day with Immodium AD and I have no big time pain.  If this is Crohn's (or even Colitis) what type of meds do they put you on and do I even have to go meds?  Currently I am having no big time symptoms of anything.  I do have gas, with belching and flatulence, is that a sign of Crohn's or Colitis?  Just worried, nervous, don't know what the future holds with these meds and this disease.  I have heard the meds have some pretty big time side effects.  Ok Quincy, spill the beans on this stuff!\\nJoanne\\nHi,\\n\\nSorry I haven't answered sooner (missed the last sentence).\\n\\n\\nThere are only 2 inflammatory bowel diseases -- CD and UC.  If UC were suspected, then your rectum would have inflammation and be non-skip upward, which yours isn't.\\n\\n\\nYour ileum is inflammed (it seems characteristic to CD as per the suggestion in the report), as well as the ascending colon (the top part of the colon).  It says colitis, inflammation of the colon, but it wouldn't be UC because that's not the pattern, as well...the ileum isn't affected in UC (unless it's a backwash when the whole colon is affected).\\nYou also have obvious physical changes within the bowel wall of the ascending colon.\\n\\n\\nAs far as medication....there are a few out there.  Since you're not having many symptoms, the doctor might just have you on a 5ASA med.  There are also immunosuppressants and immunomodulators that people are taking in infusions when they are flaring.  Some doctors only push steroids.  I read way too many horror stories about patients being on that stuff for waaaaaaay too long, as well as ending up suffering from the side effects (many for life-long) during and after the meds have been stopped.\\n\\nNo, you might not have to take medication for the rest of your life....but you might have to take medications periodically during your lifetime (if you have CD).\\n\\nI'm not up on all the terminology...just pick out all the words and do a search on them.  At least it'll give you a better idea of what they mean.\\n\\nIt's all a matter of degrees with inflammation.  Some people suffer with severe symptoms and visually things don't look so bad, and it can be the opposite where some people don't have many symptoms and visually it's clearly inflamed.\\n\\nCD affects the entire wall depth of parts of the digestive system from anus to mouth.  UC affects only the colon and sometimes the cecum.\\n\\nYou might find that changing your diet will help with some symptoms.\\nMany people with CD or UC follow the Specific Carbohydrate Diet.  I don't, but many seem to find relief.\\n\\nAs far as the other symptoms you're having...hmmm, it could be related or not. I do know of many people with CD who suffer from belching and upper discomfort. Have you had a small bowel series or an upper gastro scope done?\\n\\nYou'll definitely have to wait for the doctor to say to you what you have.  He/she will give you options for medications.\\n\\nYou must to a thorough search via the internet and the library (medical as well) to find out all about CD.  That way, when the doctor discusses options, you'll make informed decisions.  Get REALLY SMART about it all, especially about the meds.  You don't have to take what you don't want to.\\n\\nLet us know what the doc says about your diagnosis and what options are available to you.\\n\\n\\nHope this helps somewhat...If I find out anything else, I'll post.\\n\\nHang in there till you know exactly what you're dealing with.  Not that it's easy to do, but try not to let the stress overtake you.\\n\\nquincy\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi all....\\nSome of you may have read my other 2 posts about my bf. For those that havent I will try to give u a quick rundown. For the past month he had really bad stomach pains and had diarrhea all day long. Then it started that there would be blood every time he went to the bathroom. Finally he went to the hosptial. They did a cat scan and did blood tests, but did NOT do a colonoscopy- which i personally find odd. He was in the hosptial 6 day. They let him go w/o a diagnosis except that they see his stomach is inflamed but gave him meds and said if it persists to come back. They called him the day after he left saying he has \"ingestive colitis\". Anyway i posted about that bc i couldnt find anything on it online, and everyone said they have never heard of it and maybe they meant ulcerative colitis.Needless to say, he is still in pain. The meds are not working and he is going to be going back to the hospital shortly. I dont understand how they could have given him a diagnosis of colitis if they did not do a colonoscopy but what do i know. I am not a dr. Anyway, I am looking for anyone that knows anything on this subject. A nurse or doctor or anyone that has first hand experience wtih this would be great. As i stated in other posts, his emotional state is really bad. We have a vacation planned for the end of next month and he is thinking we are going to have to cancel since it has been a month and he is still going through this. He wakes up in the middle of the night with pain and everything he eats goes right through him. Does anyone know of anything specific he should ask the drs for- either a test or medication or procedure? I am trying so hard to be positive but it has been a month. I don\\'t know the exact name of the meds they gave him. I am not good with that stuff. But it was just some antibiotic for a week.\\nDoes this sound like ulcerative colitis- since apparently there is no such thing as ingestive colitis?\\nSometimes I really don\\'t like hospitals and doctors. I just dont understand why they didn\\'t do the colonoscopy while he was there and possibly give him a diagnosis right off the bat.\\nSo frusterated\\nWell, any one with knowledge of this would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance. The people on these boards are great!!\\n\\n\\nI guess the first question is, how old is you boy friend?\\n\\nMany conditions can cause diarhea and stomach pain.  Parasites, food poisoning, IBS, Crohn\\'s, etc.  If he is young (in his 20s) the chances of something really serious are slim.\\n\\nIt sounds like it might be IBS, but I\\'m not a doctor.  All the diarhea can cause blood for sure, since the colon gets all inflamed.  Have him see an gastro-interologst to be sure.\\n\\nAside from that, have him alter his diet.  Avoid all dairy and caffeine for at least a week.  Have him take milk of magnesia and take hot baths.  Being in the hospital for 6 days is pretty rare, but maybe there is such a thing as ingestive colitis (acute inflammation fo the upper digestive tract).\\n\\nDon\\'t panic and get worked up.  He\\'s going to recover, but you need to find a good specialist.\\n\\nhe is 28.\\n\\nhe has not had any caffeine for about 2 months, which is good. But he is away doing some volunteer type work at a retreat and will be there for another month. Therefore he has to eat the food that is given to him. When the dr said they saw his stomach was inflamed he thought that maybe he had gotten sick from the food there. But then the dr told him it was that ingestive colitis. With the term ingestive, i thought that this was all caused bc of that food?? He was originally going to the bathroom about 12-15x a day...Every single time it was diarhea. The nurse and dr at the retreat kept giving him kaopectate (sp?) every time he went to the bathroom and said to try that but that didnt work at all. Now hes down to about 7x a day with the medication the drs gave him and there is not always blood but the stomach pains are still there- which are really bad. I told him to ask for a specialist and insist they do the colonoscopy this time.\\nDoes anyone know how long it takes to get ulcerative colitis under control? with the medication does it take days, weeks, months? I have read some things about it online and it doenst say. It just says medication is needed.\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\nHi,\\n\\nI suggest your boyfriend go BACK to the hospital and insist on a colonoscopy and fecal tests.\\n\\nIBS (irritable bowel syndrome) does not cause bleeding.  It may cause anal bleeding because of a fissure or hemorrhoids, but IBS does not cause bleeding.\\n\\nJust because your boyfriend is young, it shouldn\\'t be assumed that there is nothing seriously wrong.\\n\\nUlcerative colitis...it\\'s a life-long disease.  There are many factors in symptoms (where in the colon it\\'s extended), medications, food intake (it doesn\\'t cause flaring, but can make one more uncomfortable -- what goes in goes out).  A patient has flares and quiet states called remissions.  It can take many months for a patient to get a flare controlled....and some patients never get flares controlled and opt for colon removal.   But, rather than going into it further.....none of this applies unless he has ulcerative colitis.\\n\\n\\nIn the interim....if he can get ahold of acidophillus, that might help as well to get the gastro flora back into some kind of balance.\\n\\nIs he the ONLY one with diarrhea at the retreat?\\n\\nSince he\\'s volunteering where he is....maybe he should reconsider and leave to get appropriate medical attention.  A week would be fine, but a month more could possibly put his health into a more serious state.\\n\\nKeep us posted for sure.\\n\\nquincy\\nthank you for the info. From what i got reading online i didnt understand that it was a lifelong problem. Nor did i realize that it could take months to get a flare up under control. how awful!\\n\\n\\nHe is the only one there thats sick. I wish other people there were sick and it was just a bad case of food poisoning. That would be a lot easier in the end.\\n\\nI was in France in 1989 on vacation.  I must have eaten something funky, because I ended up with symptoms similar to your boyfriend.  I had horrible diarhea, 15-20 times a day for over a week.  I couldn\\'t do anything.  Finally, a doctor was called to my hotel, and he injected me with some medication and gave me some pills.  A few days later, I was feeling much better.\\n\\nI\\'m suspicious that the issue could be a parasite or low-level food poisoning.  Jumping to the conclusion that it is UC is counterproductive.  Nevertheless, he should go on leave to get some more medical attention.\\nwell he has had these symptoms for over a month now. in the hospital they gave him an iv and some medication that hes been taking since he got out and he is still having the same problems. and he told me the dr said he had \"ingestive colitis\". i have spoken to many people who all say they have never heard of it and that the dr probably told him ulcerative and he heard him wrong? I asked him last night if the dr could of possibly told him ulcerative colitis and he said its possible but he thought he said ingestive. so either way i dont know. hes back in the hospital now. he went back in a few hours ago. so hopefully i will know more then.\\nDid your boyfriend take any antibiotics recently, such as Erythromycin or a quinolone such as Avelox, Levaquin, or Cipro.  Maybe for a sinus infection or UTI?\\n\\nThese medications can cause colitis (temporary) and something called c-diff.  The bacteria in the digestive tract grows out of control, causing diarhea, pain, and even bleeding.  This can go on for months unless treated.\\n\\nIt is another thing to check into.\\nNo, he has not taken any medication for anything. The only thing he started taking was tums and rolaids once his stomach started acting up. Then he stopped that when he realized they werent working. Other than that he took the kaopectate before he went into the hospital.\\nI havent heard any updates except that he went into the hospital this am.\\nHey sweetie,\\n\\nI am sooo sorry you are still going through this and not really knowing what is wrong with him.  Like I said in an earlier post, make sure he INSISTS on a colonoscopy.  ESPECIALLY since he has diarrhea with lots of bleeding.  A colonoscopy is nothing and the prep for the test (which they will probably do in the hospital) should be a snap since he doesn\\'t have much, if anything, in his system to clean out.\\n\\nPlease keep us updated on his condition.\\n\\nFirewoman',\n",

I saw a rheumy last week that I waited 3 months to see as he supposed to be the best in the area. Anyway~he was very kind and thorough took a little over 2 hours to complete my history and exam. He is sending my blood work to a lab in California that deals soley with arthritis/autoimmune diseases. He was asking about my history and I routinley told him I had been dx with crohns several years ago~but, that it has been in remission for a while now. Actually my biggest stomach complaint is bloating and constipation from pain meds. Any way~he suggested that the crohns that I thought was in remission had taken a turn and resurfaced as arthritis!! I knew they were both autoimmune related but, I never realized the crohns could cause arthritis!! He is also checking me out for other illness such as lupus, RA, Hepatitis C and thyroid.

I've been trying to do research on it and can't find much in the literature about crohns. But the Dr. said they are definatly related. Do you do anything special for treatment? How long have you had the arthritis from when the colitis was diagnosed? I have always had colitis, IBS, and now since a colonoscopy~they are calling it crohns. My stomach has always been a challenge and difficult to find the right balance. Now I guess I have one more challenge to add to the mix.Thanks again; Jan\\n\\nHi Jan, I have always had back problems but didn't know it was arthritis until I got a MRI in 1995. I would take Motrin 800mg first thing in the morning on a empty stomach and was going through a divorce too. I got full custudy of my two girls at that time who were 9 and 12. Anyway, between the stress and Motrin I developed ulcerative colitis in 1996. I did a lot of reseach on it and they say they don't know what causes it but stress was a factor. I guess that is what the doctors say when they don't know. The medicine was very $ and I don't have insurance, but it cleared it up. I would get the occasional flare ups now and then. I think food is something to look at. I had to change to a lactate free milk, no ice cream, etc. I noticed when I ate these things I would have some changes the next morning going to the bathroom. I get a colonoscopy every 3 to 5 years. I read that vitamin K is good for it. I got a lot of info at the bookstore. There are some good web sites too. I can go on and on about it. Usually, in the books you will see they talk about both. Crohns being the worse. Well, Jan I don't know if I answered your ? or not but I will check the posts every day so if I could help let me know. I will find the books I have I give you the titles. They say age is also a factor as far as when you might get this disease. Talk to you later, have a great day, Joe\\n\\nHi~ It's really not the Crohns I need the info about.

Since then test results have shown that there is no sign of C dificle in the stool.  while I was using the medication (Clindoxyl gel) I would suffer bad night sweats but since being off of it those have came to a halt.  I have been suffering pains in my right side of the abdomen (lower down and occassionaly higher).

I also had mucus in my stool and blood as well. another sign is i know it may sound gross but check for a skin tag on your bottom\\nmy thoughts and prayers are with you. i was 22 when diagnosed, i can't imagine having to deal with it through my teenage years. it's true, the longer you let it go, the worse the pain will get! it took them 4 years to diagnose me and then was on a ton of meds for another six months before they finally did my first surgery. today hasn't been a real good day as far as my gut goes...with it being Christmas and all the good foods plus we had 3 places to go, i'm really paying the price right now. lot's of pain and bloating and of course the usual diarrhea. good luck to you!\\n\\nhi i have similar symptoms and have been diagnosed after flex sig with what seems to be uc. interestingly my problems seemed to start after a period of repeated antibiotic use also. see a gastro soon to get a definate diagnosis is my advice.\\ngood luck\\nHey guys,\\n\\nThanks so much for insight.  I have some tests starting mid next month.  Things have been going pretty good latley, not really having diaharrea but still have the need to go after i eat.  I was just wondering if anyone else had suffered from any kinds of skin problems along witht heir crohns.  Ive noticed a bit of a rash develop on my arm twice in the last 2 weeks. It is jsut a bunch of pink dots that blanch when they are touched, and then they go away after an hour or two. Ive also noticed two small boils on my skin, as well as petechiae (the latter doesnt seem to be a symtom of crohn's however).  Has anyone else ever experienced these types of things? Thanks again everyone.\\nYeah! I get boils all the time on my skin.  I have had crohn's for about 4 years.  I also get large abscess, I had to have one surgically removed.  I hope and pray that the docters will find what is really going on with you, I do believe it sounds like Crohn's.  My heart goes out to yoU!  Remember, you really need to keep a positive outlook in life even through the toughest time.  My surgeon always tells me to make it a habit to meitate each morning.  Stress can do bad thing to your stomach and gi tract\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi all,\\n\\nHope you all are feeling better than you were earlier!\\n\\nI have a question and need someone\\'s common sense since I lost mine when a drunk driver hit me almost head on over a year and a  half ago.\\n\\nI have had Crohns\\'s Colitis and Crohn\\'s Disease, since about age 12,  for a long time since I\\'m  almost 52 year young!\\n\\nMy qustion is  this.\\n\\nIf you where having symptoms of crohn\\'s disease in your small intestines only and all tests, even that dangerous PilCam test, showed no active Crohn\\'s but then again there  could be active crohn\\'s since the PilCam got caught in me and after a month it\\'s still stuck in me. Grrrrr.... and my gastro doc said that only less than .019 percent of the people who swallow this cordless camera and they wire u up to electrodes that attach to this box that collects the imagines from the PilCam. but this test could result in the camera getting stick in you somewhere along you gastro intestinal tract.  My gut instincts told me not to have it done but I didn\\'t listn and now I\\'m really confused.\\n\\nMy gastrodoc seems to think I need sugery to repair the strictures that the Pilcam did show but not very clearly and I asked him about the small bowel follow through done about two months ago and he said it showed no active crohn\\'s in my small intestines or strictures..  They did a CT scan back in Oct and from that my colorectal surgeon said it was adhesions that where causing me to have this horrific coliky pain from time to time when something with a lot of fiber gets to the two areas where I had parts of my small intestines removed.  12 ft to be exact.  No jejunum, no deodenum and misssing ten feet of my terminal ileum along with my appendix.\\n\\nNow my surgeon said I could go ahead with the surgery but as anyone who\\'s had surgery knows it just causes more adhesions in a person\\'s gut or wherever the surgeon is cutting into.   I asked him if I chose not to undergo surgery would it be or could it turn into something more nasty and he said no, it\\'s not life threatening IF all the information he got from my bumbling gastro doc was correct.  I\\'m not sure he got all the radiologists information but I will find out when i see that dang pea brain gastroenterologist in two weeks.\\n\\nSo I\\'m sitting here deciding should I risk it and have the surgery since everytime I\\'ve gone under the knife some major complication takes place.  I woke up once and noticed  at age 12 that they where giving me the wrong blood type!!!  I freaked out since I was in Children\\'s Hospitals ICU and started yelling for a nurse accussing them of trying to kill me with the wrong blood type.  I was lucky I caught that in time she said and gave me a shot of gamma goblin and I was OK.   Then one time the pump on the nasogastric tube wasn\\'t working and it felt like my gut was going to explode until I noticed the pump wasn\\'t plugged in after surgery.  I threw my bedpan out in the hallway because I couldn\\' t talk due to the breathing tube they had down my throat all thru this surgery and until I came off of the anesthesia.\\n\\nThere where other horror stories but I had to place them all behind me since I now live in a different state but it\\'s not noted for having great hospitals.  I love my sugeon for being so honest with me but I just know my gastrodoc is going to say why don\\'t you get the surgery.  He doesn\\'t seem to understand how nervous it makes me.  I even went to have a baby delivered and it even turned into a nightmare.  She was suffering fetal distress and my blood pressure was going thru the roof even though my pulse was dropping dangerously low. Nothing made sense even to the four or five doctor\\'s that caem in to see me.  Finally after my daughter\\'s heart stopped and i just about had to do a back flip they had me in the ER room and put me under General Anesthesia, all for what I t hgouht was a no brainer giving birth to a baby in a hospital setting and not at home with a midwife , which was what I wanted but couldn\\'t find one in time.   Lucky I didn\\'t I told myself afterwards.\\n\\nEven a simple trip to the dentist ends wtih something major league wrong with my mouth from previous dental f-ups.\\n\\nThese are just a few of the nasty things they did to me in that hospital or any  hospital anywhere.  I\\'m jinxed even the doctor\\'s the last time I almost bled to death and my doctor told me it was just IBS and I know you do not pass clots of blood if you just have irritalble bowel and not inflamatory bowel disease. The two are alke yes but there is one gigantic difference.  With\\nIBS there is no blood in your stool, perhaps a little bit of mucous and you either go too much or can\\'t go at al.  with IBD you have all the same symptoms of IBS except you do pass blood, vomit ,  are constantly nauseated, and run a low grade fever,  have eye inflamations and joint pains along with a low grade fever.  With a low grade fever you can loose weight along with having no appetite due to the cramps you may get shortly after youe eat anything.  Wel, I don\\'t get the cramps or vomiting but I do have weight loss but I\\'ve been loosing weight since I was hit by that drunken bum from Allen TX. back in Oct of 2004. Adhesions and I know I have a hole gut full of them being opened up four times now.  So should  I risk it and not have the surgery that may or may note help the crohn\\'s since it is inactive or should i go thru with it only to find out that they missed something important on every modern test they give a person with Gastro Intestinal disorders who have a long long history of having Crohn\\'s Disease and Crohn\\'s colitis.   I know there are no gurantees with surgery just as there are none wthi life but if I can manage to heal mysefl, and I honesltly think I can then why go thru with something that could or would most likely land me back into the hospital wth different stricture caused by adhesions two to four years later.\\n\\nChoices are a hard thing to make and usually when I don\\'t get a strong gut feeling tempered with logic then it\\'s either the wrong time or I\\'m in the wrong place at the wrong time and I alway step back until I\\'m almost 100% sure that I know what I  must do as an adult and not a frightened child.\\n\\nSo opinions please??  If n ot you all take care and *peace profound to you and yours*\\nKathyZ SRC\\n\\nI\\'d appreciate any opinions you may have just be gentle. I\\'s my first time I posted to any newsgroup!\\n\\n*peace profound*\\nXOXO KathyZ XOxOX\\nHi Silky, Sorry to hear you\\'ve gone through so much, but you seem to have a good handle on your body. Whether it is adhesions, or the Crohn\\'s acting up, there are risks associated with both. Maybe it would help to write a list of pros and cons for each procedure/option and weigh it out that way.\\n\\nSorry I cannot help. I just wanted to reply and let you know you\\'re not alone here\\n\\nI noticed your post is fairly old. Have you made a decision yet? I also noticed that your um, not too fond\\nof your doc. Have you ever sought out another? A \"fresh pair of eyes\"? (As my GP says). I have been to 5 different doctors, not counting the quacks in the ER.\\n\\nMy doctor thinks I have Crohn\\'s, mainly affecting my small bowel. After reading on adhesions, I could also have that, as I have had a c-section and a D+C, both of which can cause adhesions. The battery of testing is not fun though, and is a long process.\\nThanks For All Your Words Of Wisdom.\\n\\n*peace Profound To You And Yours*\\nKathyz Src',\n",

       " {'post': 'It\\'s me again....\\n........for anyone who hasnt read previous posts of mine......i have recently been diagnosed with crohns and in hospital with it a couple of times.\\n\\nWhen i saw my private consultant on wednesday i looked at my ESR levels as this is a good indicator of crohns if other symptoms are present. Anyway my ESR level was 32 when i was last in hospital, and the first time i was in hospital (the more serious episode) it was 36.\\n\\nApparently in a healthy women the ESR should be no more than 10 as informed by my doctor\\n\\nI am so annoyed!!! and i find it alarming that with an ESR level that high on several occasions and i had the classic signs of crohn\\'s, they miss crohn\\'s!!!!! The pain they put me through, the endless IV\\'s, and they could have eased my symptoms and pain alot quicker by getting the treatment sorted.\\n\\nI have other organ problems at the moment that are also being tested and the consultant says it could be down to the crohns being left unmanaged for such a period of time as this is what can happen.\\n\\nSo i am now at the point of....... what do i do??? Nothing? and move on? or contact the hospital?? any advice please because i am extremely annoyed with this, especially with other complications with my kidney and liver!!!!\\nWell it seems to me like with this issue you\\'re stuck between a rock and a hard place. I honestly have no idea what i would do if I were you. I\\'ve been thinking bout it for awhile, on and off between work, and I really have no idea.\\n\\nIf you went back to the hospital and mentioned their disregard of your ESR level... what can they say? Obviously this is a glitch on their part, because had they been a competent and (for lack of a better word at the moment) good doctor/nursing staff, they would have picked up on this. However, they can come back at you at the same time and say that they were not aware of this being a \"red light\" for Crohn\\'s... or that they were just so busy that they plain out just did not notice. This of course is no excuse... but what satisfaction are you going to get out of going back at them with this? Only more frustration I would think.\\n\\nThen again, if you go back at them with this, then maybe you can prevent other people from enduring the same things you have. I would have satisfaction from this.\\n\\nAlso, I do not know how things work in the UK... but is it possible that you can take legal action over this?? But thinking more about, do you want the frustration and stress that would be associated with that?\\n\\nPlease do not take any of this the wrong way. I know I would be mad as hell if I were you, and would want something done about it. But, I\\'m just trying to look at this from all perspectives. It is really a personal decision... weigh out all the pros and cons of bringing this to the hospitals attention... It\\'s more of a matter of whether you think you will be able to handle all the repercussions (sp?) that would go with it. Or whether its better to look at it as a bad experience and just move on from it and worry about yourself and getting better.\\n\\nI hope maybe some of this is some help. And again, please do not take it all wrong. I said it all with the best intentions.\\n\\nAngela\\n\\nI haven\\'t took any of it the wrong way and i completely understand what you are saying and many thanks for your opinion as that is what i wanted, other opinions as it helps yourself to make informed desicions\\n\\n\\nIt just really annoyed me, i could go and make a complaint but at the end of the day nothing can be done as it has already happened so it isn\\'t as if they can correct anything\\n\\n\\nBut then again i think what if it happens to others, but saying that even if i did complain it will probably go right over their head and not show any concern.\\n\\nAt the time of me writing the first post i was so angry because of the ignorance of the doctors i guess i wanted to vent, and after all there has been far more serious malpractice incidents so i am fortunate really.\\n\\nIts just disgusting how they can brush something like that under the carpet and ignore it\\n\\nIm just still bitter how i have been pushed about for a long time and this has added to teh bitterness. But!!!! im on the road to getting it sorted now\\n\\nThis so ticks me off at the same time.\\nHad they picked up on this... you would have been feeling better months ago, and not suffereing half so much as you are now with \"resultant\" symptoms of the Crohn\\'s.\\n\\nHad you not gone private... my good god... what state would you have been in now?????\\nI don\\'t think you would have a diagnosis still.... and that really scares me.....\\nI was typing my second message the same time you were typing!\\n\\nI agree... I honestly think even if you did go back... it wouldn\\'t accomplish anything... they would go on about their business... with not a care in the world about the pain that you are going through... and unfortunately...  I think more people are going to go through the same thing... what about a media outlet of sorts? or a journal? just to make the public aware of the situation... and warn others that way... Tell people your personal experiences and story....  I always tell people that they have to take their health into their own hands and not give up, because of such incidents... Doctors are only human, not gods, and CAN ( and often do ) make mistakes!\\n\\nAnywayz... If you can take the added stresses, maybe that would be a good idea. But, do remember, YOU come first... make sure you\\'re strong enough to go through this... maybe something you can do once you\\'re feeling better? Maybe in a few months or a year... once you have yourself healthier....',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi\\n\\nI\\'m hoping someone can help with some advice as i am at my wits end and it is really getting me down. I have posted before but it has only been the past couple of days that i am wondering if it is crohn\\'s due to research i have been doing.\\n\\nMy problems started in August last year, i started getting alot of pain around my large intestine, the pain and inflammation was that bad my liver enzymes raised and my blood count was low, even though i was not bleeding. Over the next couple of months the pain moved to my small intestine, excruiating pain. I have been diagnosed with anemia twice since my stomach problems started.\\n\\nIn Jan this year i was rushed to hospital with a small twisted bowel, i was nil by mouth for 9 days and on Iv fluids and meds, i was discharged with no follow up appointment. In feb this year i was back in hospital, this time i had 2 dialated loops in my small bowel, again was nil by mouth.\\n\\nI am in constant pain in my small bowel i have lost alot of weight, getting night fevers, nausea and cannot eat as it makes the pain worse. I have been off work since August last year due to the pain, it makes me unable to move, walk do anything! It is very debilitating. Horrible pain and the worse cramping ever along with hyperactive gruggling noises.\\n\\nTests........\\n\\nI had a sigmoid done, came back normal\\nBarium enema came back normal\\nUltrasound mf my abdomen came back normal\\nGastrograph follow through of the small bowel came back that my small bowel is very sluggish and slow.\\nBlood work came back as anemia and raised liver enzymes\\n\\nI know that crohn\\'s can affect the whole disgestive system, and i am wondering if it is this that i have. It is really depressing and like i said the pain is horrendous. I am also wondering if it is crohns it is that bladly inflamed this is why the pain relief isnt working and this is why i iam in such pain becuase it isnt being controlled. Therefore it is getting progressively worse.\\n\\nI am awaiting a small bowel enema test. I am no meds just pain relief\\n\\nI would appreciate any advice from anyone who knows about crohns.\\nHi again Sharon, you\\'re going to be sick of me, and I am probably not the first person you want to hear from. but it seems we are going through the same crap right now, and I have researched it alot too.\\n\\nI too am suspected of Crohn\\'s, and what you have described seems to fit Crohn\\'s, although the twisting/looping I have not heard of, Crohn\\'s does cause alot of symptoms, and cannot be narrowed to a list of things. What is listed on most research sites are the most common symptoms.\\n\\nSo what made you decide to research Crohn\\'s? What about the birth defect with the volvus (sp?)? Last I heard you had almost ruled out Crohn\\'s...\\n\\nAs for tests, the barium enema and barium swallow with small bowel follow through are the most common tests to check for inflammation, but will not always catch it. You\\'ve had most of the tests. If the barium enema shows nothing, then colonoscopy would be the next route.\\n\\nThe sigmoid, as it was explained to me, sometimes comes back normal as it only checks the lower 1/3 of the colon and if the Crohn\\'s is in the small bowel it obviously cannot detect it.\\n\\nYou have all the classic signs and symptoms, right to the anemia, which would be caused by a malabsorption, again as a result of trauma from the crohn\\'s/inflammation. Has your consultant looked into this? Maybe if he tried you on some of the meds for Crohn\\'s, to see if that gives you some relief. Normal pain relievers would not help. I believe for Crohn\\'s they give sulfasalazine for mild to moderate attacks, and 5-ASA is another one. The CCFC of Canada has a really good site, sorry I cannot post it, but try searching for it.\\n\\nI really feel sympathetic, as I am having the same freaking problems, right to the nausea, deficiencies/anemia, and the slow medical world.\\n\\nI have friends/family with this disease, and although it is not easy nor fun and causes alot of complications, with proper treatment/care it can be controlled.\\n\\nFunny, I am actually wishing for this diagnosis at this point as then I can actually start treating it and feeling better. They have already figured out I have a malabsorption problem, and are thinking Crohn\\'s is my problem. I know I\\'m sick and twisted, but I just want some damn relief at this point.\\n\\nKeep Posting\\n\\nAngela\\n\\nPS seems I am not pregnant\\nand can now continue with my xrays (barium swallow with small bowel follow through)... tomorrow morning. Not looking forward to it, but has to be done. Kinda sick though, how slowof a process this is. I almost wish I was paying for it, then maybe I would get better service.\\nHi Angela.....yep same crap!!!! gets depressing doesnt it!!!!\\n\\nI dont know what made me research crohns. i think i have a gut feeling that this is what it is. I mean how can a person be so ill and in so much pain if it is just a defect from birth, surely it would have bothered me before i reached 30!!!\\n\\nAnyway as for the twisting and looping, i found a good website and it says that because crohns narrrows your small intestine this can cause twisting, obstruction and looping. therefore i think if it is crohns my case has gone past just meds helping as it sounds like my bowel has started to narrow.The website also said that night fever is common amongst crohns disease as this is when the inflammation can reach its highest, and i get these night fevers, have done for awhile. It also said that when it gets out of control it can affect the liver and other major organs, this is why my liver enzymes have been high.\\n\\nAlso apprently crohns doesnt have to effect your large bowel, it can just affect your small bowel and stomach this is why the large bowel tests have shown up negative, i havent got it in my large bowel. As for the birth defect i think the consultant was at a loss, i personally dont think it is a birth defect.\\n\\nI have just got my appointment through for my small bowel enema, it is on wednesday morning.\\n\\n\\nI just want some relief, i feel desperate now!!!! to the point of i will try any medication to see if it helps!!!! I\\'ll be posting in the addiction/recovery board soon .....lol\\n\\nGood luck with your test, you\\'ll be fine\\n\\nYeah, believe it or not Crohn\\'s can affect anywhere from the mouth to the anus.\\n\\nAs for your consultant... he sounds much like most doctors, no idea what is wrong, so lets just tell the patient SOMETHING so they don\\'t keep asking questions. Are you still seeing him? or sought another? I am still waiting on the enema... can\\'t get me in until April 19\\ngreat medical system.\\n\\nGood Luck and let me know how it goes. Here\\'s hoping they finally figure it out as this has been way too long for you now. I mean, if it comes down to it, and you have to have surgery, I\\'m sure you will be fine, you seem like a very strong woman\\n\\nAs for the addiction. I am so with you there. LOL, Hi my name is Angela and I\\'m an _______ (insert med of choice). I have been on all kinds of anti-spasmodics and pain relievers, but that does nothing. Doesn\\'t even take the edge off anymore.\\n\\nKeep me updated.\\nand again Good Luck.\\nHere\\'s hoping someone who has already been diagnosed with Crohn\\'s kicks in....\\n\\nThere are alot of things I\\'m sure they could help you out on. Although it sure is nice to know someone else is going through the testing too... although not nice to know the pain they too are suffering... At least you know somebody understands.....\\nHi sharon,\\n\\nI was diagnosed with crohns disease about 7 years ago.. Your symptoms do sound familiar, the pain was just as you discribed, i had to stop work, and the gurgling noises, i got those, the pain always intesified after eating, hence weight loss due to not wanting to cause pain, im not sure about the twisted bowel thing but i had an intestinal obstruction,  i was diagnosed after having a laparoscopy, sorry not sure of the spelling, that is where they use i think, keyhole surgery to have a look at whats going on in your insides, i had the deseiase where the small and large intestine join together (the most common place apparently) and went on to have the infected parts removed. had all the other tests but im not sure what they were called so not sure if you\\'ve had the same but, i remember the colonoscopy, and the one where they insert a tube up your nose, down your throat, to take xtrays of the small bowel but the starting point was when i was admitted with a high white blood count, that ment there was infection in the body sumwhere... I really hope you get a diagnosis soon as its scary not knowing whats rong and you will feel so much better once you know what your dealing with.\\nHi Nikki\\n\\nMany thanks for your reply.\\n\\nI am having that test done on wednesday (the one with the tube up my nose down into my small bowel) My weight is that bad my bones are quite prominent in some areas now, especially around my hips and ribs.\\n\\nMy bloods are always coming back as showing signs of infection, but i end up being put on anti biotics and nothing else done, no follow up appointments or anything.\\n\\nI have tried spasmonal,colofac,colpermin,buscupan (all for the cramping) but none of them have worked.\\n\\nits annoying because i used to be so healthy, diet wise exercise wise. But now, i hardly eat and just walking for 5 mins ends in me being in so much pain.\\n\\nI have had twisting, looping and obstructions of my small bowel which makes me think that the bowel wall is narrowing due to this crohn\\'s if it is that. I cant describe the pain as much as i would like to because its very difficult to describe and so painful.\\n\\nLike you said and Angela in the previous post, i just want to know whats wrong with me so i can start dealing with it because at the moment i am feeling really low and in so much pain.\\n\\nthank you for your reply\\n\\nI\\'ve been reading all your post and have learned sooo much! Thank you! I was diagnosed yesterday with Crohn\\'s after a 2 year struggle with unbearable pain at night,infections, high fever\\'s,off the chart white count\\'s and so on- you know!

       " {'post': 'A very good friend of mine was recently diagnosed with possible Crohns Disease.  She has severe diarrhea and abdominal cramping for 2-3 months now.  They performed a colonoscopy and found 1 area of inflammed tissue (an ulcer).  They sent her for some blood work to \"test\" for Crohns, but the research I found on the internet said that there is no one good test to determine if Crohns is present or not.  They claim that a high white blood cell count and anemia (indicating possible blood in the stool) COULD be Crohns Disease?  I am confused.\\n\\nMy question, how is Crohns Disease different from IBS or Ulcerative Colitis?  Is the treatment different?  The prognosis different?  This poor girl is going to think she has a \"disease\" instead of just a \"condition\".  What is the difference other than the name?\\n\\nAny information you can provide for us would be helpful!  Thanks!\\n\\nWen\\nHi Wendy\\n\\nThe main difference between IBS and IBDs (Crohns and UC) is that IBS is a \\'syndrome\\'.  I guess that means that there are no physical abnormalities, like there would be with Crohns and/or UC (ulcers, inflammation, etc)  And IBS  does not progress, but IBDs certainly can.  IBS has no known cause..and there are many variations of it (constipation predominant, diarrhea predominant, etc)  During a colonoscopy, you would not see any outward sign of disease or inflammation of the tissues..or structural abnormalities that might be causing the symptoms. Because of this, IBS is hard to manage and treat, because there is no known medication or regimen that works for everyone..or even all the time for an individual. Also, IBS has never been proved to progress or make someone more at risk for things such as colon cancer or IBDs. There seems to be quite a number of people though with IBS, that also have other autoimmune problems\\n\\nIBDs..on the other hand WILL show signs (ulcer, inflammation, etc.)\\n\\nIBDs can be called disorders(diseases) abecause they can/do cause inflammation or ulceration in the digestive tract.  The parts most affected (depending on the type of IBD) can be anywhere from the mouth to the anus. UC is seen more often than Crohns.\\n\\nLike IBS, IBDs are a chronic condition, but people can have quite lengthy remissions at times..with practically no symptoms at all. And flare ups can appear without warning. Some of the symptoms are abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and diarrhea and constipation. They might also have a temperature and a loss of appetite.  I know, other than the rectal bleeding (NOT a sign of IBS)...the other symptoms sound very similar to those with IBS. Many people have been misdiagnosed with IBS, when actually suffering from an IBD..until more thorough testing is done anyway.\\n\\nPeople with only mild IBDs can somtimes be treated with antidiarrheals and/or a restricted diet. Others, where the symptoms are more severe need much stronger medications, and may also have to face surgery(in the most severe cases)\\n\\nThe symptoms between Crohns and UC are somewhat similar, but because of where they(ulcers) may occur, it makes it easier to diagnose.  UC usually affects the colon and rectum.  Crohns is more difficult as some of its earliest symptoms might just be fatigue, joint pain, etc.  Many people go years without being correctly diagnosed because of this. Crohns can be seen anywhere between the mouth to the anus (unlike UC, which is generally only in the colon and rectum). It can affect the deepest layers of the lining of the GI tract(deep ulcers and sores). Because it can affect so many different areas of the GI tract, it can cause vague symptoms at first.  It also usually shows up in \\'patches\\'.  There can be normal tissue right next to diseased/ulcerated tissue...and this gives a certain image to the person performing the colonoscopy that is not hard to identify.  I think they call it \\'cobblestoning\\'. Also with Crohns, the deep tissue damage can cause strictures, or narrowings that may eventually cause bowel obstructions...or they may cause fistulas.\\n\\nUC is most common on the left side of the colon, and it may affect the lower end of the small intestine where it meets the colon.  Remember, UC does not affect other parts of the digestive tract like Crohns does, and it hardly ever goes into the deepest tissues of the intestines. But there is a higher risk of colon cancer with UC that there is for Crohns.\\n\\nThe different testing methods that can be used to differentiate(sp) between the two are : flex sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, Abd. xray, Upper GI series, endoscopy, barium enema, CT scan. Also stool analysis is almost always done. This can show blood in the stool, bacterial infection, malabsorption, parasites, or the presence of white blood cells. Blood and urine tests are done to check for anemia, inflammation and to see if there is any malnutrition. ESR or sed rate or CRP blood tests can be done to check for inflammation or infection that might be caused by an IBD. And biopsy of intestinal tissue can be taken during an upper endoscopy, sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. This can help determine the \\'type\\' of IBD, and to \\'rate\\' the inflammation and tissue damage or to check for any tumors.  The tissue biopsy is just a minute piece of tissue and is not painful...but if a person has had UC for any length of time , there are multiple biopsies taken for cancer screening.\\n\\nThis is pretty long-winded, but it can maybe help show the difference between IBDs and IBS .  As you mentioned in your post there is a certain percentage (15-20%) of people who have the symptoms AND inflammation, but the type of IBD can\\'t be determined..and the Drs. feel that this is because it is a combination of Crohns and UC.\\nDennie,\\n\\nYour information was very helpful!  Thank you so much!\\n\\nWendy',\n",

       " {'post': 'Recently I had a cat scan and my doctor said the results are highly suggestive that I have crohns disease. He wants me to have a GI series done now to confirm. I have been experiencing bouts of severe stomach pains on and off for a couple of years. I cant imagine labor pains could be any worse. I do not have diarrhea often which my doctor says is a symptom of crohns. I have pain during and after intercourse which I am not sure is related to the stomach issues or something female. I go to the GYN the beginning of April. Does anyone have Crohns that could share with me your symptoms and experiences?\\nWhat about the CAT scan made him suspect this? I didnt think  you could detect chrohn\\'s from a CAT scan? I know there are some blood tests that can be indicative.\\n\\nI\\'d be curious to hear more about this. I always wanted to make sure I didnt have Chrohn\\'s. I had a CAT scan too and blood work, and I dont have diarrhea, just abdominal pain...and my doc said he was sure it wasnt chrohns?\\n\\nI would like to know how Crohns is diagnosed.  I\\'ve had all the tests from MRI,CT,Barium enema, blood & stool cultures.  I do have diahrrea, after eating & upon rising in the a.m.  I was tagged w/IBS.  Can\\'t take antispasmodics due to side effects.  Immodium is my only relief.  I eat yogurt, take Metemucil & plan to try a probiotic.  My quesiton is did I have enough testing done to determine IF I do have Crohns?  Does the average MD look for such a disease or are they concerned w/bacteria/etc??  Any input appreciated.  Thanks and          GOD BLESS AMERICA\\nInteresting topic, my GP told me he thinks I have IBS to go along with the anxiety problems I\\'ve had on and off the last year. I\\'ve had abdominal cramping and pain focused mainly on my left side.\\n\\nInitially the docs thought I had a kidney stone as I had trace blood in my urine. I had an x-ray that showed some build up on the right side and 3 small \"irregularities\" on the left.\\n\\nI was pretty happy to accept that it could be IBS until today when I went to the toilet and there was some blood and mucus in there. I didn\\'t go much, but it was very loose.\\n\\nOf course I\\'m now panicing it could be IBD, Crohns or ulcerative colitis or something.\\n\\nWhat do you think?\\nI don\\'t know what my doctor saw in the Cat scan that suggested IBS. I will be sure to ask. Now I have to have a small bowel study to confirm. He doesnt want to start treating me for IBS unless he is sure.\\nChris,\\nWhat tests did you have done to make your doctor think that you have IBS? I dont know what blood in the stool could be.\\nHi! I have Crohns Disease. I have had it for 11 years now. It took Docs a year to find that I had the disease. I had my appendix out and that is when they found the Crohns. I have to have routine a Colonoscopy each year to see how much of the intestine is affected by the disease. You may want to ask your doc if he thinks you need a colonoscopy. This is the only way they are able to see inside the intestine. My Crohns is located in the small bowel and usually reacts well to medication. I had been in remission for 5 years until a year ago. I have had a really bad flair-up these past two weeks and none of the meds have worked. Good luck with your tests and if you would like any other information on Crohns try the Crohns & Colitis Foundation\\'s Web site. They offer some really good advise and can help keep you updated on the new trial meds and procedures for Crohns and IBS. Hang in there and best of luck.\\nHey Ladybug, could you please give the [url=\"http://www.for\"]www.for[/url]  the Crohn\\'s & Colitis Foundation?  I tried pulling up several different combos & got nothing.  This sounds like a site I\\'d like to see.  Thanks for your help & good luck to you in your quest.\\nPost&gt;&gt;&gt; I have pain during and after intercourse which I am not sure is related to the stomach issues or something female. I go to the GYN the beginning of April. Does anyone have Crohns that could share with me your symptoms and experiences? &lt;&lt;&lt;\\n\\nI don\\'t have Crohns but I have IBS and a metabolic dysfunction that includes IBS in it\\'s many symptoms.\\nWhen I had symptoms similar to yours I started out with a Gynecologist.\\nI went throgh 3 of them and an emergency room visit inbetween before I could get anyone to go inside with a Laproscope and check out my pelvic condition.\\nI had massive adhesions and enodmetriosis binding my colon to my ovary and musculature of the pelvic girdle.\\nMy colon had to be spearated from both the ovary and the muscle wall and 20 days after that surgery my colon simply stopped working and I had energency surgery to remove an impaction.\\na few months later, after seeing still another gynecologist and another gastroenterologist about my unresolved pain, I finally figured out that I might need a Reproductive Endocrinologist to tend my mystery illness.\\nThe Reproductive Endocrinologist did a third surgery and found my colon all bound up again with the pelvic muscle. More adhesions and more endocetriosis.\\nSo that was january and I\\'m doing better in the colon department but I stay on daily IBS medication because after all of that the bowel still remains irritable and if I don\\'t tend my gut from a nutritional life style perspective then I\\'d probably be back in the hospital with another shut down.\\nThe problem I have is a metabolic endocrine problem.\\nIt is linked to IBS and in some way to autoimmune diseases but they are not sure why as yet.\\nI was told by my endocrinologist that 95% of the women he treats with the metabolic problem have IBS and that a large percentage go on to eventually manifest an autoimmune disorder but they have not seen a pattern of\\nany one disorder over another. They just fall into the same general category of one of the problems where the body attacks itself.\\nI would guess that maybe a Reproductive Endocrinologist could point you in the right direction as to which specialty might help you the most.\\nkat\\n\\n\\n\\nPost&gt;&gt;What tests did you have done to make your doctor think that you have IBS? I dont know what blood in the stool could be.&lt;&lt;&lt;\\n\\nAs it was explained to me, there are no tests for IBS.\\nIBS is a Syndrome, which means it is diagnosed with a series of symptoms that fit a particular criteria.\\nSpecifically that would be the \"Rome Criteria\" for IBS. The Rome Criteria is the decisions that Doctors make after getting together to set criteria for Syndromes and diseases.\\nIt then becomes the measuring standard.\\nChroons is an Irritable Bowel Disease which means something else and I think the definitive difference is that with Chrons you have inflammation of the internal colon, which could be seen with a colonoscopy.\\nAnd with IBS there is no inflammation or physical abnormality to the internal gut.\\nSo by virture of normalcy with in the gut, is one of the ways they decide if one has IBS or IBD.\\nBlood in the stool can mean a whole lot of things.\\nAlways best to get the Gastroenterologist to do a colon scope on that one. But a lot of times blood in the stool or even gushing out the rectum turns out to be hemorroids in one of their forms.\\nInternal hemorroids(the kind you can\\'t see,) can become quite the bloody problem.\\nGood luck with finding the source of your problems.\\nHope they find ressolve soon.\\nkat\\nThe site for the Crohns & Colitus foundation is [url=\"http://www.ccfa.org\"]www.ccfa.org[/url]  I hope this helps. I had to go back to the doc last Thursday and he thinks my crohns has infected more of my intestine that we thought. I go on two strict weeks of antibiotic...I cant get rid of a fever (100.2) then we are gonna look into Remicade. Has anyone tried this therapy? If so any insite would be great. I can tell you that if you have IBS or Crohns on of the best things to do is to get a GREAT doctor. It makes all the difference. My best to all, may your pain be less!\\nMy doctor has confirmed that I have Crohns disease. He has prescribed 2400mg a day of Asacol. So far the drug has made me feel disoriented, weak and no appetite. I guess my body has to get used to it. Kat, thanks for the website regarding Crohns. I am also having what I think is female pain but now I\\'m not sure if its related to the Crohns or not.\\nKat,\\nPlease let me know the results of your GYN visit.

And can you tell me more specifically what your symptoms are in detail? Thanks. I also do NOT have diarrhea, and want to compare notes. I had a CAT scan, but doctor didnt think I had Chrohn\\'s.

       " {'post': 'I have been having stomach problems for several years now. My symptoms are:\\nModerate to severe pain in my upper left abdomen (pain sometimes lessens if I lay down). Frequent nausea. Strong and constant garlic like taste coming up from my throat, causing my breath to smell very badly (started a few months ago, just recently stopped). no appetite, bowel movements go back and forth from diarrhea to constipation. Has anyone else had these symptoms? Does anyone know what this might be? Thanks for your help.\\nTweet,\\n\\nHave you ever had your liver evaluated?  If your liver enzymes are elavated, it would definatly cause fatigue, nasuea, sometimes pain, and some of the GI symptoms.  This is a disgusting question but, are your stools really pale in color - almost like a clay/sand color?? If so, that could be another indicator that your liver might be off.  Another question, do you ever suffer from uncontrolled itching? Like you want to tear your skin off??  If so, I would run not walk to your docs office and have them draw a Chem 22 to check your ALT/AST/GGTP/Alk Phos/ etc... I have Crohns disease from my trachea to the rectum and it the crohns has done a number on my liver... probably need a new one in the next 8-10 years... so I sorta know what I am talking about!\\n\\nI hope this is helpful (by the way, all the symptoms that I spoke of up above are all in my inventory) and although the medical literature says that the liver is incapable of producing pain - it\\'s a bunch of hogwash.  I will walk into my docs office and point to the exact spot and sure enough my enzymes will be skyhigh (most should be 50 or under and I have hit the 900\\'s before.\\n\\nGood luck, take care\\n\\nzarra\\nI had a blood test done last week and the doc called me yesterday and told me that my liver enzymes were high but not enough to worry about. My stools have been either a light grey or green. I do have itching all over too. I have another appointment with my doctor, next month (feb 15), should I make it sooner or will it be ok to wait until then?\\nTweet,\\n\\nI think waiting for the next round of blood tests is okay.  My doc always tells me that the low numbers (meaning under 5000) is an indicator that something is sloooooowly happening and that it could be nothing at all.  If the doc is saying your numbers are high but not high enough to get all excited about then I think you are ok.  BUT I would call him and tell him about the itching - because there are meds they can put you on that will stop or at least ease the itching... the ones they have had me on are Zyrtec (an allergy med) and/or Atarax (generic name Hydroxyz HCl) both have saved my sanity more than once.\\n\\nI am glad to know that you have had a liver panel drawn and I would really wait until the next appointment to have your labs drawn again..  Also, I think it would be to your advantage if your doc did an exam of your abdomen to make sure your liver isn\\'t palpably enlarged.\\n\\nIt sucks that you are having these troubles, but it is nice to know that my diagnostic sense is still working!\\n\\nHope all that helps - definatly call and make them give you something for the itching.  Both the meds I listed are prescription only - the atarax is much much cheaper (I had more success with this one).\\n\\nTake care, be well, and God bless!\\n\\nzarra\\nTweet,\\n\\nAnother possibility is that the pancreas is acting up.  Recently I was diagnosed with late stage, idiopathic, chronic pancreatitis and I have most times diarrhea, sometimes constipation, but never any happy medium.  My stools too tend to be gray or green or very dark, like there is blood from somewhere.\\n\\nHow I found out about the pancreatitis is because I had an \"oil slick\" with the diarrhea.  Looked very similiar the way fat will come to the top of cooling chicken broth.  I too have a lot of pain on the left side.  Sometimes it goes across my back and I can feel it on the right side as well.\\n\\nYou may want to ask your doctor is this is a possibility.\\n\\nHope your feeling better.\\n\\nReeAnn\\nReeAnn,\\nI too have Idiopathic Pancreatitis, I have had it for just oveer two years and it is ruining my life. I have been in the hospital for at least six months of each year (total, not one stretch). I am curious as to what your Dr. is doing for treatment. I don\\'t know anyone else who has this and I wonder if I am getting the best treatment possible.I have had several surgeries and I don\\'t seem to get well. I went from being 5\\'7\" tall, 120 lbs., to being 78 lbs. I look like a walking corpse. I have heard that one can have the pancreas removed but my doctor will not even discuss it with me, he just says that it can cause severe diabetes and he will not consider it. I know people who have diabetes and they seem much better off than myself. I have racked up thousands of dollars in medical bills because insurance always finds reasons to deny claims for one reason or another. I have lost my husband and if my health does not improve soon I may lose my business. Each time I leave the hospital, I am a little worse off physically, emotionally and financially. I am only 33years old and I don\\'t know how much longer I can go on like this. I guess I am hoping to find out that my doctors are ultra-conservative and that someone else may be able to do something for me. Please let me know how things are going with you and what your doctors are suggesting for you.I hope to hear back from you soon.\\nThanks,\\nGemmi\\nGemmi,\\nI am so sorry to hear that you are going through so much. If you don\\'t mind, I would like to keep you in my prayers.\\nI went to my GI specialist last week and he scheduled me for an endoscopy for next week.He also gave me Prevacid to take every morning, he doesn\\'t seem to think that it is my pancreas or liver. I have been having so much problems with nausea lately, I can\\'t eat, I have gone days without eating, and I am down to 90 lbs I look horrible and it hurts when I sit down because I no longer have a rear to cushion my bones. In addition to my regular symptoms, I have also been having some problems with my esophogus, I feel like I have a lump  deep down in my throat and it hurts every time I move my neck. I have also been waking up with broken blood vessels all around my eyes (3 times this month) and my right arm keeps going numb I don\\'t know if any of that even makes sense, I told my doctor about all these weird symptoms I have been having lately, but he didn\\'t tell me what he thought it might be, he just told me I need to have some tests done. The prevacid seems to help the nausea and pain for a few hours but it always comes back by the evening time. I am so tired of being in pain all the time, I just want to feel normal. Nobody seems to understand that I can\\'t just make myself feel better. If you ever need anyone to talk to or just listen to you, let me know, I would be glad to.\\nTweet,\\nI truly feel your pain, I am very sorry that you have this to deal with. I hope for your sake that it turns out not to have anything to do with your pancreas. Most of your symptoms suggest otherwise though. I don\\'t have problems with my esophogus but the pain and constant nausea I am very familliar with. I know about the weight loss too and that may be why your arms keep falling asleep. I am very skinny now and when I go to sleep I have to make sure that my legs are not laying on top of each other because my the weight of my bones will cut off blood circulation. The same thing happens if I fall asleep with my arm under my head or my side, there is no longer any insultaion around my blood vessles so it is very easy to cut off blood flow. As for the broken blood vessels around your eyes, I only get that when I am throwing up a lot, which is pretty much when ever I eat. I have been on feeding tubes and TPN but they never put any weight on me. I have had about 8 endoscopies and if you have never had one, don\\'t be afraid, they are no big deal unless you do in fact have pancreatitis, then they can cause a flare up, but for the most part you are asleep and it is painless. I wish you much luck and I hope they find out that you have something that is easy to fix.\\n\\nIf anyone can tell me what sort of treatments they are receiving for chronic pancreatitis, I would greatly appreciate hearing about it. There has got to be something that I can do, I just need to find out about it.\\nThanks,\\nGemmi',\n",

Sorry this was so long but I hope it has helped you some.\\nI go thru the whole array of pain.  Abdominal area right by the belly button, my joints, back, sternum etc.  It has literally laid me up for weeks, just was off work for a few months, it consumes me at times.  I have been on everything. Asacol, Pentasa, Remicade, prednisone, analgesics you name it.  These doctors keep pushing me on immune depressants, and I don't tolerate them.  The side effects can be worse than the disease!  The prednisone mixed with the analgesics is the only path that I have found that works.  Unfortunately, my docs balk at prescribing the pain meds as they get scared and start worrying about the addiction.  Then my family doctor refuses to treat me anymore due to his inexperience with this disease.  Huh??!!  What happened during those yrs. at medical school?  My GI is a complete idiot, one in a long line, and I have been using online resources for the time being to continue treatment. The only problem is that often, the meds are not strong enough and I have to take alot, which can bring on it's own problems. I wish my doctor was like yours and put me on something that would work.  I don't think I will get on the neurontin, I don't need the short term memory loss problems.  That was a pain clinic doctor's recommendation, neurontin and stronger analgesics.  What do you think?  Any advice?  Thanks man.\\nI have trouble with my GI also. When I first started seeing my new family doc he wanted a consult with the GI. The GI told him my back wasn't that bad and I didn't need anything for it. He was the one that kept putting me on nsaid's for it and couldn't figure out the nsaid's were aggravating my crohns. My family doctor didn't listen to him because he had seen my back in terrible spasms and when checking my sacroiliac joint it locked so he knew things weren't right. Besides addiction I think the reason GI's don't like crohns or uc patients on narcotics is because they can cause constipation which can lead to bowel impaction. My suggestion would be to find another GI and push to get a referral to a rheumatologist. I am going to ask my doc about the neurontin and see if it would possibly help my back pain. I have an appointment at a pain clinic for the end of this month so things may not be so easy for me then lol. It may be a blessing your family doc doesn't want to treat you because of his inexperience with crohns. You really need a doc that you can be totally open with and one that understands the disease as it is not an easy one to live with or to treat. Good luck and I hope this helps you some.\\nThe incompetence and the hostility that I have encountered with the wide array of doctors that I have seen, is ridiculous.  I live with the disease everyday, and I know my own body.  Everytime that I suggest a treatment plan, I get pooh poohed, and they want to sign me up for the newest pharmaceutical nightmare that is on the market. I refuse to go down that path anymore.  I know what works for me, and eventually I will find a doctor that will listen.  I am trying out the National Pain people, and already have gotten positive feedback from them.  In their experience, they have found that Crohn's patients responded well to oipoid therapies.  See, we are not crazy!!!  I'll let you know how it goes...\",\n",

I am very petite and just the right size but I constantly hide my stomach because of its appearance-  it is bulging and I do not think it is because I am fat or obese.  I am on average weight for my height and am very puzzled about this stomach.  I have an ongoing on and off abdominal pain esp in the left lower area and recurrent diarrhea and constipation.  When I drink a glass of water,  I would be in the toilet every 10 minutes to urinate.  I have chest/neck pains.  Sometimes,  my anus and genital area would itch.  Does anyone has an opinion about this?  What causes abdominal swelling or protrusion?  Anyone out there experiencing the same as I do?  I will be seeing a gastro esp sometime this month but it would be helpful if someone could at least share their experiences .... Thanks.\\nIt sounds like it is time to break down and go see the doctor.  The bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea/constipation could indicate diverticulosis or Crohn's disease or something along those lines.  Urgency to urinate is a little more scary as it might indicate that you are developing a fistula.  None of these conditions get better by waiting, but can get worse and infected and you could have a really big mess, like I did before I finally got things treated.  Please make an appointment today and get checked out.\",\n",

My blood tests showed no sign of the ulcer bacteria (forgot the name..), and I seemed somewhat better.\\nThen New Year\\'s Eve happened...This may have nothing to do with my current problem, but the timing is suspicious...I arrived at a party late, and like an idiot decided I should \"catch up\" and drank 6 beers in about an hour and a half (this isn\\'t a habit).\\nThat night I ALMOST threw up, and in the back of my throat I swear I tasted blood.\\nSince then, I have been unable to eat much...I have trouble swallowing, I have to squirm around and burp a lot just to swallow a tiny amount of food successfully, and often this difficulty comes with a rush of adrenaline, panic I suppose until the food goes down.(I am 24, and this problem has occurred every few meals for 10 years, to a lesser degree. Now it\\'s Every Bite...)\\nThen starting last night(two days after running out of the acid reducer) I\\'m getting the heartburn...Example: tonight I ate a very small dinner, six hours after lunch and I wasn\\'t really hungry, I just figured I should eat...I had trouble swallowing, and couldn\\'t even finish eating (mini frozen pizza, like 5\" in diameter). Two hours later, I got this heartburn, and felt like I had fluid at the back of my throat...tasted like blood. After five hours, I still have the heartburn and the fluid sensation. At the same time, my mouth and throat seem very very dry, even when I drink water, which doesn\\'t help. I also seem to be constipated, somewhat.\\nI know I\\'ll have to sleep upright tonight, and I\\'m afraid to eat, and I\\'ve  lost three pounds this week.

It sounds to me as though you may have damaged your throat tissue with the alcohol. He can look way down your throat. Now if you are not satisfied with that or you wish to pursue a Gastroendorologist, he also can give you a endoscopy which will look down your throat to see if you have anything there. I am no expert but the Gastroendorologist  is  a specialist in liver, colon, stomach will diagnose you. He can give you meds, do a colonoscopy, endoscopy,  no major surgery. As far as your regular physician thinking you are a hypochondriac, he probably is not qualified to help you anyway in the area you need. That is what specialists are for.\\nI think gastroenterologist are fairly common.  They are usually the specialist who deal with reflux type problems (among many other things).  I see one for severe reflux and a condition called Barrett\\'s esophagus which is a precancerous condition.  I don\\'t live in a large city and I had no trouble finding one.  I guess the other suggestion about a eye, ear, nose, throat doc is a good one too, but I wouldn\\'t delay if you\\'ll be off insurance in February.  Good luck\\nThanks for all of your replies...I have an upper g.i. barium swallow bit scheduled for this Friday at the city hospital, so hopefully my mind and stomach will be set at ease soon.\\n\\nThanks!! -George\\nSee a gastro doc.\\nIf you continue to have reflux, it could cause ulcers of the esophagus.  Thats a bad thing to have because those ulcers could eventually become cancerous.\\nIf prescription antacids don\\'t help then get a fundi-plication(sp?) done.  It is a surgical procedure that will stop reflux forever!',\n",

To dignose the GERD, there are several tests, upper GI, upper endoscopy, 24 hour PH manometry.  IF you have gastroparesis, the medicine, Reglan can help.  Good luck!\",\n",

My surgeon said that they just released a study that shows that excessive or improper lifting can cause the nissen wrap to slip.

I have not been able to get the symptoms under control with medications. My surgeon will not do a third nissen procedure as he feels that with my asthma, and the hard cough I get, that the nissen wrap would eventually fail again.  He has come up with an alternate surgery he believes changes the success rate for the rest of my life from 30 % to 90 %.

I also felt an \"awareness\" of pressure in the upper left quadrant of my abdomen. So, a couple of weeks after my trip to the hospital I went back to the doctor and he prescribed doxycycline for a supposed sinus infection. Anyways, for four months I passed stools that were yellowish brown - lighter than usual, but not pale or clay-colored. Lately - for the past two weeks - I have been taking large doses of acidophilous (sp.?) and have not been eating gluten or dairy products. My stool is significantly darker, but looser. I am worried about fecal fat or malabsorbsion. However, I have not had stools that float during this episode. I have not lost any weight during this period, but I feel I have not been getting all the nutrients from the food I have been eating.

I have also been taking a pancreatic digestive supplement found at the health food store and the gas and bloating and heartburn is GONE.  Now, I can\\'t stop eating, because nothing bothers me anymore.

I hope this helps.\\nYou find magnesium supplements in the same aisle you would find vitamins.

I also think that the many years of using ppi\\'s to reduce acid was a major factor in all of my problems.  the medicine reduced the amount of acid your stomach produces and then your food can\\'t breakdown, then you get heartburn, bloated and gassy from the food backing up and take more antacids.  It\\'s a cycle, the supplements help so much it\\'s incredible. They help to activate digestive enzymes and breakdown your food.

Look at the label.  That\\'s why it\\'s makes more sense to just take the supplement to cut the neutralize the acid. If I have said it once I will say it again.   Those acid reducers are the problem.  You need acid to digest your food.  Without it we get more heartburn and more gas.  It has worked wonders for me.  you\\'ll see.\\nHarry,\\nThis whole \"illness thing\" has really turned me on to homeopathic medicine too.  I have been seeing doctors for years with no good advice.  They prescribe more acid reducers and I thought I\\'ve been on Prilosec, tagamet, zantac, prevacid, aciphex and nexium and STILL have heartburn, is this how I\\'m going to have to live the rest of my life and I\\'m only in my early 30\\'s. They are only masking the illness by treating the symptoms but not getting to the root of the problem.  I\\'ll still go to the doctor, but I know to educate myself if I really want to feel better.\\nBluepumkin,\\nThanks for replying. I agree with what you said about acid reducers. That\\'s just why I didn\\'t fill my prescription for them. Instead, I am trying CidaBan DGL\\nwhich is a dietary supplement for indigestion and heartburn. The key ingredient is licorice root. If this doesn\\'t work, I will try magnesium.  Thanks for sharing.\\nHi\\nThank you for your\"e reply I think I will try your advise.Mine just seemed to have gotten worse over the last 2 months. I think the Nexium was making me worse.I think I have a new ang different pain every day .Thanks again I\\'ll let you know how things go,\\nBluepumpkin,\\nI have been suffering with the exact same thing as you (symptoms). Have had numerous tests and blood work-ups. I have been dealing w/ Gastro. doc and most recently a surgeon (hiatal hernia/gallbladder??). I have taken Protonix (did NOTHING), Donotol Extendtabs (abdominal spasms) and most recently Nexium which after 2 days I quit as I was so sick I couldn\\'t get out of bed !\\nHarry (member here) suggested on Saturday a.m. that I get \"Magnesium Phosphorica\" @ the health food store. I immediately went there (desperate for some sort of pain relief) and got a bottle. They are tiny little round pellets. The clerk told me to put 3/5 under my tongue, 3 times per day (they taste like sugar pills).\\nApparently they are very popular according to the clerk. It says on the bottle, for abdominal spasms.\\nI responded w/ a post to Harry yesterday morning expessing my gratitude for recomending them as I was ALREADY feeling better ! I have been using them since and I have to say I agree w/ your comments, I am feeling SO MUCH BETTER !!!  I am still cautious to eat as it has been sooooooo long that I\\'ve been afraid of what and what not to eat for fear of increasing my pain. I\\'m beginning to feel like my old self again, doing household chores and normal everyday activities that last week I wouldn\\'t think of attempting to do !!\\nI am not 100% but I am feeling the best I\\'ve felt in a long, long time ! I\\'m still taking my script for Donotol Extendtabs also.\\nBronti,\\nI couldn\\'t find the kind you put under your tongue so I got the magnesium pills, and they both seem to work just the same.  I am so happy to hear of another person who has found relief from this phantom illness.  I can\\'t even begin to describe the pain I was in.  I\\'m sure you already know. The doctors thought I was crazy because all of my tests came back negative.  I think the PPI\\'s have a lot to do with the spasms, because now that I\\'ve quit taking all prescribed medicine I feel a lot better.\\nsounds great,now what im wondering is how do probiotics work into all of this? is it somethign we can stop taking or take them along with the magnesium ? and is this helpful with the gas and bloating from IBS ?\\n\\n[This message has been edited by EchoeB42 (edited 09-29-2003).]',\n",

Sure enough, i had a good size polyp (benign) they found.  DON'T assume things are better.  The colonoscopy itself was a breeze, it's the stuff you have to drink BEFORE that's the hardest.

I went to the doctor because although I have never been regular with periods lately it is around 6-7 months between them and I am in a lot of pain inbetween them. I had some tests ran and found that I have a slow Thryoid and PCOS. My doctor said that unless I wanted to have more children I needed to do nothing but he isn't living in pain and dealing with all the side effects. I am looking for Helpful information from anyone willing to write.All my friends are young and still dealing with toddlers not Menopause they just don't seem to connect with me on this subject and it is a little hard to talk to them about Hair growth, extreme weight gain in the last year ,the ungodly acne that I never had in my life and the mood swings from ---- I have two young children that seem to set me off very easy. Plus lack of sleep from both Insomnia and Children getting up in the middle of the night...In great need of Helpful advice. I know that there has to be something out there to help me the doctor said that eventually when I can't take the pain I will have to have a Complete Hysterectomy but I just can't even comprohend that extreme of advice when I am so young....HELP\\n\\n------------------\\nTracey\\nYour doctor needs to consider doing more for you right now.  If you are expereriencing things like the insomnia etc then he should give you something to help you with those problems.  As for having a hysterectomy at a young age..........I can't comment much on that since I am not in your situation but I would think that if the problems are bad enough that the benefits of a hysterectomy would outweigh the pain etc you are feeling now.  As for the acne that can be controlled with antibiotics until you get it under control.  If your doctor isn't willing to work with you on these issues then find someone who is willing to help you.\\nThanks for the advice I am currently looking for another doctor and also looking for some information on herbal/natural treatments , possibly even a dietician to help me with proper nutrition. Hoping that some of these changes could possible help some of the symtoms that I am feeling. I am really just trying to get overall information so I can make the right choices. It is just hard because even if woman my age are having these problems they aren't talking about it and I haven't been able to find a whole lot of information out there about it.

Two questions....1.) Has anyone here ever had them, and if so how long did it take you to recover and feel better.  The Doc told me overnight, but two days later, I\\'m still tired and crampy.  I\\'m not sure if I\\'m being impatient.  2.) Does anyone know if they will affect my already difficult fertility issues in the future?  I know getting rid of the polyps will help, but I don\\'t know if they leave scar tissue inside my uterus and make it hard for an embryo to \"plant\" itself. 3.) Also, does anyone know if they are prone to return?\\nSorry, that\\'s three questions.

       " {'post': 'I would just like to know what symptoms everyone has on the board who have PCOS.\\n\\nAnd everyone who is taking treatment how long have you been on treatment and around how much everything was because I am afraid I will not be able to afford everything?  And How much does insurance cover?\\n\\n\\nFor last 4yrs i was having slightly irregular periods i.e 2-3 times in a year i used to miss them. This was very unsual for me as i had very regular one.My docs said that was Ok.For last 2yrs i am trying to conceive but in vain.All my blood test ,Lap. etc were perfect.So I was told that missing periods 2-3 in a year is ok.Last week i consulted an RE.He did Trans-vaginal u/s and diagnosed me of very mild PCOS.So after 4 yrs i came to know my problem.At present i am on clomid.My insurance company covers everything including medicines......so dont know about the costs. I didnot have any symptoms except for the above mentioned.My RE told that seeing your charts everything is perfect.So he decided to keep aside my reports and do U/S which revealed the presence of very few minor cysts on the ovary thus falling in the catogory of mild PCOS.\\nHope it helps..\\nI was undiagnosed with PCOS for 1 1/12 year and I had all the symptoms on the book!!\\nI gained 30 pounds without changing my diet, and even though I exercised a lot I just didn´t lose any weight.  I had mood swings, very irregular periods (30-90 days cycles) and when AF finally showed up, it stayed for a month (sometimes). No ovulation.  I craved foods that I don´t even like (i.e, cookies), had a lot of facial hair (above and under the lips), fat around the waist line (love handles), and that´s all I can remember right now...\\n\\nMy GYN put me on clomid for 7 cycles, but I ovulated only once.  Then a RE put me on Met 2000mg/daily and I got pg in 3 months, but I m/c. Took a 3 months break and then got pg and m/c again.  Now, I have been on Glucophage XR for almost a year, and I ovulate on my own, have 30 days cycles, lost 25 pounds, and I just have mood swing and PMS symptoms 1 week b4 AF.\\n\\nAs for price, Met was cheaper ($10 copay for a 30 days supply) than Gluco XR, but I had TERRIBLE side effects...after Gluco XR, the side effects were gone.  Now I pay $40 for a 90 days sypply at [url=\"http://www.medcohealth.com,\"]www.medcohealth.com,[/url]  and my insurance is United Healthcare.\\n\\nOn another PCOS list, I have heard of people buying these medicines online on international site cuz it´s cheaper.  Also, I´ve heard about sites that give these medicines for free for those who can´t afford it.  But I don´t know if it is true or how it works.\\n\\nMinouche\\nI forgot to mention that I have been TTC for 4 years and that the ovulation/pregnancy test kits are not covered by the insurance nor spending account.\\nHi PLM,\\n\\nI have PCOS and I\\'m not insulin resistant.  My u/s ususally show many small cysts.  I might have two periods a year on my own and I do not ovulate on a regular basis.  My doctor has told me that my androgen levels (male hormones) are high.  I have a little bit of excessive hair on my belly and feet. However, I\\'m lucky that my facial hair is very blond and you can\\'t tell that I have it.  I am overweight, and when I\\'m not on fertiltiy meds, I have some hair loss.\\n\\nWith my old doc, I paid about $50/month of 100 mg of clomid, $95 for progesterone tests, and $360 for ultrasounds. My first IUI (artifical insemination) cost $307. I discovered that if I asked my doctor to schedule a pg test at the same time of the progeterone test, that insurance will pay for it.  Also, with my old doc, I had to take ODK tests.  I paid about $13 for 7 Clear Plan Easy.  Recently, I started a new RE. His office will let me pay insurance negotitated rates if I pay day of service.  This will reduce my IUIs to about $120 and U/S to about $180.  The sprem wash will still be $240.  Another thing that I\\'m learning it to ask you doc to make sure the insurance company realizes when procedures are diagnostic in nature.  My insurance pays for all dianotstic tests.\\n\\nMindy\\nHi,\\n\\nI too have the symptoms the rest of the girls have.  Are you ttc or are you looking for treatment of pcos?\\n\\nSymptoms:  Weight gain 50 lbs in a year without changing anything, facial hair, irregular periods - I would go months without one and then have one for 30 - 60 days.\\n\\nDiagnosis - I went to 3 different MD\\'s before being diagnosed.  Finally the last one only talked to me and said he thought I had PCOS.  He put me on Glucophage (metformin) and I began 28 day cycles.  2 months later did a laparoscopy to confirm PCOS.  You can be diagnosed with a trans-vaginal ultrasound if you have a good tech who knows what they are looking for \"ring of pearls\" and if they have good equipment.\\n\\nAs far as getting pg, we had tried for 7-8 years before we got pg, and we now have a wonderful son who just turned 2.  I was not able to continue with the MD who put me on Glucophage because of Insurance Change, but my regular MD let me continue it since it was keeping my periods regular, 6 months later we had a positive pregnancy test.\\n\\nAs far as insurance goes, if they do not cover infertility (and most don\\'t) you may want to go to the MD and tell them you have been \"chating\" with other women and think you may have PCOS, but to please not diagnose it as infertility.  I\\'m not trying to be dishonest with the insurance company, but PCOS causes infertility, but even if you were not trying to get pregnant they would cover it as just PCOS.\\n\\nIf you have any more ??? let us know.\\n\\nI\\'ve never been regular. When I was a teenager, I had 2-3 periods a year. My mom didn\\'t think anything of it because she was the same way and after she had me never had a problem again. By the time I got to college, I gained 55 pounds without changing my eating habits (actually was eating more fruits and less potato chips and pizza) and with the addition of all the walking I had to do around campus. I went to a dr because by this time my periods had disappeared completely. She laughed when I told her about the weight gain. I told her that it felt like when I had PMS I would get bloated, but then never lost that bloated weight. It just kept compounding. She told me I was out of my head and that I just ate too much. She put me on the pill and I stayed on it because it gave me regular periods with very little cramping.\\n\\nWhen I got a real job at 25 with health insurance, I went to a dr (by then I was living in a different state) for my initial exam. She took blood tests and was alarmed at how high my cholesterol was. She referred me to an RE, though at that time I wasn\\'t sure why. The RE (and this is through an HMO) did more blood tests and confirmed that I had PCOS, a disease I\\'d never heard of before. He said my cholesterol (the good cholesterol) was off the charts, but not to worry because that was not going to change. He said it was a manifestation of the PCOS and that he could put me on meds and a strict diet and I likely would not see much improvement with the numbers. My \"bad\" cholesterol was very low.\\n\\nLong story short (too late!) My other symptoms were VERY high androgen levels and very low levels of most other hormones. No periods since age 18 (without meds) horrible facial hair (though I\\'m Italian, so it could also be genes), hair in other embarrassing places, weight gain.\\n\\nThe only thing  I took for it was birth control, but went off that for when I started ttc. I now take provera to induce periods in order to start a new cycle.\\n\\nHope that helps.\\nI am ttc, and I don\\'t know yet if I have pcos but I think that my symptoms are close enough.  I went to planned parenthood and took blood work but I have to wait untill my doc. appt at the end of the month. I really feel like I am being left behind becasue left and right everyone is having a baby.  Every week I have heard someone else having a baby.  Or becoming pregnant.  My husband already has a baby so he is not that worried but I am starting to feel so incomplete I hope I don\\'t have anything wrong with me, the chances are slim to none.\\n\\nplm---\\n\\nI am so happy for everyone having babies but I get so jealous deep down inside.  Can any one else relate?\\nplm,\\n\\nI know exactly how you feel.  In January I found out that my brother\\'s girlfriend was pregnant and they kept it a secret from me because I have been ttc for over a year and it was an oops for them!!  I was happy that I was going to be an aunt, but also deep inside I was thinking why not me?  I also have PCOS and on Clomid.  I took metformin for a month, but I could not handle the side effects.\\n\\nDon\\'t feel too bad, just remember there are tons of us out here and we are all in the same boat!!\\n\\nJody\\n\\n------------------\\nBaby Dust To All!!!\\nThere are many comments on everyone\\'s post that I want to reply to.\\n\\nTo PLM - Most people here can relate to the jealousy you feel.  We dicuss it often.  Last October, my baby sister annonced she was pregnant.  Even though I was very happy for her, I was jealous too. I was sort of glad that I didn\\'t attend the family gathering that night where she made the announcement because I\\'m sure even emotion in the book went through my head and was displayed on my face that night.  However, I love being an aunt (my other sister has three girls) and the baby is due in the next 2-4 weeks.  It will be my first nephew.  The jealousy is gone and now I\\'m just plain excited.\\n\\nI do get a little scared that when I hold him for the first time that I might get very weepy.  I\\'ll have to make sure I\\'m not on any hormones pills when he\\'s born. That will just make the situation tougher. lol\\n\\n\\nTo everyone who has had success in restoring her period with glucophage (metformin), Thank you for sharing your successes.  I can\\'t stand taking the medicine because I either feel like throwing up or having diarehha.  Your success keeps me focued on taking them.  However, the next time I go to the doctor, I\\'m going to ask for Glucophage XR or something like that.  I think it\\'s time released and someone said the side affects aren\\'t as bad.\\n\\n\\nRegarding insurance and glucophage, my insurance doesn\\'t pay for ovulation stimulation medication, however it does pay for glucophage (metformin).  It\\'s the only thing I haven\\'t had to fight the insurance company for.\\n\\n\\nFinally, I want to comment on being diagnosed with PCOS.  My diagnosis happened quickly once I went to the doctor to get help with ttc.  I saw an ob/gyn who had been doing infertility treatements for many years.  It was very evident on the u/s.  I think, we on this board, need to recommend to people who want to find out if they have PCOS to see an RE or ob/gyn who has a long history with infertilty immediately.   I have found my family doctors are not really familiar with this syndrome.\\n\\nMindy\\n\\nFor those who have a lot of side effects, please change to Glucophage XR immediately!!! I still have some side effects once in a while, but nothing compared to what I\\'ve had with Metformin.  Believe me, they are made of same agent, but the side effects are very different!\\n\\nI don\\'t get jealous when I hear someone close to me is pregnant, but I do feel like if they were \"cutting\" on the line and I am left behind\\n\\n\\noh well, I try to focus on the advances that I already made with my infertility treatment...get a period regularly, ovulate on my own, and feel emotionally better (no mood swings!!!\\n)..\\n\\n\"Cutting in front of you in line\" is a good description Minouche.  I think that more accurately describes how I feel that jealousy.\\n\\nYour comment about advances in you infertility caused me to remember the first 6-12 months when I was ttc.  The rollercoaster didn\\'t seem to be as high back then because I was elated that my body seem to operating more normally with ovulation and periods.  The next time I\\'m down, I\\'ll try to get myself to remember that I\\'m further ahead than before I saw an RE.\\n\\nThanks,\\nMindy\\neveryone\\'s words are great becasue I feel better just reading about everyone.  I try to speak to my husband but he does not understand he just tells me it is not my time and he is very optimistic and it makes me want to kiss him and hit him at the same time.  My brother is having a bay and it is no planned and he is young but I pray that everything will be O.K.  Everything does happen for a reason. I try to focus my attention on other things but it seems like every magazine, all over tv and all over the place is about mother\\'s and children and babies.  In spite of everything I will be O.K and I want to start thinking more positive and no matter what I will have a healthy bouncing baby when the time is right.  I am very thankful for this board.\\n\\nBaby dust to all -- and to me\\nIs PCOS similar in anyway to high FSH level?\\nI had my first test done and my FSH came back at 19.2 . I was told it is high for my age (35) and that it will be difficult for me to get pregnant.\\nDo you have any advice?\\nI have PCOS. I only ovulate about 5 times per year. Sometimes I have mild breakouts, sometimes my skin is clear as a bell.  Also, I am overweight somewhat, but not \"around the middle\" which is typical with PCOS patients.\\n\\nI take Glucophage XR 2000mg/day (4 pills). It has not done a thing to help regulate my periods b/c I am not insulin resistant, but the endo wants to keep me on it anyway. The cost is $8 for a three month supply with my insurance copay, I am not sure what the retail price is.',\n",

       " {'post': 'I\\'m not even sure where to begin. I\\'m 22 and ever since I was 12 I\\'ve had abnormal periods. I would have my period for 6 months non-stop and then not have it for 8 months. I was diagnosed with PCOP at the age of 15 and was put on birth control. I was always a heavy teenager but as soon as I started taking the pill I put on about 40lbs within a matter of months. I also had terrible side effects from taking the pill which i would bring up with my doc. I must have gone through about 6 different kinds of bcp and each time I\\'d switch I\\'d gain more weight. I was on the pill from the age of 15 to 19 until one morning I got on the scale and my weight was almost 250lbs and I\\'m 5\\'4. That day I took myself off the pill and put myself on a diet. I\\'d excersice daily, eat right and the weight started coming off and my periods became very regular. For almost 2 years I knew exactly when my period was coming, it was less painful and would last 5-6 days. I was in heaven. In 12 months I managed to go from 250lbs to 105lbs and I did it the healthy way. I never took any pills or did anything drastic. I never starved myself and my doctors were amazed. I\\'ve maintained my weight for 2 years now and everything was fine until this past may when I skipped my period by a month. Last month my period came on the 15th and now I\\'m 2 days late. I know 2 days is not much but I\\'m worried that the problem is starting again. I plan on waiting a few more days and if my period doesn\\'t come going to see my doc. I\\'m just scared that i\\'ll have to go back on the pill. I\\'ve worked so hard on keeping the weight off only to have it come back.\\n\\nAny advice?\\nI stress myself out once a month because my period is never on schedule.  I get scared then over time a little excited.  Then it comes and I prepare for the next month.  Last month, my period was nine days late.  I am due any day now.  I choose to stay off birth control.  You should do what you feel is right.\\nPersonally, I love using the pill to regulate my periods.  I never had a normal one on my own....the doctors have no idea why, but because I have no weight gain, no excess hair, nothing on my ovaries, and all normal hormone levels, they think it must be some sort of minute hormone release that is faulty and is not allowing me to ovulate.  I\\'ve been taking the pill since I was 16 (I\\'m 24 now) and love being able to predict and alter when I have periods.  I have had three separate doctors (two gynos and a reproductive endocrinologist) tell me this is the right course for ME.\\n\\nHowever, the pill and the PCOS are obviously effecting your body in a severe way.  Kudos to you for the way you lost so much weight....that is so impressive and is truly something to be lauded for!!  I would consult specialists, if possible, and see why your body is responding in this way.  Maybe birth control is NOT the right option for you, but there may be other treatments out there.  Do your homework and talk to as many people as possible....but be careful!  This is nothing to take lightly.  Best wishes.\\nDID you actually have a scan to determin pcos? and blood tests for your testerone? and also have you got any abnormal hair growth? the pill is rubbish for pcos all id does is make you put on weight which is not what should happen with pcos as the sugar in your body feeds the cysts, and also the pill just regulates your periods, i take metformin which is one that is used, as people with pcos and who are overweight got type 2 diabeties, it helps break down the sugar and helps you loose weight and at the same time helps pop those cysts and regulate your periods..\\n\\n------------------\\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\nlook into the herb \\'vitex\\'\\nThank you so much to all of you that have responded. I\\'ve actually done some research these last couple of days and am shocked that I was never properly diagnosed with pcop. When my periods would not stop my mother took me to a see a GYN who asked me what the problem was. When I told him what was going on (period would not stop for months) he diagnosed me with pcop. He said that since my periods were irregular, I was chubby has some facial hair that pcop was the problem and right away put me on birth control. Since then I\\'ve been to a couple of other gyn doctors and no one has ever bothered to give me a blood test to check my hormone levels. I never bothered to research the topic myself because I had full faith in my doctors. The only reason I became concerned now is because I still haven\\'t gotten my period. I am so grateful to you all for all the information you have given and I\\'m so mad at myself and my doctors. All these years I thought I had pcop when in fact it could be something completly different!!\\nWell if i was you, i would dmeand a blood test for tesosterone and a scan to see whats going on inside you? geeez.. doctors get right on my nerves sometimes.Good luck\\n\\n------------------\\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\nFYI...there is a new push in the medical community (according to my RE) to stop calling PCOS PCOS and instead call it \"METABOLIC DISORDER.\"  Why?  Because not all women with PCOS have polycystic ovaries.  It\\'s a common symptom...but not present 100% of the time.  Also, testosterone may not always be significantly elavated (although it is in my case).  PCOS is usually diagnosed when a series of symptoms are found together...but they may be different symptoms for every woman.  \"Estrogen Dominance\" may also play a key role.\\n\\nPS...vitex would certainly be a good supplement to add to your treatment regimen (anything\\'s better than bcp\\'s!!!).  Also, consider applying natural progesterone cream for two weeks a month.\\n\\n',\n",

       " {'post': \"If PCOSers are set up naturally to overstimulate with gonadotropins, then why would a dr. put someone with PCOS on a higher dose than one would normally start at?\\nMost people start on 75 ml, while my dr. is starting me on 112.5 mls.  I am just so scared that this cycle will fail for producing too many follies we just can't afford it financially.\\n\\nAnyhow, any advice would be great.\\n\\nThanks\\nRose\\nI am not sure how to answer your question about WHY doctors put women with PCOS on injectibles. However, I do know that women with PCOS who do injectibles have been very successful.\\nUnfortunately for me, I did injectibles (75ml) and I DID NOT overstimulate, However, I did not get pregnant either. So, I guess I was just unlucky on my first try at getting pregnant. But was pleased my cycle was not cancelled. Our insurance did not cover it, either. It is really difficult that is why we have taken a 2- month break. If I don't get pregnant by September, then I will do injectibles again.\\nI hope this helps and good luck. Remember that while on injectibles, they monitor you VERY closely and can adjust your dosage along the way.\\nGood luck to you!!!!\\nPam\\nI wish I had known as much as you do.  I would talk to my dr. if I were you to be sure.  My dr. put me on 150 of repronex and i produced 18 mature follies and went close to hyperstimulation.  We had to cancel my cycle and we were out the $ we spent on the injectibles.  Over $1000.  Plus all of those shots in my rear were for nothing.  I'd definitely double check with him.  My dr explained (AFTER I had 18 mature follies) that this happens with PCOS patients, that we stimulate easy.  Well why didn't they think about that in the first place?  And what about all of those u/s and lab work?  I was pretty upset at having to cancel that cycle.  For this cycle, though, he cut the dose in half and then upped it a little half way through.  I only had two mature follies.  I go for the blood test on Monday.  If it's a BFN I'm going to make sure I talk to the dr more and tell him my concerns as they come up.  Injectibles are expensive.  I hope this helps.\\n\\nGood luck!\\nThanks Suki and Adkins for your reply.\\nI feel that being informed is empowering.  It sorta gives me a false sense of control. LOL!!!\\nAnyhow, I realize that they do monitor you closely, and I go back on day 9 which is Saturday.  I hope that everything will be alright.\\n\\nThanks again,\\nRose\\nOMG, 18 follicles\\n\\n\\nI have PCOS and I've done four cycles with injectibles (follistim). They had my dosage up to 4 amps (300 UI) daily. One cycle I had 2 follicles, the other 3 I only had one.\\n\\nJust make sure they have you going in for u/s every couple days so they can adjust the dosage if necessary. Good luck!!\\n\\n~ Joelle\\nI'm at the end of my second IUI with injectibles (Gonal-F) and I too have PCOS.  My first cycle they put me at a fairly low dose, 112.5, and I had two follies, but that round failed.  This time around, they tried a higher dose, 150, to give me more follies and a better chance, but I overstimulated.  They monitored me really closely--brought me in every single day for six days for b/w and u/s!  Even though they cut my dose back to 75,  I had so many follies at once that my RE gave me a choice between cancelling the cycle outright or ovulating me a day early.  Because the follies weren't quite mature, it was less likely that this cycle would work, but it gave me some chance as opposed to totally cancelling the cycle.\\nThe overstimulation happened to me my very first cycle of injectibles with DD back in '98. I was given the option of cancelling or going in and retrieving the eggs for a future cycle if I ever needed to do IVF.  I chose to cancel, being that it was my first try ever and the thought kind of freaked me out a little.  I felt I wanted to try more on my own, and at that time, it happened to work out, as I got pregnant on my next cycle. That might be an option for some people, though, to harvest from an overstimulated IUI cycle, as it seems as more people are trying IVF these days-it would be one step and one expense out of the way. Good luck.\\nHey Octobergirl!  I asked if they could harvest the eggs and that we could switch to IVF but they said no b/c I hadn't gone through the proper paperwork, etc.  I didn't think about harvesting them for a later cycle.  Good thinking.  If the next cycle (let's hope there's not one) produces too many, then I'm going talk to them about that!  Thanks for the idea!\\nThanks for all your replies.\\nI think the other thing that's got me a little freaked out is when they did the first ultrasound (on day 2) I had 18 follies forming on one side and 23 the other.  No clue if that's normal or what.  I never ovulate and never have periods on my own.  I'm hoping that's normal.\\nAnyhow, that's a really good idea to harvest the eggs in case of IVF.  Never thought of that. I'll have to inquire to see if that's possible.\\nAs far as going in every other day, they're not doing that until day 9 which is Saturday.  So from day 5-9 I'm on 112.5.  I need to put more faith in them I guess, but this is my first experience with them and so far I don't have a very good feeling.  I called 2 days ago to make sure that I was going to be taking the proper dose, and they have never called me back.  That doesn't leave me with a very good feeling, plus on top of that, our first visit they told us that the doctors know us on paper only and that we will be dealing with their nurse coordinator 99% of the time.  It's bad enough I have to travel 3 1/2 hours to this clinic and it's the closest one.\\nAnyhow thanks for letting me vent.\\nAnd thanks for the advice.  I really appreciate the support.\\n\\nRose\\nsorry- what is PCOS?\\nllama mamma,\\nPCOS is polycystic ovarian syndrome\\nIt's millions of cysts on the ovaries than inhibit ovulation and cause all kinds of other nasty side effects.\\nTake care,\\n\\nRose\",\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi, I'm 21, and I started my period when I was 17.  My periods have never been regular. I figured that it would just take a little time for them to regulate, since I was a late bloomer and all. This year though, I've had more periods, and they've seemed to be coming more often, anywhere between every 30-40 days. Until August. August 4th was the end of my last period, and at the end of August, I lost my virginity. I've been sexually active since then, and I've also not had a period. I've taken several pregnancy tests (which were negative), and I've even visited the doctor, who has confirmed that I am not pregnant. He prescribed a progestin (medroproxyr) for me to take for 10 days, which I thought was supposed to make me bleed, but did not, and he also put me on birth control pills. I've read that when a girl has sex for the first time, it could cause her to not have her period for up to 3 months, so I thought that that could have something to do with my period being so late. But, my doctor said that having sex does not affect your period unless you are pregnant. He suggested that I may have polycystic ovarian syndrome.\\n\\n\\nThe thought of having PCOS is frightening to me because I'm afraid that I may not be able to have children. I'm still waiting on the test results, and Monday I have to go and have my blood drawn so that they can test my insulin level. I am by no means overweight, nor do I have any excess hair, pain during menstruation or any other symptoms that I have read about.  The only symptoms I seem to have are irregular periods, and acne/oily skin.  I was just wondering, what are your thoughts on this? Does it sound like I may have PCOS? Or does losing your virginity really affect your menstruation? Any comments are greatly appreciated. Thanks~\\nHi, I have pcos - and it doesn't stop you having children, so don't worry, Victoria Beckham has it and she has two healthy kids. But pcos can take many forms, I am not hairy, nor do I have acne, I have regular periods too, but I am overweight. Make sure you are eating right, stay off fizzy drinks and sugar, getting enough excercise and generally keeping healthy. You should get your insulin checked, along with other things.\\n\\nHaving sex does not stop your period, unless you get pregnant, so that isn't an issue.  If you only started your periods at 17, that's quite late and it took me many years for mine to regulate.\\n\\nRemember everyone is different, just becuase you don't conform doesn't mean there's something wrong with you. Don't be scared, get yourself thoroughly checked out and GOOD LUCK.\\nThanks, you've really made me feel alot better!\",\n",

It is not unusual for the need to increase.\\nThere are many factors that affect thyroid and even diet does.\\nI suggest the book, The Thyroid Solution, for lots of info of what you can do for yourself, and thyroid information in general.\",\n",

How are they treated differently?\\n\\nI thought that with being blood tested hyper and Graves that this was the cause of my eye symptons. And that treating the Graves will help the symptons, including the protruding eyes and lid retraction.\\n\\nCan  someone clear things up?\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nPat\\nPat,  Sorry I don\\'t know much on this subject though I did see some information on <A HREF=\"http://www.about.com.\" TARGET=_blank>www.about.com.</A>   Let us know what you find out. I thought it would be resolved the eyes once your thyroid was regulated too.\\nThyroid Eye Disease \"TED\" is different than Graves\\' disease.  They are related and people with Graves\\' disease and Hashimoto\\'s disease are who are most likely to get it.  I\\'m hyper and my doctor measured my eyes to be sure they were okay.  She also said TED is more common is smokers.  Since they are both autoimmune diseases and related sometimes the treatment for hyper will help the eyes too.\\nGraves is an autoimmune thyroid disease.  It\\'s confusing because most of us with Graves consider the thyroid to be the \"problem\".  But with Graves, yes the thryoid needs to be treated, but the underlying problem is antibodies.  Antibodies attack the thyroid gland and cause it to overproduce thyroid hormone.  TED is a seperate issue where the antibodies attack the tissues/muscles of the eyes.  One can have either condition independently of the other or have both at the same time.  The antibodies can also (rarely) attack the skin of the front of your shins, this is called pretibial myxedema.  Nobody knows what causes these antibodies to do any of this and there is no treatment to get rid of the antibodies.

If a hypothyroid person gains weight from being hypo and their metabolism is slowed down by the malfunctioning thyroid, when the person is on the right thyroid med at the right dosage, WOULDN\\'T THAT PERSON\\'S METABOLISM SPEED UP AND THE PERSON LOSE WEIGHT???\\n\\nI mean, it only makes sense.  But time after time, I keep reading all of these posts of people saying that even though they\\'re on the right thyroid med, they\\'re still overweight and their metabolism is still slow.\\n\\nThen I read posts by people who self-medicate to get their thyroid hyper and they lose crazy weight.  My simple question is, does a person have to self-medicate (which I know they shouldn\\'t do) in order to lose weight?\\n\\nI used to be super hyperthyroid (85 pounds at 5\\'3\"), and now I am hypo (141 pounds literally overnight).  I have every hypo symptom, and I\\'m about to see my general doc in order to be referred to a specialist *sigh*.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I\\'d be happy to just be at 115 pounds and COMFORTABLE.  I am so fat now!  I have zipper marks on my stomach from my jeans cutting off my circulation.  I want to cry.\\n\\nBut forget all of this jibberish.  I\\'m just trying to give some background on my condition before I ask, doesn\\'t ANYONE lose weight simply by their metabolism speeding up on thyroid medication?  Can\\'t a doctor put you at the right level where you\\'re not so sluggish and looking pudgy?\\n\\nAlso, I read on the Internet that some bodybuilders use Cytomel to lose sudden and drastic weight before a competition.  Of course they get this drug illegally and without a prescription.  What does Cytomel do?  And do you take it in addition to a drug like Synthroid or Levothroid?\\n\\nAnyone who has lost weight simply by being on a thyroid med, please explain in detail your formula, and why it worked for you.  And also, can someone brief me on Cytomel?  Thanks!\\nNever take more synthroid then you supposed to.  It can be very bad for you.\\n\\nI didn\\'t take my synthroid for several months.  I ended up gaining weight but as soon as I started taking my synthroid again I lost all the weight.  So if your calorie intact is what it should be for your height you will loss the weight once your thyroxine levels are back to normal.  I lost the weight rather quickly.  It took about a week.  But that isn\\'t safe either.  I have type 1 diabetes so that might explain why I lost the weight so quickly.\\n\\n<B>-Mark</B><p>[This message has been edited by PlaXibo (edited 02-27-2001).]\\nMark is correct that taking more thyroid\\nthan prescribed is a huge risk. Over working the heart makes the heart enlarged and can cause irreversable damage/heart attacks.\\nPlease don\\'t even think of it...there are no viable short cuts to weight loss! It can be hard work and requires persistence!\\n\\nFrom what I understand, when one has been un/undertreated for hypothyroidism for years and has lowered metabolism, weight gain, and muscle tone loss, simply taking the medication will not suffienctly raise the metabolism to cause weight loss.\\nWhat it does is allow the healing to occur so that these factors can be changed, whereas before they probably could not be changed. For instance, one can now build muscle tone, which is what raises the metabolism and uses up excess fat.\\n\\nIf the hypothyroid state is discovered and treated before too much muscle tone is lost, then yes, correcting the thyroid balance will result in going back to the normal weight, usually. There is no way for me to know how much muscle tone anyone already had, though.\\n\\nI know for myself, one can be slender appearing and have little muscle tone, with a high body fat percentage. The fat is then thruout the muscles and one is not really lean. Then when one gains weight, it is evrywhere and takes time and hard work to get rid of.  I was untreated for many years, gained about 80 excess pounds and lost most of my muscle tone. I was incapacitated by it, but now my muscles will tone. They are so out of tone, this is going to take awhile. So I have to be patient and persistent! It is the rebuilding of muscle tone that will create the use of the excess fat storage. I have to do the work of toning myself!\\nBut, with the thyroid med, I now have the energy to pursue the muscle building!\\n\\nWhat I do is avoid dieting and think instead about life-style changes. Diets are temporary, but life-style changes can last.\\nIf I think I am depriving myself, that never lasts! So I eat some sugary foods occasionally, but a lot less, and I focus on eating more appropriate foods as much as possible. It is slower...but think of this, the excess skin has time to shrink along with the fat cells!\\n\\nRemember stored fat is a living body organ and has a purpose. It is not like the fat we trim off a dead steak. We need to USE it up!\\n\\nI hope this helps some in the frustrating fat loss journey! TF\\nThanks, Tree Frog!  I see you are a very wonderful addition to this board -- very helpful!  I appreciate it.\\n\\nDo you know anything about Cytomel?\\nCytomel is T3.  Synthroid is T4  Natrual throid is a mixture of T4/T3 (80-20).  There are articles on <A HREF=\"http://www.about.com\" TARGET=_blank>www.about.com</A>  on adding T3.  There are references in \"THe Thyroid Solution\" about T3 and its effect with depression, weight loss, PMS...  Good book  Also it guides you on the vitamans you need the food to avoid and why exercise is good for you both areobics and yoga types.  I have lost weight while on synthroid right after my first was born I got back down to the pre-pregnancy weight before I conceved the 2nd.  It is possible to lose weight while your leveled and you need not over dose\\nThanks, ser.  That was the exact info I needed.\\nFirst, don\\'t EVER go off your thyroid med unless your doctor instructs you to.  My husband was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid, put on synthroid then decide he did\\'nt need it anymore after about 8 months.  I asked my doctor what could happen and she said if a thyroid problem goes unchecked it can lead to congestive heart failure.  MEN!! Second, I am hypo-thyroid and on Synthroid.  I\\'m 5-3/12 and now 118 pounds.  I was up to 128.  I have been thin all my life. The only time I put weight on was with my pregnancies, so the 128 was uncomfortable.  I decided to start walking and drinking lots of water, and really watching what I ate.  Alot of salads for lunch and fruits, and just smaller portions of meals.  And limiting your sweets. It can be done, you just have to WANT to loose the weight.  Good luck..\\nHello! I was on the old board and it is amazing that our thyroids are still running and in some cases ruining our lives.

I don\\'t mean to upset you but I am the opposite I went down to 100 when I was diagnosed with Graves Disease...after taking RAI & going hypo I am still 100 lbs.

My sister in law on the other hand has the exact opposite problem & for 7 years hasn\\'t been able to lose weight. So...chances are even by doubling your dose it will not cause you to lose weight but it could & I\\'m sure would cause serious & possibly permanant damage to your body even possibly death. I know that a lot of people who are extremely overweight & have dieted...changed eating habits...exercised etc...still could not lose weight but did after their stomach stapled. Example is Carnie Wilson from Wilson Philips the singing group. I know that sounds drastic but it sure beats killing yourself.

She has ordered a thyroid scan for this week. Of course I agreed because I knew nothing about thyroid problems or the scan for it.It was cancelled last week due to bad weather and road conditions. That has given me more time to do research on internet and talk to other people about their thyroid problems. The more I read I am starting to have second thoughts about having thy. scan done.

I don\\'t trust that statement.I am still in denial that I have a thyroid problem.I think maybe the lab made a mistake and I don\\'t want testing done that might create a problem where one doesn\\'t exsist.I think I would rather wait awhile and have TSH checked again.I am almost 64 and rather healthy other than on medication for high bloood pressure and for aterial fibrilation.

Did your doctor feel a nodule?  I\\'m hyper and have not had a thyroid scan so I don\\'t know the reasoning behind one.  If you are fearful, don\\'t be afraid to get a second opinion from an endocrinoligist.  They specialize in the thyroid gland and would know exactly what tests you need.\\nI was a nervous wreck before I had one done. I was just diagnosed with Graves disease and hyperthyroid last month, Feb 2001.\\n\\nSUPPOSEDLY the dose that is used for this test is smaller than the radiactivity exposure in an x-ray.\\n\\nThere are many tests that I think can and could be run before this to test for your thyroid condition: free T4 or T4 and T3 resin uptake and in Graves the key is thyroid autoantibodies including TSH receptor antibody (TSI or TRab) - not routine but may be helpful in selected cases such as hyperthyroidism.\\n\\nAs far as I understand the scan will tell the doc just HOW hyper or hypo you are to help determine proper dosage. And the scan is one of the better ways to see if you have nodules.\\n\\nI did my best to visualize myself safe, surrounded my God and angels and helpful people and being healthy and strong long after the scan.\\n\\nBest of health to you,\\n\\nPatricia\\nHi! Never be afraid of a test, there is danger crossing a street these days. The danger is in NOT knowing what is going on. Age has nothing to do with it. Get another opinion and then decide, but you probably will sleep better having the knowledge of what your options may or may not be. Too much info is correct--can be an overload. I am 50, and have suffered for yrs with thyroid, my mother is 75, takes a pill and is \"fine\" so there is no rhyme or reason. Do not let vanity, age, or well meaners stand in your way! Get informed, get that opinion and do what you have to ! Good luck!\\nGD\\nHi:\\nIm not sure if you had your scan or not, but its really one of the most benign medical tests. Painless and quick.The amount of radioactivity is miniscule. You probably get more when you use your microwave. The test as well as the treatment\\nof Radio Active Iodine\\nhave been around for almost 50 years. There have been numerous studies, and no proof of harmful effects from this. And 50 years is a long time! I must say that I have never heard of undergoing injections for this test. I have only had experience(and heard of) taking1-2 pills of radio-active isotope capules\\nthe day before the scan.\\nThe test is very helpful if there is a question of a thyroid nodule(s), as blood-work and physical exam, does not always provide the full story. I suffered with Graves disease (Hyperthyroidism) for 8 years. 2 of which I went undiagnosed. I tried the anti-thyroid medications. I had positive results off and on.\\nEventually the meds stopped working, and I felt terrible.\\nI resisted disolving my thyroid via RAI for years; out of fear, etc, and I must say I wish I didnt put if off for so long. I had RAI in September, 1999, and have been doing fairly well.\\nBlood work is certainly a good indicator for Hypo/Hyperthyroidism. Yet  in order to obtain a definitive diagnosis of suspicious\\nnodules, a thyroid uptake scan is a valuable diagnostic tool. I would suggest that you may want to see an endocrinologist(an MD who specializes in thyroid diseases) for a consultation and/or second opinion. In addition You should have more than a TSH blood test to determine a thyroid problem. There is a group of blood tests called a \"thyroid panel\" which includes in addition to TSH; T3 ,T4, etc.\\nFrom your elevated TSH and\\nelevated cholesterol level it sounds like hypothyroidism,\\nbut your symptoms, bloodwork, exam and accompanying tests will determine this. In any event, if it is your thyroid, just remember its treatable\\nBest of luck to you\\nJudith',\n",

As far as insomnia, she said \"yes\" it TSH affects sleep patterns, usually when it levels out to a good #, sleep pattern is better. I do not think that will happen in my case, as I am now Back on synthroid (ugh) and  my last TSh on that was a 3.  But for me, when I\\'m too low (which is good) I am so symptomic, at least she explained that while the lab number is good, the symptoms are not, and that some patients sensitivity is so great, that sometimes I might have to \"live with\" the higher tsh number to relieve all these other problems.  I tried tylenol PM\",s  takes about 4 to knock me down.  Have u tried the sleeping pill Ambien, it\\'s a Rx, and docs, will ration it out (don\\'t want u to be addicted..) well to them I say, if it makes me sleep at night and function in the day...what\\'s it to them\" ...but i see their point. Also, I am seeing a naturopathic doc this week, has anyone any suggestions on the combinations we should ALL be looking for with thyroid. (I am hypo...)   I have the added \"plus\" of being a diabetic.  So that\\'s another area........(that is under control). But wt. is up, cholesterol is up, and so its an on going battle all the time, HANG IN THERE.  To the Canadian friends, is it a good thing that Hillary Clinton failed in her social medicine agenda? I\\'m gathering you all have tremendous problems..........interesting comparisons....but our HMO\\'s are no bargain either.\\nAny suggestions on natural alternatives or supplments? B complex is good, also zinc...what how, much....has anyone gone into a health food store and tried to find exactly what you need.......it\\'s a supermarket and how do we know what\\'s good/bad/ugly/dangerous to us?  Any thoughts?\\nThanks and keep those doc\\'s on their toes.\\nLuckily mine is receptive and willing to play with dosages, even tho\\' I do not like the synthroid...what can I do.   She will not give me a T3 product with the palp\\'s I have.\\nI said the palps came also on the T4 levoxyl, so she\\'s lowering my dose and putting me back to synttrhoid brand..hate to admit did not have these problems so extreme on syn. Not great..but not as bad as the levoxyl brand..any one else have these problems.....!?',\n",

I got my TSH down from 14 to a 2, sounds very good..well...I am so symptomatic, anxious, moody, insomnia, etc.\\nMy endo. said that in some patients when the TSH dropped too low (even in normal lab value range) while the # was good, symptoms were NOT.  So she took me off levoxyl brand back onto synthroid (I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW). I did not have these symptoms as bad on the synt. She said she would not consider a T3 product because of the heart palps\\'s. I tried to explain to her that the palps happened with the armour (thinking it was the T3) but now the palps happened with a T4 product..(so...) but she said I\\'m too sensitive. She said that my last TSH on the .150 mcg of synt. was a 3, and she could live with that? Any thoughts out there on this? I am definitely interested in supplements, but how much too many, what?\\nIf I listened to every poster well meaning, one could be popping vitamins and supp\\'s all day long! But any comments are welcome.  Did anyone notice pain in legs on levoxyl, my legs were so bad, I had to take the heel of my one foot and grind it into my calves to help that. Endo. doc. also told me that to run a TRH is only indicated if the TSH is way out of whack?  Y/N? I see her 28th.  It is tiresome indeed!\\nHappy St. Patrick\\'s Day!\\nGD\\nYou may need the copper-zinc solution. I dislike pills too, but when we dson\\'t eat to get these nutrients, we have to supplement them! That is all there is to it. If you don\\'t get the nutrients you need, the med will not work properly. And if you take the med with foods that render the med useless, then it doesn\\'t work, either. We have to learn this for ourselves. A pill won\\'t fix our problems.\\n\\nHowever, you do need to find the TSH at which you personally are well.\\n\\nYou are not \"too\" sensitive! You feel what you feel. Get a second opinion or change endos to find one that listens! You may have only needed a tad bit less med.\\n\\nThe TRH is not for obviously out of whack thyroid. it is to detect imbalance that is not readily apparent.\\n\\nBut they already know yours needs corrected, so the test may not be needed.\\n\\nI would suggest you ask to try Levoxyl, as it is made in smaller does changes, so it is easier to fine tune the dose. Then stick with one med and try one does for six weeks, then report symptoms for possible dose adjustment. Switching meds doesn\\'t get you closer to finding your proper dose, it makes you begin all over again.\\n\\nI know this slow process is maddening! TF\\nHi TF:\\nWell I\\'m on the ole synthroid once again. I am sticking with this now for awhile. But the depression, jitter-i-ness, moodiness, is this all normal. I am a MESS!. My heard is pounding today, but then of course I was without med for 2 days, so my system is a yo yo right now. I feel sorry for my husband. He\\'d like to run and hide I\\'m sure. It\\'s like PMS, except more deep...seeing a therapist next week, if nothing else to yank me out of funk.  Nonetheless, patience is something that I must learn. I agree, stay on ONE thing and go from there.  Dr. was agreeable to lower my levoxyl, but said if I didn\\'t have these symptoms on synthroid, then go back to it.  She was willing in late \\'2000 to give the Armour a go..so I don\\'t fault her. She did listen and respond quickly this past weekend, esp. regarding the migraine..so I feel comfortable with her.  The previous endo. I went to...she would walk in, (you will all love this..) never look my way, sit and shuffle papers of lab reports, begin writing new Rx\\'s and then finally say, \"HOW ARE WE\" meantime answering the phone and going out of the room twice and 3 phone call interruptions.   So I did switch to this new younger gal, seems willing to listen..and try..I never had these problems till I played around with med\\'s so I guess I learned my lesson.  Any tips I should be looking for with nutritionist?\\nThanks TF, you\\'re a blessing!\\nGD\\nHi GD,\\nWell, I hope to at least be an encouragement!\\nI am glad you like this doc, that is so important.\\n\\nAbout nutrition, all I can say again, is read, read, read.\\nThe books recommended here have a lot of info about food supplements.

I found a topic of interest in the old Healthboards website about possible links between IBS and thyroid.\\nI have just found out that I have a swollen thyroid gland and the symptoms that are associated with that I have been having for a few years. These include anxiety and stress, irritability, always feeling like crying, rapid mood swings, my metabolism sped up quickly and I lost a lot of weight for no reason, occasional heart palpitations and some panic attack symptoms.\\nAlong with these symptoms I had occasional IBS symptoms in the following two year period - sudden bloating and gas after some food (but I could never work out a link) and some pain.\\nAfter another year of stress and a couple of life changes I began to have serious IBS symptoms - diarrhoea and constipation episodes, left hand side stomach pain, bloating and gas pain and \\'bubbling\\' noises down lower and psychological effects - I was too scared to go to the doctor and felt scared going back to places where I\\'d had bad episodes.\\n\\nThankfully my homeopath found I was allergic to wheat and dairy and some associated amines and for the past year have been undergoing treatment for these - allergy desensitisations and diets and I am much improved. There\\'s still the occasional bout but I feel better and know what to avoid usually (especially high fat processed foods with preservatives and pure wheat substances).\\n\\nWhat I have been wondering is what sparked me off. I\\'ve heard that intense stress over a long period of time could cause IBS and I certainly was unnaturally stressed because of my thyroid gland. Could this have been a big factor in my body rejecting wheat and dairy which I was previously OK with?\\n\\nNow I am having medicine (natural homeopathic) for this thyroid gland and am hoping that this\\'ll settle it down. I am very stressed still at the mo and are having some other IBS similar symptoms including frequent urination (on bad days only about half an hour after going before).\\n\\nThanks for all the topics of conversation here....really informative and helpful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n------------------\\nThanks, Charlie\\nHi Charlie,\\n\\nGrave\\'s disease is an autoimmune disorder of the thyroid.  It effects your nervous system, muscles, bones, legs, heart, hair, eyes, fingernails and intestines.\\n\\nI have Graves and prior to medication, the bathroom was one of my favorite spots  <IMG SRC=\"http://www.healthboards.com/ubb/wink.gif\">. I notice this part of the disease is not commonly discussed  <IMG SRC=\"http://www.healthboards.com/ubb/smile.gif\"> If you are having problems with any of the above, I would have your doctor run thyroid tests.  I personally feel these tests should be part of any physical.  It would sure prevent a lot heart ache.\\n\\nHopefully K9Mom will respond.  She is excellent at explaining things clearly.\\nHi Charlie,\\nAs Jleer said, Graves disease is an autoimmune disease where your body produces antibodies that attack the thyroid gland causing it to overproduce thyroid hormones resulting in hyperthyroidism (OVERactive thyroid gland).\\n\\nThere is no \"natural\" treatment for Graves disease.  It is a serious disease that left untreated can be fatal.  The 3 treatment options for Graves are 1) antithyroid medication, 2) radioactive iodine, 3) surgery.  There are pro\\'s and con\\'s to each of these treatments therefore it is wise for anyone with a Graves diagnosis to do their homework and decide with their doctor which treatment is right for them.\\n\\nI went to the Thyrodine website and from what I\\'ve read there, thyrodine is a concoction used to treat hypothyroidism (an UNDERactive thyroid gland).  Based solely on this information it is completely possible that if a hyperthyroid Graves patient took Thyrodine then they could quite possibly send themselves in to a thyroid storm which is a life threatening emergency.\\n\\nA diagnosis of Graves is made through blood tests, possibly an ultrasound of the thyroid gland and possibly a radioactive iodine uptake scan.\\n\\nI\\'m not clear on how Graves was brought up as a possibility for you, or how you got started taking Thyrodine, but please, if you are having the symptoms you describe, get yourself to a physician and get your blood tested.\\n\\nGood luck.\\n(sorry so long)\\n\\n------------------\\nSome days you\\'re the dog...some days you\\'re the hydrant!\\n(dx Graves 4/99, treatment w/Tapazole and Atenolol)<p>[This message has been edited by K9Mom (edited 03-08-2001).]\\nDear Charlie:\\n\\nI am in complete agreement\\nwith those who responded to your post. I suffered with Graves disease for 10 years.\\n2 out of the 10 yrs.I had no idea what was wrong with me.\\nEventually I had radio active Iodine to disolve my thyroid as the anti-thyroid meds no longer were effective.\\nIBS, panic attacks, heat intolerance are some of the symptoms. Graves can be exacerbated by stress or if in remission be reactivated by severe stress and/or trauma. It is an auto-immune disorder and tends to run in families(although\\nnoone in my immediate family has this problem) It can stem from way back in your family tree, and possibly went undiagnosed.\\nYou would need to have the appropriate blood work and\\nthyroid uptake scan to provide a more definitive diagnosis for Graves. It is not a guessing game, and by\\njust using homeopathic remedies without the benefits of laboratory studies seems counter-productive. Thyroid disease can be stubborn and\\na balancing act,  but is treatable with the appropriate medications. I would suggest you seek out a qualified board certified endocrinolgist\\nwho (if your location permits) is also associated with a major teaching hospital.\\nBest of luck to you!<p>[This message has been edited by Judith (edited 03-08-2001).]\\nIs this my friend, Judith, from the old boards?\\n\\nEither way, HI!

I read what a lot of the others with graves disease say and I have to agree.  You need to see an endocrinologist (specializes in thyroid disorders).\\n\\nGraves disease is being hyperthyroid.  My symptoms were rapid heart beat (120 per min.), hand tremors (that was the 1st sign for several years I had it), intolerance to heat, irritable bowel (diarhia sp?), swollen thyroid, brittle nails with uneven jagged nail beds, thinning hair, some weight loss and my husband says I was extremely grouchy and touchy.  You should have your T3/T4 blood levels checked and if they indicate they are out of range, they Dr. should want to do a radioactive uptake test.  Get to a specialist.  It was the best thing I have done for myself in a long time.  And think if anyone else in your family has thyroid problems, it tend to run in famiies.  I have it my brother has an enlarged thryroid with a nodule, my grandfather was hyperthyroid, and my son is Attention Deficit (which may be related).  Good luck!',\n",

I have my lab work and the nurse wrote under my TSH rate that I have HYPERthyroid. Also, my moms HYPO and was overweight for a long time (until they got her on the correct dosage). I\\'m the other way around. I lost 11pound in less than a year and I\\'m down to a weight I haven\\'t been at since four years ago (which is a long time since I\\'m only 16  <IMG SRC=\"http://www.healthboards.com/ubb/smile.gif\">).\\nI\\'m having my mom contact the doctors office to find out if I\\'m hypo/hyper. I already took today\\'s dose of synthroid, I hope that doesn\\'t hurt anything if I turn out to be hyper.\\nBy the way, this is what is says on the lab: TSH : 5.68 (my rate) - 0.15 / 4.20 (normal range). Would my TSH rate be high or low if I was hyper?? Mines high on this test.\\nI just got off the phone with a doctor (not my regular doctor) who said I do have hyperthyroidism, and my pituatary (sp?) gland is producing too much, so my T4 or T3 (can\\'t remember which one) rates are low and by taking synthroid it will raise my T3/T4 rates and prevent my pituatary gland from producing too much.\\nThen I talked to a different doctor who said that I shouldn\\'t be taking synthroid at all if I have hyperthyroidism. He told me not to take anymore of the medicine, while the other doctor told me to stay with the medicine.\\n\\nShould I take the medicine? I\\'m going back to the doctors Wednesday to get this all sorted out, but I\\'m weary about taking it now that I have two different opinions from two different doctors.\\nHi Ready:\\n\\nSomething is definitely not making sense here. If you are indeed HYPERthyroid, Synthroid  makes no sense.\\nSynthroid is a synthetic thyroid hormone indicated for those who are not producing enough thyroid hormone naturally.\\nWhen you are producing too much thyroid hormone your gland behaves is as if its in overdrive, hence overactive thyroid- which is HYPERthyroidism. This requires supression of the gland with drugs such as PTU or Tapazole.\\nIn other words, Synthroid stimulates a slow thyroid, and PTU or Tapazole slows it down.\\nSo if your hyperthyroid, synthroid would only stimulate the gland even more. As many people here can tell you normal ranges/levels of TSH vary with individuals, but to get an idea,\\na \"normal range\" for TSH is\\n0.23 to 5.40. It would help to know what your T3, T4 levels are. If you have a TSH level of 5.68, that\\'s a little elevated, which may indicate HYPOthyroid rather than HYPERthyroid. So in that case, Synthroid may be appropriate. I would set up an  appointment for youself, along with your mom, and meet with the physician, so you can review\\nthe results(in person), and have the Dr. explain your diagnosis and treatment plan in detail. If in doubt (which sounds as you are justified in this case) remember its your health and well being thats important. Do not accept this nurses  explanation by telephone. Make sure you have a clear understanding of what the problem is. You deserve alot of credit for questioning your meds, and just make sure you follow thru. Take care!\\nJudith\\nThanks for responding!!\\n\\nIf my mom gets off work early enough I\\'m going back to the doctors today to get this sorted out.\\n\\nJudith- I have a copy of my lab results, but it doesn\\'t list my T3 and T4 results, only TSH. I think the doctor first said I had \"low thyroid\" but I don\\'t know why she wrote on the lab results that I have hyperthyroid.\\nI\\'m losing weight, not gaining. I\\'m down to 108 which is very small for someone of my height.

I have not lost the weight, I\\'m exhausted, depressed for no reason, my skin is so dry, even with prescription medicine, my hair is dry, and I have been severely constipated, with a diet of many veges, fiber, fruit, taking metamucil, and drinking water, I still had to take large doses of laxatives, and do enemas.  This prompted a trip back to the doctor.  He said he would check my thyroid again.  I asked him this question, even if I fall within the \"normal range\" isn\\'t it true, that it may not be a \"normal value\" for me?  He said this is true.  Well today I got the results from the nurse, I\\'m in the normal range, argh.  My tsh was 1.7, my t4 was 6.8, and my t3 74.\\n\\nThis means my initial tsh was .435, then it was 1.4, now it\\'s 1.7\\n\\nMy initial t3 was 84, now 74\\n\\nMy initial t4 was 6.2 now 6.8\\n\\nDo thyroid levels fluctuate like this?\\n\\nI also want to comment that my body temp goes from 97 to 98, but usually is 97.6.\\n\\nI thought my doctor would still keep an eye, since we discussed how it may be normal for lab values, but not normal for me.\\n\\nMy father has hypothyroid, but they feel he had hyper, and it burned out\\nYes, Thyroid levels fluxuate during the day.  As to your constipation have you seen a GI specilist? If your father had an autoimune desease you could too.  You could be more prone to Diabetes, Crones, and such... If you have to use the laxitives for any lenghth of time you may cause a problem -so I would see a GI.  Also exersice can help with your symptoms.

And kept me on cardizem too.\\nDid your Dr do any other thyroid tests besudes a TSH?\\nWithout a full thyroid panel, its hard to judge. But if one was just to look at your TSH level- the normals are:\\n0.23 to 5.40, so your .46 is within normal range. If anything it is on the low side which would indicate Hyperthyroidism more than Hypothyroidism. I believe you said you have hypothyroid(??)\\nI would make sure you indeed have a thyroid problem to begin with, as something does not sound right. The typical blood tests for thyroid are:\\nTSH, Total T4, Free T4 and Total T3.\\nGood luck\\nJudith\\nHi judith, i am hypothyroid and am currently on 0.15 mgs of levoyxl my tsh has steadily dropped over the last 7 months. I have been on cardizem for a rapid heart rate[tachycardia]my dr. Called it. Since my tsh has gone down the cardizem can\\'t keep it down . Heartrate runs from 90 to as high as 104, that is why my dr. Wants to add atenolol. I took the atenolol with cardizem the other day and was so dizzy and light-headed i almost had a wreck. I do not have high blood pressure. Isee my dr. Wednesday as i can not take both drugs together.\\nIf your TSH is dropping from .46, the doctors need to look at that, your heading into hyper territory, which would explain the fast heart rate.  Are you going to an endocrinoligist?  They specialize in the thyroid drug balancing act.  I would not trust your thyroid health to a general practice doctor.  If your fast heart is a result of the thyroid, focusing on heart will not fix the problem.  The thyroid needs to be addressed first.<p>[This message has been edited by jleer (edited 03-13-2001).]\\nI agree..I am hypo...my TSH was 14, yes you read it correctly.

Then heart pounded, changed dosages, etc. Went from synthroid, to  Armour, pounding, to levoythroid, to levoxyl, now back to synthroid. No wonder I was bouncing.  This same endocrinologist had me on Cozaar for b/p. Had migraines, so she added atenolol.  My fam. pract. eyebrows went up on the 2 b/p\\'s medicines.  So needless to say in the hosp. my b/p went to 90/30, yes, 30. So all day/night they were b/p checking me and of course took me off the cozaar, which is what I had asked when she threw in the atenolol, \"is it too much b/p med?\" OH NO, said she.

I hope it helps\\n\\n\\nThyroiditis, an inflammation of the thyroid gland, produces transient hyperthyroidism often followed by transient hypothyroidism or no change in thyroid function at all.\\n\\nThe three types of thyroiditis are\\n\\n\\nHashimoto\\'s thyroiditis (autoimmune thyroiditis) is the most common type of thyroiditis and the most common cause of hypothyroidism. For unknown reasons, the body turns against itself in an autoimmune reaction, creating antibodies that attack the thyroid gland. (see page 816 in Chapter 168, Immunodeficiency Disorders) This type of thyroiditis is most common in elderly women and tends to run in families. The condition occurs eight times more often in women than in men and may occur in people with certain chromosomal abnormalities, including Turner\\'s, Down, and Klinefelter\\'s syndromes.\\n\\nHashimoto\\'s thyroiditis often begins with a painless enlargement of the thyroid gland or a feeling of fullness in the neck. When doctors feel the gland, they usually find it enlarged, with a rubbery texture, but not tender; sometimes it feels lumpy. The thyroid gland is underactive in about 20 percent of the people when Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis is discovered; the rest have normal thyroid function. Many people with Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis have other endocrine disorders such as diabetes, an underactive adrenal gland, or underactive parathyroid glands, and other autoimmune diseases such as pernicious anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren\\'s syndrome, or systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus).\\n\\nDoctors perform thyroid function tests on blood samples to determine whether the gland is functioning normally, but they base the diagnosis of Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis on the symptoms, a physical examination, and whether the person has antibodies that attack the gland (antithyroid antibodies), which can easily be measured in a blood test.\\n\\nNo specific treatment is available for Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis. Most people eventually develop hypothyroidism and must take thyroid hormone replacement therapy for the rest of their lives. Thyroid hormone may also be useful in decreasing the enlarged thyroid gland.\\n\\n\\nSubacute granulomatous (giant cell) thyroiditis, which is probably caused by a virus, begins much more suddenly than Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis. Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis often follows a viral illness and begins with what many people call a sore throat but actually proves to be neck pain localized to the thyroid. The thyroid gland becomes increasingly tender, and the person usually develops a low-grade fever (99° F. to 101° F.). The pain may shift from one side of the neck to the other, spread to the jaw and ears, and hurt more when the head is turned or when the person swallows. Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis is often mistaken at first for a dental problem or a throat or ear infection.\\n\\nInflammation usually causes the thyroid gland to release excessive thyroid hormones, resulting in hyperthyroidism, almost always followed by transient hypothyroidism. Many people with subacute granulomatous thyroiditis feel extremely tired.\\n\\nMost people recover completely from this type of thyroiditis. Generally the condition goes away by itself within a few months, but sometimes it comes back or, more rarely, damages enough of the thyroid gland to cause permanent hypothyroidism.\\n\\nAspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen) can relieve the pain and inflammation. In very severe cases, doctors may recommend corticosteroids such as prednisone, which should be tapered off over 6 to 8 weeks. When corticosteroids are stopped abruptly, symptoms often return in full force.\\n\\n\\nSilent lymphocytic thyroiditis occurs most often in women, typically just after childbirth, and causes the thyroid to become enlarged without becoming tender. For several weeks to several months, a person with silent lymphocytic thyroiditis has hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism before eventually recovering normal thyroid function. This condition requires no specific treatment, although the hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism may require treatment for a few weeks. Often, a beta-blocker such as propranolol is the only drug needed to control the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. During the period of hypothyroidism, a person may need to take thyroid hormone, usually for no more than a few months. Hypothyroidism becomes permanent in about 10 percent of the people with silent lymphocytic thyroiditis.\\n\\n\\nTake care\\nLori\\n\\n\\n\\n------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy homeopath gave the following recommendation for post-surgery trauma.  You can find homeopathic remedies in natural food stores, but I recommend retaining the advice of a known practitioner prior to use.\\n\\nTo take a homeopathic remedy, tap one sugar pill into the cap of the vial, but DO NOT TOUCH THE PILL. Tap the cap to release the pill under your tongue and let it dissolve completely. Do not eat or drink anything 10 minutes before a dose and 20 minutes after the pill dissolves. You increase the dosage by taking pills more frequently, NOT by taking more pills.  It is also recommended that you avoid mint and its relatives (camphor, menthol, tea tree oil) during homeopathic treatment.  Fennel toothpaste is useful for this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas recommended to aid the healing process. My homeopath says that Arnica is relatively benign, has no side effects, and cannot be overdosed.\\n\\nThe best case is to begin the Arnica\\nthe surgery:  Take one pellet three times a day, the day before the surgery.\\n\\nFor post-surgical trauma, I was told to take one pellet as soon as possible following surgery, followed by one pill every 15 minutes if pain is severe for up to 1 hour. Then take 1 pellet every 1-3 hours. The next day, taper off (as needed) but continue one pellet, three times a day for a week or more after the surgery.\\n\\nThis should help you with the pain, swelling, and any potential bruising.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas recommended.\\nTake one pellet as needed, up to every 15 minutes for the first hour.  Then taper off.  I found I needed three doses in the first hour, then two more doses (one in each of the next two hours) as the anesthesia left my body.\\n\\nToo much Phosphorus can make you constipated (as can the anesthesia), so use sparingly as needed.\\n\\n[This message has been edited by ArtfulD (edited 02-06-2002).]\\n\\n\\nIn the August 7th, Woman\\'s World magazine, found in virtually every grocery store where magazines are sold, on pages 14-16, they have some great exercises that really works the inner middle body muscles like a girdle.\\n\\nThey were developed by an exercise physiologist,Teresa Tapp. Get that magazine, if interested.

What is your approach to treating hypo?\\n\\nDesired answer:  treatment is based on a combination of symptoms and lab tests.  (What lab tests?  TSH, antibodies (once is usually enough), free or total T3 and free T4 are good places to start).\\n\\nb.  What medications do you use in treatment of hypo?\\n\\nDesired answer: whatever if takes.

If I don\\'t feel well when my labs are within the normal ranges, what do you do?\\n\\nDesired answers:  the normal ranges are just guidance, and there is often lots of room to play within the normal ranges.   If that doesn\\'t work, we have to consider things in addition to the thyroid for contributing to symptoms.\\n\\nWrong answer:  If normal ranges don\\'t make you feel well, it is all in your head.\\n\\nd.  What is your response to me asking about different approaches that I\\'ve read about on the internet or in books?\\n\\nDesired answer:  There is a lot of great info on the internet and books and some lousy info so one has to be selective.  Don\\'t hesitate to share the things you\\'ve learned about and we can discuss them in context to your treatment.  I always enjoy getting new articles from professional publications about evolving methods.\\n\\nWrong answer: stay away from the internet, there is only rubbish out there.\\n\\ne.  How long does it take for me to get well, or at least see some improvement?\\n\\nDesired answer:  It is a slow process because your body has a lot of healing to do plus it takes a well to optimize your meds for your body.  However, you should have made a lot of improvement in four to six months.\\n\\nWrong answer:  2 weeks or \"never\".\\n\\nf.  How often to you do tests and see me while we are in the optimization process?  (Right answer is about every six weeks to 2 months).\\n\\nWrong answer: once a year.\\n\\ng.  Once I\\'m stable, how often do you monitor.\\n\\nGood answer:  every 4 to six months for a couple of years.  If you are absolutely stable then once a year should be enough unless you are starting to show symptoms again, then you should call me.\\n\\nWrong  answer:  once a year no matter what.',\n",

I have tried sleep hygiene....medications (which make me groggy)......otc meds....Nothing works.  I am not depressed!!  I have a wonderful life except for the fact I cannot sleep or fall asleep.

Maybe it  would help you too.\\nThanks for the encouragement.  Surprisingly, I am not edgy but frustrated.  I just never really had any health problems to address.  I excercise regularly, eat well do the things we are suppose to do.  I am VERY BLESSED.  Beautiful, wonderful 8 month baby boy and a caring loving husband.  I feel like crap though. I get up every morning, work out, get dressed and go on with my day.  I thank God for the one or two hours HE gives me at night because it is sufficient to get through the day.  He wants me to learn something from all this.  I work part time as a pharmaceutical representative and am a registered nurse by trade.  So I know enough, more than the average person.  When you become the patient though, what is dealt is not the same.  The tables are turned.  My family doc called in some ambien no questions asked.  It is a quality of life issue.  There are medications to treat and a lot of doctors are very hesitant to give medications for fear of the \"drug seeker\"  which I am not.   Instead of me giving everyone advice...I am seeking it. As a professional RN/pharm rep I deal with doctors and nurses all the time. As a patient...I have a hard time trusting doctors because I have seen and heard what they say about patients.  When I was pregnant with my son, I trusted my OB.  When I delivered and started having all of these problems related to thyroid she blew me off.  She kept saying I had post partum depression.  My symptoms were raging headaches, heat intolerance and insomnia.  Dah??? no blood work ran just offered an antidepressant. When  I obtained my records from her, the last visit and her entry stated postpartum depression , double underlined, questioning bipolar disorder, reaction to new baby, anxiety and reffered to social worker/psych (which is a lie). There were additional assumptions that would make anyone think what an idiot.  I was humiliated.  Afraid to trust another doctor for fear they think I am a freak.  God wanted me out of her care.  I have a new doctor who is taking care of me.  I am starting to trust him.  I think he knows I am no dummy.  I am willing to work with him as he with me.  My endocrinologist I am not so fond of and I am getting up the courage to fire him and get another one.  Depending on the next visit and how it goes.  He would not let me try armour. He also does not give consistent answers.  He doesnt know how to say \"I dont know\"  Anyways, thanks for letting me vent.  Thanks for your words of encouragement.\\nSleepless in Jenison, MI\\nWhat were your levels last test TSH T4 and T3?  I am wondering how much our hormones are causing our problems?  Your vent was nice to hear.  I have some of the same concerns.  Here take this don\\'t ask just do! and the unwillingness to admit they don\\'t know. I know I am out of wack but what is causing it? And do we have to use a Pill or drug? Just sick of not being me.\\n\\nWell there is my vent for today.  I hope you find a professional that works with you and explains what\\'s going on or could be.\\nI hear you, too!!!\\nAmen to your total vent!\\n\\nI have read post-partum symptoms are from the great hormone change due to giving birth that the thyroid is working to rebalance, and sometimes simply cannot get rebalanced by itself.\\n\\nChild birth is when my thyroid went out of whack almost 19 years ago...do they support the thyroid...no....just call us names on our charts... I have a scarred leg, and found \"deformed\" written on my chart by one doctor.\\n\\nThank you for being open about what most of us deal with in the medical profession, though there are great professionals as well.\\nIt is very tough to deal with, esp. when unwell! And that is when we need them!\\nMy last TSH 2.85,  My free T4 1.0....I cannot remember my free T3.  Before I became pregnant, my TSH was always around 1.0 to 1.5.  Even though 2.85 is \"normal\" I do not think it is   normal for me.  I just restarted my 50mcg levoxyl a few days ago.  I just took it.  I always feel a difference within an hour and by about 3 pm I start to feel that \"bone\" tired.  But I cannot fall asleep.  I dont remember the last time I took a nap.  I have days I  can when my little baby goes down for a nap.  But my body does not sleep.  It has got to be my adrenal glands all screwed up.  I am pretty sure the adrenal glands play a part in sleep because of the cortisol they secrete at certain times of the day.',\n",

I felt like I was not even alive or in control. My brother took me home and I just collapsed in bed. I have had a few of these moments before and after and have been suffering from depersonalization 24/7 for about 6 years. Now I have had my share of anxiety attacks much like most of you but these attacks are much different, my brain just freezes up and I feel so unreal and not alive, like I am going to pass out. I suffer from the anxiety mainly over the DP and as of late the anxiety attacks have never produced these types of feelings, now they seem to be leaking over a little. Does anyone else experience anything like this? I dont have any breathing problems, they just hit out of the blue. I am having a hard time excepting this is not a medical condition. It all started after an ear infection but went away for a year or so after treatment. I still feel its related but the ENT did not think so. What about thyroid? I remember my Dr calling me twice after this first started (on 2 diff occasions about a year apart) and said there may be a problem with my thyroid, both times he called back and said he was wrong. I didnt think nothing of it at the time but it makes me wonder now, could it be thyroid or something else medical or do I actually have GAD? The Dr's have no idea.\\n\\nI also suffer from constant mental fog, poor memory, DP as noted above, slight hypoglycemia, floaters and other visual disturbances, poor conception of time, the list goes on.

I was on Synthroid until I moved to Germany at the age of 27 when I was switched to something called L-Thyroxine put out by Henning Pharmaceuticals.I currently take 125 mg a day. Anyway, for the past two years I've been feeling like cr*p even thought the doctors assure me that my levels are in the normal range. I still have a lot of hypo symptoms - hair falling out, weight gain (20 lbs in 2 yrs!), numb hands and feet, feeling cold when others are not, disturbed sleep. depression, anxiety attacks,zero sex drive etc. yet when I went over my last blood tests (from October 2000) with my doc, it turns out that the TSH was 0.3 (borderline hyper!) and the T4 was 7.5. The doc says this all looks perfectly normal to him but I asked him to schedule me for a physical to rule out anything else that could be causing my problems.\\n\\nMy question: on the day of a blood test, does it matter if you have taken your thyroid pill in the morning or not? I have always been advised not to take it and the last time I had the test done, I believe I took it by mistake. Could this have changed the results? I certainly don't feel like someone with a TSH of .3!\\n\\nAlso, two years ago I started using a hormonal IUD called the Mirena (just became available in the US in Feb. 2001) which gives off small amounts of synthetic progesterone (levonorgestrel) over a period of 5 years. This also seems to be causing side effects that are similar to hypo: weight gain, skin changes, mood changes, etc although my ob/gyn has assured me that these problems could not possibly come from the IUD. Does anyone have experience with thyroid and female hormones?\\n\\nI'm really confused as to what exactly is making me feel so bad and would like to know if anyone has any ideas on this. Thanks so much!\\n\\ntiny\\nI read that other hormones should not be taken at the same time as thyroid hormones.\\nI am not sure if that includes an IUD.\\n\\nHormones DO cause imbalances when taken artifically. It can upset the thyroid balance...in your case you may be going hyperthyroid, which may account for your symptoms.\\nHave you researched the side-effects of the IUD drug?\\n\\nAre you being seen by an endo?\\nTF\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi...\\nOn an older message board... I saw some posts about a possible link between Paxil and thyroid problems. And... as with thyroid problems sometimes there is a high cholesterol problem. This message - accepted no more posts... but.. this message talked about which came first... the cholesterol problem or... the introduction of Paxil to the system. In my case - I think possibly my cholesterol was already high... not sure though... and I wonder if the Paxil is making things worse... My thyroid is off as well... but not typical... my doctor called it Euthyroid Sick Syndrome - which... from my understanding ... your thyroid - TSH - is somewhere in the \"normal\" range - mine being low normal... but your T4 is low. He said this may be causing the cholesterol problem as well.. and wanted me to take Zocor. But... I am wondering if the Paxil might be the culprit... maybe not causing but... making my cholesterol worse - from the thyroid problem. I read that a rare side effect of Paxil is... hyper or hypothyroidism or thyroiditis. I am trying to get off of Paxil... have only been taking 10mgs for quite some time... and thought going off of that low of a dose wouldn\\'t be that difficult... however... it\\'s pretty rough... finally talked to the nurse at my dr\\'s office who instructed me how to ween myself off of it... I can\\'t help but think something such as Paxil... if the withdrawl is that severe... has! to be causing something bad in the system... and also hope that it isn\\'t permanent. I also read on the message board - someone who thought they had read of a connection with viruses and Paxil... that is a large part of what I am feeling - run down - feverish - and for the last few months thought i was entering early menopause - I am 40 - my hormone levels were slightly high... indicating the possiblity of the onset of menopause. But... the hotflashes or what I thought were... are getting soooo much worse now with the Paxil withdrawl... I\\'m wondering if it can affect my body in a way to cause the hormone levels to elevate... that may be a stretch...\\nBut... If anyone has had any problems that may link their thyroid problems and Paxil, I\\'d be very intrested to know... My doctor has ruled it out... not even a possibility. Even thought I should stay on the Paxil. After these withdrawls... I\\'m not comfortable with being on this stuff...\\nThanks!!\\nHello:\\nI too was put on Paxil, lasted one day. THen switched to zoloft. BOTH of them have caused me to shake, sweat, yesterday FAINT, incoherent, did not know my husband. Ambulance, YOU NAME IT.  THe side effects are killing me and the depresssion isn\\'t as bad as this. They halved my dose starting today and I\\'m so sick and tired of this and only been on this since March 26, I see family doc. today or tomorrow and we have to \"see\" what we will do.  The E/R doc said classic signs of zoloft reaction (paxil, celexa, effexor, all the same class SSRI\\'s). Well it may help some and I do have to admit I was not as depressed, however, I had had multiple thyroid dose/med changes since Nov. and I SWEAR even if the docs say NO, that this \"enhanced\" the depression and migraines. Now my TSH is zero. GO FIGURE. I am very anxious over this zoloft garbage and will wean down, it\\'ll probably take me weeks. I am on low dose of xanax (tranq) to keep me level. I just wish you luck. How did they tell you to wean down?\\nKeep me posted, please. Sorry for suffering.\\nGD\\nHi Zinga,\\n\\nEverything you say is possible...we need to understand that the job of the thyroid is to balance out body hormone chemicals and chemicals we put into or that get into the body. Thyroids can fail to do the job for various reasons and one reason can be that we are ingesting too many extreme chemicals, deemed \"safe\" for us to take...what? they won\\'t kill us???\\n\\nSometimes we NEED the drug effects in drastic cases, so I am not knocking drugs at all...just the way they get used as a so-called cure for everything, with no regard for the very real side-effects...we need to know what we are thinking of taking.\\n\\nOften drugs are worse than the original condition and can prevent us from getting treatment for the true basis for our illness.\\nOK, enough of my rant on that subject!\\nI just am irritated when people suffer needlessly!\\n\\nSo-called Euthyroid Sick Syndrome often is not treated by doctors, when some thyroid supplement might save us a lot of suffering, as it has for me...please read my story below.\\n\\nYes, yes, yes, paxil can increase your need for thyroid and give you hypothyroid symptoms on top of whatever chemical/hormonal crash you may be experiencing. The only solution is to go off it and wait long enough for it to all be gone out of the system...I have no idea how long that would be...possibly a compounding pharmacist would know. they know a great deal about drugs, as opposed to the regular drug store patented product sales people.\\n\\nI went off my hormone supplement and all pills for a month before I began my thyroid so I could get that leveled out before seeing if I actually do need anyhting else.\\nNow I am much less female hormone and take a few daily supplemnts is all, and I am fine.\\n\\nI do have aches, depression, etc., but it is the normal passing feelings, not consuming my life as before. I always can tell they are from other reasons, because basically I feel OK.\\n\\nYou can get thru this! I did, so can you.

FOR GOOD. My doc. \"thinks\" the zoloft should \"not\" do this, but I never shook before (he thinks its the anxiety-baloney) and am on low dose zanax to get thru the panicky feelings. I have never felt so sick in my life,I feel free, and it\\'s only a day. I don\\'t care if it gives me withdrawls, I am just happy to be off that crap ZOLOFT. I had a good day Thurs. and BAM Fri. was horrible, so who needs this. What is this doing to the restof my body, I have to think of not only thryoid, but am also a diabetic (and guess what, since on Zoloft, my numbers are UP UP UP) so...don\\'t let docs says stuff \"shouldn\\'t\" do stuff to our auto immune systems, IT DOES AND I\"M LIVING (ALMOST HALF DEAD FROM SHAKING) proof. HAng in there. I\\'m still going to counseling and this woman also is the only person besides me who says (as well as one E/R doc) that the balancing out of my thryoid helped.............so there ya have it!\\nGood luck!\\nTxs for info. Paxil knocked me out first night. Shoulda told them second SSRI would do it, eh? Duh. to these docs.\\nGD... are you feeling better these days?\\nHi Zinga:\\nThank you for asking. I am slowly coming along. I was back into the hosp. for 3 days last week for suspected pulmonary/heart problems, diff. in breathing, chest pain, and guess what ?  The genius endocrinologist who did allmy original dose changes had put me 2 b/p meds, tanked, then remaining one was thought to be \"OK\", they had to push my pulse UP to get the blood pressure, well DUH,the beta blocker atenolol for b/p was knocking me way down, so cardiologist said NO B/P med. I am a walking case of what went wrong, why, who, what and where. In the last month, I have seen 2 psychiatrists (spent 10 mins. with each and SEE YA LATER--they liked the Zoloft), one cardiologist, 2 Family practioners, 1 pulmonary guy. They found out I have asthma (knew all this b4), with coalesced lung tissue (gross but caused by asthma), low O2 in my blood (no ansswers for that one), but hey, thru my yelling about thryoid, all my numbers are \"normal\" range. I am seeing the family pract. who told me he won\\'t \"touch\" my syntrhoid, so can I have a discussion about T3 with this guy?I THINK NOT.  THey have me on a low low dose of xanax, a tranq. which I\\'m not happy to take, but need it to keep me evened out all day. It\\'s so low, I don\\'t really mind. I am OFF the Zoloft, I can not speak for anyone else, but it killed me. My b/p was low enuf, I was seeing electrical zaps in my eyes, and hearing it in my head, I don\\'t care how depressed I got, the shaking I experienced from multiple dose changes in/out of the hospital and too many docs with the fingers in the pie also caused me BIG TIME problems. The ambulance driver told me, you are in an overdose, this when the 10 minute wonder psych. said jump in only 6 days from 25-50-62.5. So what can one expect from a body? Not much........NO MORE WILL I EVER EVER EVER TAKE ANY OF THE SSRI drugs, or even Effexor, which has one compound of the SSRI in it, and Serzone, can flare up migraines. The 10 min. wonder shrink said try Elavil, it\\'s an \"older\" class of drugs, my question is \"what is this going to do\".  When ALL I really want is for anxiety to GO AWAY, and et more energy.\\nBut I am getting out, I am starting Yoga in fact tomorrow and try to plan something for each day to get out. I am also a diabetic, so the docs. are watching that too, and for some strange miracle, that\\'s been stable (I should not mention it....jinx myself).\\nSo be careful of drugs is my motto, be careful of supplements. I did mention a supplement which I ordered to cardiologist as it contains gingko, he thought it ok.  Ask a diff. doc. and he\\'ll say NO.  So I take it day at a time. What a rough 5-6 weeks it\\'s been. Tree Frog knows what\\'s been like too.\\nThank you for asking.  I am on synthroid .150.\\nI appreciate the support. Boy if we could do a March on Washington stick our throats out there and complain in unison maybe docs/drug companies would listen.  THEY KNOW THEY GOT US RIGHT WHERE THEY WANT US-$$\\nGD\\nGeeeeze I know... It is absolutely ridiculous. Patients are not being heard. Drs. are on such a power trip... think they know all and don\\'t take into consideration all the unknown factors... it\\'s so frustrating! I\\'m plowing thru my counselor telling me i should stay on Paxil and my Fam. Prac. telling me the same... I say there must be a better way!! I\\'m starting to feel normal again ... my \"normal\" at least.\\nfeel physically so much better now that i\\'m all but off the Paxil. But you are right I don\\'t know what! it is going to take. My Mom passed away a year ago of liver disease...\\nnever drank... the drs told us ... after she died... she had Hep C... when she died though... they didn\\'t have a clue!! why she died. That just blows my mind!!! she was 68. It\\'s a major organ!!!  Was put in the hospital with severe back problems and was in intense pain from osteoperosis???? which they newly diagnosed. Now my brother and I are wondering if it wasn\\'t actually Lupus... we\\'ll never know...\\nYou\\'re right. These doctors don\\'t have a clue and can\\'t they see from something like this they need to open their minds!!!!! to that gray area of medicine.... Now... I don\\'t trust doctors for one minute. And the drs. don\\'t seem to understand why! i won\\'t follow their instruction... hmmm... don\\'t respect them nor can i find one i do respect...\\nIt is thru these boards you feel more confident in your intuitions. Sad really sad. they are making huge bucks... and won\\'t listen to the people initiating the big bucks... the patient.\\n\\nTree Frog... how are you doing? I hope your feeling well!!  <IMG SRC=\"http://www.healthboards.com/ubb/smile.gif\">\\n\\nThanks!!  <p>[This message has been edited by Zinga (edited 05-05-2001).]\\nI found other sites which address the virus/like issue in relation to Paxil...

You might possibly be hypothyroid, even though you have a \"normal\" reading. The way the article sounded that I read, some doctors are now consider anything above 2 as not normal. Another Doctor feels anything over 1.5 could raise a red flag, assuming obviusly that you\\'ve got some symptoms that may correlate with hypo thyroidism. Good luck. There is no clear cut answer it seems.\\nI went to the Doc in the first place because I have been exercising (running 3X per week and the other 2 days regular exercise) and I didn\\'t notice any change in my weight.  I wasn\\'t looking at #\\'s but was looking for the fit of my clothes.  I also asked for hormone tests to see if they were out of wack.  I felt she totally dismissed my concerns and said that if I don\\'t lose any weight in 6 months to sit back and except my weight.  I wasn\\'t a happy camper when I left the office.  A couple years ago I did the same with the running/exercises and lost 20+ pounds in about 3 months.

I hope it helps\\n\\n\\nThyroiditis, an inflammation of the thyroid gland, produces transient hyperthyroidism often followed by transient hypothyroidism or no change in thyroid function at all.\\n\\nThe three types of thyroiditis are\\n\\n\\nHashimoto\\'s thyroiditis (autoimmune thyroiditis) is the most common type of thyroiditis and the most common cause of hypothyroidism. For unknown reasons, the body turns against itself in an autoimmune reaction, creating antibodies that attack the thyroid gland. (see page 816 in Chapter 168, Immunodeficiency Disorders) This type of thyroiditis is most common in elderly women and tends to run in families. The condition occurs eight times more often in women than in men and may occur in people with certain chromosomal abnormalities, including Turner\\'s, Down, and Klinefelter\\'s syndromes.\\n\\nHashimoto\\'s thyroiditis often begins with a painless enlargement of the thyroid gland or a feeling of fullness in the neck. When doctors feel the gland, they usually find it enlarged, with a rubbery texture, but not tender; sometimes it feels lumpy. The thyroid gland is underactive in about 20 percent of the people when Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis is discovered; the rest have normal thyroid function. Many people with Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis have other endocrine disorders such as diabetes, an underactive adrenal gland, or underactive parathyroid glands, and other autoimmune diseases such as pernicious anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren\\'s syndrome, or systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus).\\n\\nDoctors perform thyroid function tests on blood samples to determine whether the gland is functioning normally, but they base the diagnosis of Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis on the symptoms, a physical examination, and whether the person has antibodies that attack the gland (antithyroid antibodies), which can easily be measured in a blood test.\\n\\nNo specific treatment is available for Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis. Most people eventually develop hypothyroidism and must take thyroid hormone replacement therapy for the rest of their lives. Thyroid hormone may also be useful in decreasing the enlarged thyroid gland.\\n\\n\\nSubacute granulomatous (giant cell) thyroiditis, which is probably caused by a virus, begins much more suddenly than Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis. Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis often follows a viral illness and begins with what many people call a sore throat but actually proves to be neck pain localized to the thyroid. The thyroid gland becomes increasingly tender, and the person usually develops a low-grade fever (99° F. to 101° F.). The pain may shift from one side of the neck to the other, spread to the jaw and ears, and hurt more when the head is turned or when the person swallows. Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis is often mistaken at first for a dental problem or a throat or ear infection.\\n\\nInflammation usually causes the thyroid gland to release excessive thyroid hormones, resulting in hyperthyroidism, almost always followed by transient hypothyroidism. Many people with subacute granulomatous thyroiditis feel extremely tired.\\n\\nMost people recover completely from this type of thyroiditis. Generally the condition goes away by itself within a few months, but sometimes it comes back or, more rarely, damages enough of the thyroid gland to cause permanent hypothyroidism.\\n\\nAspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen) can relieve the pain and inflammation. In very severe cases, doctors may recommend corticosteroids such as prednisone, which should be tapered off over 6 to 8 weeks. When corticosteroids are stopped abruptly, symptoms often return in full force.\\n\\n\\nSilent lymphocytic thyroiditis occurs most often in women, typically just after childbirth, and causes the thyroid to become enlarged without becoming tender. For several weeks to several months, a person with silent lymphocytic thyroiditis has hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism before eventually recovering normal thyroid function. This condition requires no specific treatment, although the hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism may require treatment for a few weeks. Often, a beta-blocker such as propranolol is the only drug needed to control the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. During the period of hypothyroidism, a person may need to take thyroid hormone, usually for no more than a few months. Hypothyroidism becomes permanent in about 10 percent of the people with silent lymphocytic thyroiditis.\\n\\n\\nTake care\\nLori\\n\\n\\n\\n------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy homeopath gave the following recommendation for post-surgery trauma.  You can find homeopathic remedies in natural food stores, but I recommend retaining the advice of a known practitioner prior to use.\\n\\nTo take a homeopathic remedy, tap one sugar pill into the cap of the vial, but DO NOT TOUCH THE PILL. Tap the cap to release the pill under your tongue and let it dissolve completely. Do not eat or drink anything 10 minutes before a dose and 20 minutes after the pill dissolves. You increase the dosage by taking pills more frequently, NOT by taking more pills.  It is also recommended that you avoid mint and its relatives (camphor, menthol, tea tree oil) during homeopathic treatment.  Fennel toothpaste is useful for this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas recommended to aid the healing process. My homeopath says that Arnica is relatively benign, has no side effects, and cannot be overdosed.\\n\\nThe best case is to begin the Arnica\\nthe surgery:  Take one pellet three times a day, the day before the surgery.\\n\\nFor post-surgical trauma, I was told to take one pellet as soon as possible following surgery, followed by one pill every 15 minutes if pain is severe for up to 1 hour. Then take 1 pellet every 1-3 hours. The next day, taper off (as needed) but continue one pellet, three times a day for a week or more after the surgery.\\n\\nThis should help you with the pain, swelling, and any potential bruising.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas recommended.\\nTake one pellet as needed, up to every 15 minutes for the first hour.  Then taper off.  I found I needed three doses in the first hour, then two more doses (one in each of the next two hours) as the anesthesia left my body.\\n\\nToo much Phosphorus can make you constipated (as can the anesthesia), so use sparingly as needed.\\n\\n[This message has been edited by ArtfulD (edited 02-06-2002).]\\n\\n\\nIn the August 7th, Woman\\'s World magazine, found in virtually every grocery store where magazines are sold, on pages 14-16, they have some great exercises that really works the inner middle body muscles like a girdle.\\n\\nThey were developed by an exercise physiologist,Teresa Tapp. Get that magazine, if interested.

Here\\'s what I came up with, but I am sure tyhere are othere things that can and will be added over time.\\n\\nAvoid unless cooked thouroughly:\\n\\n* African cassava\\n* Asparagus\\n* babassu (a palm-tree coconut fruit popular in Brazil and Africa)\\n* Broccoli\\n* brussels sprouts\\n* Cabbage\\n* Cauliflower\\n* horseradish\\n* kale\\n* kohlrabi\\n* leafy green vegetables (turnip greens, mustard greens, collard greens)\\n* Legumes (beans and peas)\\n* peanuts\\n* pine nuts\\n* Processed meats\\n* radishes\\n* rutabaga\\n* Spinach\\n* turnips\\n* Watercress\\n\\nAvoid entirely:\\n\\n* Soy in any form that isn\\'t fermented\\n* millet (actually WORSE when cooked)\\n* Rapeseed, canola, flax, soybean, safflower, corn and other polyunsaturated fats/oils\\n\\nQuestions to ask a potential doctor:\\n\\nA friend posted this fantastic list of questions that she composed to another message board.  I asked her if I could post it here, and this is her gracious response: \"You can use it as much as you want.  Power to the patient! ... \\'Nette\"\\n\\nHere\\'s the list:\\n\\na. What is your approach to treating hypo?\\n\\nDesired answer:  treatment is based on a combination of symptoms and lab tests.  (What lab tests?  TSH, antibodies (once is usually enough), free or total T3 and free T4 are good places to start).\\n\\nb.  What medications do you use in treatment of hypo?\\n\\nDesired answer: whatever if takes.  Some of those available are Synthroid, Thyrolar, Cytomel and natural meds like Armour.\\n\\nWrong answer:  Synthroid only.\\n\\nc.  If I don\\'t feel well when my labs are within the normal ranges, what do you do?\\n\\nDesired answers:  the normal ranges are just guidance, and there is often lots of room to play within the normal ranges.   If that doesn\\'t work, we have to consider things in addition to the thyroid for contributing to symptoms.\\n\\nWrong answer:  If normal ranges don\\'t make you feel well, it is all in your head.\\n\\nd.  What is your response to me asking about different approaches that I\\'ve read about on the internet or in books?\\n\\nDesired answer:  There is a lot of great info on the internet and books and some lousy info so one has to be selective.  Don\\'t hesitate to share the things you\\'ve learned about and we can discuss them in context to your treatment.  I always enjoy getting new articles from professional publications about evolving methods.\\n\\nWrong answer: stay away from the internet, there is only rubbish out there.\\n\\ne.  How long does it take for me to get well, or at least see some improvement?\\n\\nDesired answer:  It is a slow process because your body has a lot of healing to do plus it takes a well to optimize your meds for your body.  However, you should have made a lot of improvement in four to six months.\\n\\nWrong answer:  2 weeks or \"never\".\\n\\nf.  How often to you do tests and see me while we are in the optimization process?  (Right answer is about every six weeks to 2 months).\\n\\nWrong answer: once a year.\\n\\ng.  Once I\\'m stable, how often do you monitor.\\n\\nGood answer:  every 4 to six months for a couple of years.  If you are absolutely stable then once a year should be enough unless you are starting to show symptoms again, then you should call me.\\n\\nWrong  answer:  once a year no matter what.',\n",

I know it\\'s tuff but hang in there.  What you could do is ask your doctor if you can go on a trial dose of medicine to see if it helps you.  Also ask the doctor \"if it can\\'t hurt me, than just start me off on a low dose\".  Make sure if thyroid problems run in your family that you tell them.

I have been sick also with hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism in the last 9 yrs, so I know what you are going through.  There are 2 types of autoimmune diseases of thyroid: Hashimoto\\'s disease-which is hypothyroidism and Grave\\'s disease -which is hyperthyroidism.  You need to get an antibodies test in order to tell if you have either of them.  It is a blood test.  I would strongly recommend that you read alot of books on the subject of thyroid especially \"The Thyroid Solution\" by Ridha Arem, and \"Solved the riddle of illness\" by Stephen E. Langer, both are M.D.\\'s who happen to know what they are talking about.  I know it is so frustrating, but hang in there, and while you are searching for a good Dr., educate yourself as much as possible on the thyroid subject.  Hope you find a good Dr. real soon, keep us updated.  bye for now, Virginia.\\nThanks so much for your kind and caring responses! Yesterday my heartbeat shot thru the roof, then it went down this morning. I felt so wired. Now this afternoon it shot back up again...they did take an antibody test finally yesterday when i begged them to..they kept telling me its anxiety...geez, my thyroid tests proved otherwise...the endo docs told me my thyroid was not enlarged months ago....I did ask them for a very low dose of something, but even this they refused...there are no other endo docs to see...really! I need to slow my heartbeat down, can you please tell me any alternatives to help this? thanks\\nHi Potato, I think if you can\\'t find an Endo who will help you, you should try a general practitioner or any Dr. who will help you.  If you have to, go to the emergency room at the hospital.  I am so sick of this happening to people with thyroid disease, being ignored just makes things worse.  These people should be sued.  I hope you get help soon.  Please keep me posted.   Virginia.\\nHello,\\nI totally agree with Virginia!  Go to the emergency room!  Someone has to help you.  Like I said before unfortunately, you have run into some idiot doctors.  I think they become so used to seeing patient after patient they become cold to their job.  Not all doctors but alot do!!\\nAs far as slowing down your heartbeat, I really don\\'t know!  So sorry, just don\\'t know that question.  I really feel bad for you, because I know what your going through.  It is twice as hard when doctors ignore the problems making us feel crazy.\\nI hope you can get some help.\\nKeep us posted!  Don\\'t give up!\\nEMILY\\nI had to go to the emergency room with a pulse of 155!  The family doctor said I had anxiety about a week before that.  My thyroid is only slightly enlarged and the family doctor did not even notice.  Thank god the endo I have now is good!  The emergency room gave me something to calm my heart down and called the endo I\\'m seeing now. Who, by the way said I was the most hyperthyroid she had ever seen.  Don\\'t sit at home in a panic, it will only make things worse.  Maybe the emergency room doctor can be more resourceful than you in helping find a doctor.  I really think it\\'s terrible that we have to go to that level to get the proper help but hell, do whatever it takes!  Good luck to you.\\nOh DEAR!!! I went to the ER and the docs there did the normal ER tests and said my blood pressure was fine, even though it was high 150....they just gave me an IV and sent me home 4 hours later...the tests they ran in ER said my red blood count was low and so was my potassium....but they never called my endo doc because they said  IT WAS JUST A VIRUS MAKING MY HEART BEAT FAST LIKE THAT!!!They said it wasnt my thyroid...so i went yesterday to the internal med doc and i begged her to take an antibody test...she finally said ok, but told me to go see a psychiatrist...geez...\\nHey potato,\\nIt is easy for them to tell us we need shrinks!  What a bunch of idiot doctors!  Try and eat some bananas for potasium, and your gonna have to find a decent doctor.  If it makes you feel any better I am so fatigued all day long my eyes feel sore and hard to keep open.  My doctor seems to be trying to help me, but I am not getting any relief from my medicine.  I have to go see a specialist, but their all booked for months.\\nI had an anxiety attack so bad a while back that I went to the hospital thinking I was having a heart attack.  My heart was beating so fast I thought I was going to die.  They sent me home and said I was fine.  Well, I sure did not feel fine.  That is why people with meatobilism problems need to see an endo!  I know you have but you just got bad luck with the few doctors you have seen.  Their are good doctors, but hard to find!\\nAtleast by talking to each other we can relate, and know were not the crazy ones!  Good luck to you, I sure understand your pain.  Somedays, I just wan\\'t to give up, because I feel like I will never feel good again, but I will just have to find a doctor that knows what their doing!\\nGood Luck To You!\\nTake Care and keep us updated\\nEMILY\\nP.S.Be careful of taking anything with stimulants because that will make your heart-rate go more fast.(caffiene too)  Geesh, I can\\'t even have a cup of coffee without wigging out!!\\nPotato,\\nI forgot to mention I really don\\'t know of any alternative things for your rapid heartrate!  So, sorry!\\nTree Frog is a good person to talk to she comes to this board alot, but she is gone for a week right now.  When she gets back maybe she can be of some help.  She has been very helpful to me!\\nTry to keep calm because stress will trigger your symptoms to feel worse!  Hang in their!  Good things come to those who wait!!\\nEMILY\\nHaving had pretty severe Graves Disease, the only way to slow the heart rate down that I know of, is to remove the hormone that your thyroid is producing in overabudance.  The only way to do that is with medication or surgery.  I can\\'t believe they didn\\'t give you PTU or something of that sort.  Even if it is mild hyperthyroidism, it needs to be treated.  It can only get worse.  Thyroid conditions are very serious.  Now, if we could just convince the dr.\\'s of that without having ot have a heart attack or heart failure first!\\n\\nOne thing that will help is to cut out caffeine.  With your potassium being low, if you are drinking caffeine, it\\'s acting as a diuretic.  That will drain your potassium level.  When I was hyperthyroid, 1/2 of a diet coke made me feel like my heart was coming out of my chest.  The Dr. put me on Inderal, which I think is a pretty common thing to do, along with drinking iodine (which I don\\'t recommend-it\\'s horrible).  He also put me on PTU (can\\'t remember what it stands for but don\\'t take it on an empty stomach it will make you sick).  I can\\'t believe your dr. wouldn\\'t just try you on it! Being hyperthyroid, he should have sent you for a thyroid uptake and do more testing.  Unfortunately, you are going to have to start kicking butt and taking names until you find the right dr.  I\\'ve been through many.  I think we all have on this board. Good Luck and let us know how it goes.\\nWell on monday i will go to the same endos from last year...i cannot afford the others off my insurance plan..and these gave me tapazole last year which made me deathly sick and it screwed with my liver badly...i am going to seek alternative methods. I heard lemonbalm and bugleweed are good....but what are the symptoms of toxic thyroid? No one has told me yet...\\nI did not know Tapazole screwed up the liver.  More information on that please, if you have it.  That\\'s bad!  I, at one time, was taking 60mgs a day of it!  I\\'m down to 15mgs a day now and it has never made me sick.  Atenolol calmed my heart right down and my ankle swelling went away almost as soon as I started taking it.  Sounds like you have to be really careful.  As far as I know there are only two anti-thyroid drugs, PTU and Tapazole.\\n\\nBy the way, if you go to a psychiatrist, they will propably run a thyroid test before they start treating you!  Thyroid problems are their number one misdioagnosis!\\n\\nWhen you go to the doctor, let us know what your numbers are and insist on a T3 and T4 count.\\n\\nGood luck!\\nIf you are indeed hyperthyroid, then yes, all one can do is take a medication or have surgery to remove part or all of it.\\nBUT,\\nsince the cabbage family lowers thyroid production, try eating lots of it.\\n\\nDefinitely keep stress down, quit caffiene and all stimulants!\\nupdate! I contacted a virus 2 wks ago, that attacked my thyroid, causing the thyroid to go hypo..i now feel lethargic, drenched sweating, heart beat goes up still, feverish feeling, dizzy, and urinating alot since this virus. I believe my cholesterol levels are also going up, since my thyroid is swollen...i still havent gotten my thyroid tests back, and i am tired of them dismissing my calls..i\\'m going in person on monday morning..This virus was a deadly virus, causing my thyroid to swell and now i feel like its choking me. My neck feels swollen..this is awful, first i was hyper then now hypo..all i want is the doctors to treat me correctly...its so hard and frustrating for me..i\\'m am so close to going alternative to the health store, seems like the docs wont help me..are there any alternatives at the health store, anyone know??',\n",

It was very hard on my husband.\\n\\nMany people lose that desire. I have been on a good dose for me over a year and still don\\'t really care about it. But I make an effort now and before could not even respond! That is me, and he will just be himself, so I can\\'t tell about him.\\n\\nHe probably feels very inadequate, also, which will hold him back more, too.\\nLove him for himself and allow him space to recover...he has been on meds a very short time. I took a year to find my appropriate med level and to recover. We are all different. think of what he needs and encourage him where he is...I know it is hard...love always is, because it requires thinking past our own selves and desires.\\n\\nHe is not doing this on purpose and likely is pretty depressed about it.\\n\\nIt should pass but I can\\'t say when! TF\\nThank you, Tree Frog, for responding to my quest for support for my husband. It\\'s the advice that I\\'ve been getting - \"just wait\", \"hang on\", etc.\\n\\nIt\\'s like someone took away my husband and gave me an impolite, non-conversive stranger with his face. A man who was always interested in intimacy suddenly closes his eyes at bedtime so he won\\'t see me. He won\\'t be social and wants to die. I know it\\'s only been 3 months of this behavior-condition, but I\\'m starting to lose hope that I\\'ll ever find in him the man I married. He was my best friend up until February. Now, he won\\'t even call me by my name.\\n\\nMy counselor doesn\\'t seem to understand the nuances of the hypothyroid-specific depression, so while he lets me talk, we can\\'t fine-tune my understanding of the situation.\\n\\nAny extra words of wisdom that can help me hang on? I don\\'t want us to be a thyroid-ruined marriage statistic!\\nYou can always come here for venting and understanding...and tell your husband about us, we understand what he is going through.\\nThis problem is a low blow, indeed!\\n\\nFeed him B 100 complex daily, and get the book, The Thyroid Solution for both of you to read. It is imperative to know what you are dealing with and what you can do for yourselves.  That book is excellent and has a lot of self-help information.\\n\\nI would not pay a counselor to deal with the thyroid problem your spouse has unless I was certain she/he really understood it. You can try asking the local hospital or the endo\\'s office if there is a support group or someone who can help or you can talk with.\\n\\nNo one can make anyone be patient, but that is what your husband needs right now, your patience. If he had cancer and was uncommunicative, it would be the same situation. Thyroid \"seems\" not as drastic as cancer, so we want people to just snap out of it...that is not realistic...he is physically ill, and depressed that he is ill on top of it.\\n\\nHe needs you to make space for his illness and deal with how you feel about it. Get some women friends and hobbies, be attentive as you would for an ill person. He IS ill.\\nThyroid imbalance is a draastic illness, that left untreated can become fatal.\\nHealing can be a terribly slow process.\\n\\nBut people DO recover, so there is hope.\\n\\nStay connected, tell him you are there for him, and try to think about how hard it is on him to be so ill he cannot function normally. He needs hope, and you have to be the one that thinks clearly so you don\\'t add to his discouragement.\\n\\nThe thyroid induced depression is horrible. I was practically suicidal at my worst before treatment, and did not want to live ike that.  You are not responsible for his attitude, but your attitude can exacerbate his depression. Just be with him where he is.\\nEmpathize, but don\\'t pity him.\\n\\nI hope this helps you. TF\\nHello:\\nOh you poor things. Please please please get the book, and also tell your husband this is NOT a woman\\'s disease, and have him go back through all these postings. I too am very depressed, go back and read my whole saga, it is too long for you to wade thru. I am not out of the woods yet. It takes a long time for this depression to come on and will take a long time for it (if ever in my case) to totally go away. I cannot find a doctor who will look at the book, yet alone try to have a T3/T4 conversation. I know I need T3, I know this is thyroid, but I\\'m being treated for depression. My endocrinologist was a disaster of killing magnitude, I could go on and on. You must try and be patient, sex is at the bottom of the list of importance right now, when it\\'ll come back, it will. You must be patient with him and yourself to see this through. I hope he reads the book. I have sent 2 male friends to the doc. for thryoid check, who\\'s docs\\' frankly said \"it\\'s a woman\\'s problem..\" and guess what, because they pushed, THEY ARE BOTH ON MEDICATION.  So it\\'s a human disease, very real, very serious to deal with but worst of all is the patience, there is no quick fix, pill, treatment. I wish there was an operation we could all have, and feel better in 2 weeks, there is not.  Be patient.  Come to this board, it is what keeps me going. We\\'re here to listen, and maybe help you.\\nGood luck\\nGD\\nThanks, Tree Frog and GD, for your words of encouragement.\\n\\nMy husband DOES NOT believe his thyroid is causing his depression nor is he interested in any boards. In fact, the only reason he is on thyroid meds at all is because I \"intervened\" to his doctor and pushed her to look at all his symptoms. HE IS ANGRY THAT I KNOW ABOUT THE THYROID - part of the \"privacy\" aspect of the depression, I guess. He says that if the meds get to be a pain, he\\'ll quit them!\\n\\nI have \"The Thyroid Solution\" and have been reading it as a bible. He is too proud (or depressed?) to read such books. I am relying on his doc to keep up with him and regulate anything - my husband will listen to a doctor but not any book -- at least not when he\\'s so highly depressed.\\n\\nI will try to be patient with his condition. I don\\'t mind about the sex when I see the depression is the horrible factor. It\\'s been only a little over a week but already I see the thyroid\\'s \"cycle\" --- he\\'s highly depressed again and I\\'m worried about his brain. His face is like he\\'s angry at me. I am in pain every day from what this disease is doing to him and what it\\'s doing to our marriage.\\n\\nI know it takes \"a while\\', but when might he start feeling ANY relief from the internal pain of the depression? I know it\\'s like a deep pit; he can\\'t climb out. When will it feel shallower so he isn\\'t despiaring and wanting to die?\\n\\nAre there any spouses out there who can add any comments at all? Can anyone drag a spouse to the board to write anything??\\nHi:\\nI know you are very anxious and frustrated and sad, mad, glad, over this entire depression situation. Your husband MUST accept this situation, and be thankful it is not cancer or worse. You are doing the right thing to be supportive, reading the book, and no, there\\'s no special day that the depression will lift. Will he go to counseling, I am going thru this exact same thing myself, except my husband is wonderful and supportive, but also frightened by the 2 headed monster I turn into sometimes.  It is a long process, I am not going to get into my whole long drawn out story because everyone\\'s reactions to medications, doctors, and therapies is different. Suffice to say, please try to have him sit and read our msgs. We are caring, informed, educated people that  are in the same boat, just we\\'re all paddling different ways.  How old is he, may I ask you?  I do think men in general have much harder times accepting illness, weaknesses, etc. than we women. We can accept these things and try to become informed. I have learned so much from the thyroid solution book, and this board it is amazing. It may not do ONE THING for me physically, but mentally it has helped me. You must be patient, try to understand, and maybe a push to a counselor couldn\\'t hurt may be underlying issues not resolved and this sent him over the top? I have found it does not take much.  Keep us posted, you are NOT alone.  My husband is here, I read him these posting as I see fit, and he is glad I have a place to turn to. He just is always suspicious of the \"people and stuff on the internet\" so are we all.  But trust this board it is very safe, monitored, etc.  They are very careful.  Please let us know how it is going, ok?\\nGD\\nPS--I went to counseling today and didn\\'t like what I heard, but you know what? I\\'m going back next Thurs. right on schedule. Only person who can help me is me!\\nHi Lumpy.\\nEven if my spouse got on the board he would only be able to say what you say about where I used to be.\\n\\nHe had to learn what he can control and what he can\\'t.\\n\\nYou may need to apolegize to your husband for taking charge of his responsibility...it is his after all, and men hate being mothered. It can take a LOT to get then to a doctor, my husband too! He has physical problems to deal with and has refused to see a doctor, but if I called his doctor he would be livid.\\n\\nIf he is that closed and angry, apolegize, explain you did not mean to mother him and back OFF.\\nAllow him space to cool off and wait.\\nI also would be livid if my spouse called my doctor for me without permission. He doesn\\'t want controlled and for good reason. But do tell him YOU need him to take his meds and see his doctor, for your own peace of mind. He may even do it for you when he might not do it for himself! But let him cool off before telling him that.\\n\\nThis really seems like a trust issue between you. We can\\'t get our own needs met by controlling the other person.\\n\\nIf I am off-base I apolegize...I don\\'t know either of you and am just sharing my own experience. TF\\nThanks TF and GD for your words.\\n\\nTo answer your questions, my husband is 42 and I\\'m almost 37. Actually, I\\'m not really lumpy either - it was a pet name he gave me; while I hated it the first time he called me that, now I will take ANY attention he will give me. Since it\\'s nothing now, I am calling myself something which helps me remember how he used to be.\\n\\nIt may be an invasion of his privacy to talk to his doctor but it\\'s over now. It felt good to understand his condition but the doctor won\\'t discuss it now. I just found out she is a nurse practictioner and won\\'t refer him to a doctor or endo unless my husband asks outright, on his own. Since he doesn\\'t believe his depression is related to his thyroid problems, he won\\'t ask. This means she didn\\'t discuss the thyroid:depression correlation with him. She probably didn\\'t tell him that if he stops the meds, his heart might give out also.\\n\\nHe\\'s not into self-help so it\\'s pointless to ask about reading any boards. He\\'s very proud and, until this illness, rather strong. He also tries to solve things alone - he was brought up that way. He tries to be \"ill\" ALONE when he has a cold, but this is more than a cold or flu. He also tends to leave himself alone when ill, so I\\'m concerned he won\\'t keep an eye on his own meds or his own health - remember, he doesn\\'t equate his symptoms or depression to \"stupid thyroid numbers\".\\n\\nThe most I am allowed to do is NOT LEAVE. It is my wish to try to get through this with lots of love, even if I gave to do it in different rooms - as in \"space\". Most women would leave a husband by now if they were so uncommunicative. Luckily, I have good friends and some good advice. I know most of what he says is the depression talking, but no health issue can get solved without his wanting it.\\n\\nSince he\\'s non-actively suicidal, I just don\\'t want him to be dead before he realizes he doesn\\'t have to suffer.\\n\\nSorry if I\\'m venting. It\\'s diffucult to see the man I married turned into a depressed hermit.\\nI know, it is very hard to love someone that is that closed off and proud.\\nYou truly have my empathy.\\n\\nI am not going to beat you up with this...it is his problem and we have to let people get to the point they actually want help.\\nMaybe a co-dependent women\\'s group would help you see how to disentangle your own emotions from what you cannot make happen.\\n\\nYou know, he may be depressed from the lack of control he has in life or other matters/issues, as well.\\nBut people that are closed usually do get more closed off from external pressure.\\n\\nSounds like he is not very cognizant of your needs to call you a name you dislike, regardless of being told. We do play a role in our relatiopnships that we often do not see, that contributes to issues we dislike...maybe you can use your energy to discover what you do in interactions that help keep things the way they are, and make some changes within yourself that will act as a catalyst. It has to be for self improvement not for mainpulation, though.\\nI have found this very effective in my marriage.\\nIt is very hard work: marriage! TF\\n\\nPS:\\nGee whiz!!! I called you that name too!\\n(I deleted it.) Please forgive me!\\nGD, thanks for making me aware!\\n...see , L, how we tend to do exactly what the other person abhors and don\\'t even see it?\\nIt is just human nature. But we can change!<p>[This message has been edited by Tree Frog (edited 05-06-2001).]\\nHi L----: I will not call you that \"name\". I would not like it either, even tho\\' I truly am a lumpy person to look at!  TF hit the nail on the head. Men are different with illnesses, what they perceive are weaknesses, etc. It\\'s this ridiculous Macho thing. But it is hard to break this, change it, mold it into an \"acceptance\" only he can do this.  You must think of yourself and how to deal with his problem at the same time. I was fearful when you said about being \"allowed\" I hope I interpreted that WRONG.   You are doing the best you can and if you have to blow off steam sometimes, he has to see what he is doing to you.  You cannot isolate your emotions either. It is a difficult balance. I am in counseling for ME.  My husband TG is very very good and supportive, but I find I cannot tell him one word I discuss with the therapist. This last session bothered me enormously (re: first husband\\'s death) she wants to scratch that surface and I have a tough time with that. I am \"avoiding\" this, but know that to be \"better\" I\\'d better get into it, perhaps it lies as part of the root of my depression, besides the lousy thyroid business, etc.  Patience is one thing none of us truly has in abundance, but try and keep reading the board. It\\'s too bad he won\\'t even listen to a few of the postings, we are here to help, if not logistically, then with our verbal support for you. Find a new name for yourself! How about\\n: Frustrated thyroid wife chick! I hope this makes you smile!\\nGet thru an hr. at a time, forget the day,it\\'s too long................little tips from a thryoider.\\nHappy Sunday\\nGD\\nDear GD and TF,\\nThanks for your words of wisdon, but please don\\'t think that I am really having problems with my \"pet name\" Lumpy! Actually, I have a good figure - I work hard at trying to be in shape. When my husband first started calling me that I didn\\'t like it, but I came to realize that he meant it lovingly, as in \"I\\'m lumpy in the right places\". It got so I\\'d smile when he called me that, because he meant that I was looking good to him.\\n\\nActually, the part where I am \\'allowed to NOT LEAVE\" is by my own power. I won\\'t leave him because something else has taken hold of him (thyroid), and he is battling internally because of the mental stresses.\\n\\nThe good news is that I think the med has finally started kicking in a bit. My husband seemed less tense over the weekend. I made sure to get out and do my own social activities but made sure to come back and spend time with him, even if it was just watching TV. I wanted to let him have the run of the house -- instead of feeling that to be alone, he had to shut himself in a room. It worked - I had a good time out, and he looked more relaxed when I returned.\\n\\nI know it will be about a month before he starts feeling even better, and possibly two months before he gets any joy back.  We\\'re about to start a highly stressful summer, so I hope everything goes okay.\\n\\nWe were supposed to be moving into a house being built. One of his \"depression-rants\" was that he just wanted to live in a basement apartment somewhere -- \"we can get our deposit back\" on the house. I\\'m worried about the whole house thing. I\\'ve got to discuss it with him this week, but I\\'m waiting for his meds to give him strength to deal with deep concepts like mortgages, moving, etc . . . .\\nHey!\\nBuyer\\'s remorse is cause for big-time depression! Buying property is a high stressor!\\n\\nMen talk out their emotions...no wonder you are bothered! No wonder HE is!\\n\\nBoth of you will get thru this I am confident!\\nI am glad you are feeling more hopeful! TF\\nTree Frog,\\n\\nYou seem like a wise woman. I am glad to verified the fact that buyers remorse could be a factor in generating the depression from my husband\\'s thyroid. Could you give me your knowledge in the following specific context, relating to the depression?\\n\\nHe definately is starting to perk up. Not alot, but he seems to have a bit more energy or less \"brain-fog\". He even invited me to a lecture tonight, and went with me to an antiques market. Then he seems to slip back again, no conversing, very alone, etc.\\n\\nHe is still saying that he doesn\\'t want our beautiful new house. He won\\'t go to SEE it even. He won\\'t take the house because \"then I can\\'t leave, or buy anything for myself, and I\\'m trapped.\" I have heard that some depressed thyroid patients won\\'t [can\\'t?] make any financial decisions. It\\'s as if there is no tomorrow, but there\\'s yet no hope even for today. He even feels so distant from me - this may be a reason he doesn\\'t want to pay for the house.\\n\\nThe builder have set the settlement (June 13)and walkthrough (May 31) dates, andthe lender is pressing for final paperwork for final approval. The builder has our deposit but we don\\'t even have a locked-in mortgage. Technically, we owe nothing. But if we pull out, they can sell the house AND keep the deposit.\\n\\nThe bad part is that *I* feel the great loss from the house. My husband feels nothing about anything. Well, he might be feeling less numb by now, but I have seen our beautiful house and been dreaming about it. Time is NOT on our side, due to settlement dates. I can\\'t tell whether his brain will make any better decisions soon or not. He can\\'t even fathom packing up the house, even if movers do it all. He just can\\'t deal with any part of this. In fact, he\\'d rather lose the $8000 deposit than face any problems.\\n\\nI know having his mental health is more important than some house, but in the last two days I am wondering whether I am sacrificing my values for what not even be a full mental/emotional recovery. He is saying he can\\'t love me like he used to. Maybe it\\'s still early in the process (it\\'s been almost 3 weeks on .025 Synthroid for him).\\n\\nYou said you felt suicidal also while in your depressed stages. I kept telling myself that \"A live husband without our own house is better than a dead husband in our rental home\". (We\\'ve been rentaing a house for 7 years, this was our custom home being built).I knew that the worries of the house were tearing him apart, when he even couldn\\'t stand to be in his own head, but less doing anything else. I was willing to make the sacrifice to get my old hubby back, but now I wonder whether whether I\\'m losing my dreams AND my hubby.\\n\\nTF, what does your experience tell you to tell me?\\nThis is just my opinion:\\nI think you have to be absolutely willing to let go of the house, because unless you are willing to and can afford to live in it and pay for it by yourself, it MUST be something both marriage partners agree with, for it to work out.\\n\\nI would suggest telling him that if he really doesn\\'t think it is good to buy the house and is willing to lose the deposit, then you will give up that dream for now, BUT it is on the condition HE tells the official people the deal is off. Tell him you are not the one that doesn\\'t want it, so he has to break the deal on paper.\\n\\nI know this is awfully hard, but if he resents the house it will eat your marriage alive, and you will lose in the long run, depression, thyroid or not! Many times one spouse may go along with things when there are not good feelings about it. But it isn\\'t good timing if both cannot agree.\\nThat means when both can agree, what you decide together will work much better.\\n\\nA nice new house is a lovely dream, but it is a great deal of stress, esp. if you over spent on the mortgage. You wouldn\\'t even have money for home repairs or vacations or fixing up the place. Actually my husband and I did that once, by agreement! And the result was very hard to live with!\\n\\nHe needs to get well, that should be the priority, regardless the outcome of that.\\nIf the situation were reversed and you disagreed, what then? You would want and rightly expect him to back down.\\n\\nBacking down lets him have his own space...he could even decide to keep the house, butr his desires have to have as much weight as yours.\\nThe point being that marriage requires giving where the other cannot.\\nHe cannot give right now in the matter of the house.\\nIt is as simple as that and as hard.\\n\\nIt isn\\'t easy.\\nBut marriage is hard work.\\nWe go into it thinking of all we are getting and find out it requires much more giving than we imagined. You obviously care very much and will do the right thing by him.\\nBelieve me, it will come back to you as a blessing to let go of your own desire for that house. But it must be done in love, not resentment on his part.\\nMaybe he really wanted to give you the house, but realized he just can\\'t face it.\\nI am going on vacation and will be gone for ten days, starting the 15th May, just so you all know and don\\'t worry.

       " {'post': 'In Dec 2000 my daughter, then 12 yrs old, was diagnosed with Graves disease.  She had lost about 15 lbs, was extremely hyper, her grades had dropped from all A\\'s to D\\'s & F\\'s. She could not go to sleep at night. She had just started 7th grade.  I just knew the kids she was hanging around with were bad\\nnews.  Little did \"I\" know. My mom insisted I take her to the dr., she even took her for me.  She told the dr to test her thyroid, which would not have been tested.   After the results came back, the dr. sent us to an endo dr.. He put her on Tapazole 3 times/day 10mg.  A few weeks ago I started noticing she was really tired, she did not want to do anything.  She would cry really easy.  Then a few days ago I noticed her thyroid was enlarged.  We went for her scheduled visit on Monday.  Now he says she possibly has Hashimoto\\'s.  He did a blood test, I don\\'t know what her #\\'s are yet.  He said he would call if the test showed something different. He wanted to put her on synthroid as well as keeping her on the Tapazole. I didn\\'t understand why he didn\\'t take her off a dose of Tapazole. He said it is optional, it is hard to get the right balance. So we are taking 2 doses Tapazole a day. I understand this is auto immune related, she also has Vitiligo.  What is next...is this normal to go back and forth?  I am still trying to learn about this.  I read everything I could on Grave\\'s.  This couldn\\'t be misdiagnosed, they did the TSH,T3,T4 test, she had all the symtoms.  So did the Tapazole push her this way? I have ask all these questions to the doc., now I\\'m just confused.   All I know is I need clear understanding of what we are dealing with. I realize she is 13 years old now her body is changing, this might make things harder to balance her thyroid.  Just thought I would see if you guys had any info to offer.  Thanks,  Kris\\nThank you Ser!  This website is very informative.\\nI was diagnosed with hashimoto\\'s back in 1997.  My dr. checks my thyroid every 3-6 months depending on how I am feeling.  I get very jumpy and have a hard time sleeping also during the time the thyroid is overactive. I am not on any throid replacements yet. I am now 27y/o and am doing very well with this. If you are in contact with your dr., hopefully he is checking this every 6 months at the most. It is not a disease that needs to be neglected by anymeans.\\nI have recently been diagnosed with Grave\\'s Disease...for the past 9 months I have been very ill with gastro problems and the hematologist picked thyroid problem on routine blood work...I have had uptake done, doctors placed me on tapazole, I was already on tenormin...levels got higher, doctor wanted to do radiation treatment to shrink thyroid but I had allergic reaction to idodine for uptake...we are doing nothing now as he removed me from the tapazole and has left me hanging!!!!!...does anyone have any suggestions as to where to go from here?:-(\\nThere are blood tests to check for antibodies that could confirm a Graves or Hashimoto\\'s diagnosis.\\n\\nI too had a thyroid uptake and scan test done prior to my firm diagnosis of Graves.  As well as the antibody tests and a thyroid ultrasound.\\n\\nThe thing that jumped out at me about your post about your daughter is this...when treating Graves with anti-thyroid drugs it is common to reduce the dosage as the thyroid levels return to a normal level.  Anyone on anti-thyroid meds should be monitored and have blood drawn at least every 3 months.  If the medication dosage is not reduced as thyroid levels normalize, that will cause an overmedication of anti-thyroid meds, and in turn will cause hypothyroidism.\\n\\nPersonally, my dosage has been consistently reduced to keep my levels in the normal range over the 2 years I\\'ve been on the med.  (Although my first Endo did overdose me on the med and sent me into a hypothyroid state for a while)\\n\\nIf possible, I would get a second opinion from another Endo.  If your choice of treatment is ATD\\'s then you need someone who is well versed at prescribing and following up.\\n\\nGood luck!!  And (((hugs))) to your daughter from one \"Gravie\" to another!\\n\\n\\n\\n------------------\\nSome days you\\'re the dog...some days you\\'re the hydrant!\\n(dx Graves 4/99, treatment w/Tapazole and Atenolol)\\nThanks for all the comments.  I just thought I would update you.  On 12/1/00 her TSH was &lt;.03,free T4 3.50,T4 19.3,T3 uptake 39%.  As of 5/10/01 her free T4 was .13,TSH was 160.04, yes that is 160.04. These 2 test were the only 2 ran on 5/10.  The Dr. has lowered her Tapazole to 1 tablet a day.  She will go back for a blood test on 6/11/01.  The dr. we are using is \"supposed\" to be one of the best.  I will be taking her for blood test every 30 days until I see some type of stability.  The test results from 5/10 explain why she can hardly move.  I wonder if her thyroid could have had a imbalance for a long time without us knowing.\\nThanks again!  Kris\\nKriss33,  The small amount of radio active iodine could have brought her back in range for a time.  This happened to me and I didn\\'t get checked again until I could not conceive(3 yrs).  I figured that I went back to Hyper about 6-9 mo after the RAI uptake. I wish you the best.<p>[This message has been edited by ser (edited 05-29-2001).]\\nKris, just my humble opinon here...but I would be mad as a hornet if my doc let me get THAT hypothyroid!!!  There is absolutely *NO* excuse for a doctor, who is supposed to be monitoring levels, would let anyone go so far as to have a TSH of 160!!!\\n\\nThe practice of taking Tapazole and Synthroid at the same time is commonly referred to as \"Block and Replace Therapy\" or BRT.  There was a Japanese study that showed promising rates of remission many years ago....since then other studies have not been able to duplicate the high success rates of the Japanese study.  BRT has it\\'s drawbacks as does all of the treatment options.  BRT generally requires higher doses of the anti-thyroid drug (Tap or PTU) and meds at the higher dosages increase the chance of serious side effects from the medication (or so I\\'ve read).  Also with BRT, your TSH will be suppressed which can lead to bone density loss...just as a suppressed TSH while hyperthyroid leads to bone density loss.\\n\\n(Hope that all made sense...I know it\\'s  lot to absorb)\\n\\nI would recommend that you get copies of all of your daughters lab work.  Keep a file at home.  Look for yourself on the lab report and see where your daughter\\'s blood is testing.  The lab report will have the reference range for \"normal\" listed right on the report.  Once you get the hang of it they are easy to read.\\n\\nBest of luck to you and your daughter....my heart goes out to you both!!\\n\\n\\n\\n------------------\\nSome days you\\'re the dog...some days you\\'re the hydrant!\\n(dx Graves 4/99, treatment w/Tapazole and Atenolol)',\n",

My doctor just checked my thyroid about 2 weeks ago (I had my thryoid removed 2 years ago) and said my TSH was way too low.  So she took me off of my Synthroid.  Does too low of TSH mean I am hyperthyroid?  And if it is too low, then why wouldn\\'t she increase my dose, rather than lowering it.  Also, I am gaining weight like crazy and I thought most hyperthyroid people lose weight like crazy.  Can someone please shed some light on all of this.  I am so confused!  Thanks a bunch!  PS I also have gallstones.  Could this make my TSH levels messed up and cause weight gain?\\nA good way to remember is that synthroid is your thyroid T4 so if you increase your med levels you were low(hypo) and if you lower your med levels you were high(hyper).\\n\\nSo keep that in mind ... TSH if it is low your T4 will be high (hyper) too much med so they should lower the dose. and in reverse if your TSH is high your T4 will be low (hypo) too little med and they should increase your dose.\\n\\nI hope I got it right correct me if I have it backwards.  TSH will be the reverse of your T4\\n<p>[This message has been edited by ser (edited 11-22-2000).]\\nOkay, here is what confuses me.  The blood order had TSH checked as the blood test to do.  All the dr told me was the test came back too low, so she took me off of my Synthroid all together.  So even after what you told me, I am still confused.  I started out my synthroid at .075, then they took me down to .050 and then down to .025, then off of it altogether.  Now I am gaining weight terribly and so exhausted.  I am so confused.\\nOK Are you eating more?  Really look at your calories.  I eat more when hyper.  She took you off because you were getting to much T4.  it takes about 7 weeks to see the change in your t4 levels.  You may just have to wait it out and see.

One of them got them before starting thyroid, whenever she drank coffee, or red wine, or ate MSG.  Then I read in Langer\\'s book, \"Solved: the Riddle of Illness\", that low thyroid reduces the absorption of copper.  And a symptom of copper deficiency is cardiac/ekg abnormalities  (it probably helped make the connection since I was having palps at the time I was reading it).  He mentioned that the amount to take is 4 mg.  I was already on 2 mg. and still had the palps, so I got a B vit. with 2 more mg.  After a couple weeks, I realized that I hadn\\'t felt palps in awhile, they didn\\'t return until I ran out of B\\'s and didn\\'t get around to replacing them for awhile.  Then I got more copper and they went away again.  BTW, I got more helpful information in his book than many other thyroid books including Arem\\'s.

I hope it helps\\n\\n\\nThyroiditis, an inflammation of the thyroid gland, produces transient hyperthyroidism often followed by transient hypothyroidism or no change in thyroid function at all.\\n\\nThe three types of thyroiditis are\\n\\n\\nHashimoto\\'s thyroiditis (autoimmune thyroiditis) is the most common type of thyroiditis and the most common cause of hypothyroidism. For unknown reasons, the body turns against itself in an autoimmune reaction, creating antibodies that attack the thyroid gland. (see page 816 in Chapter 168, Immunodeficiency Disorders) This type of thyroiditis is most common in elderly women and tends to run in families. The condition occurs eight times more often in women than in men and may occur in people with certain chromosomal abnormalities, including Turner\\'s, Down, and Klinefelter\\'s syndromes.\\n\\nHashimoto\\'s thyroiditis often begins with a painless enlargement of the thyroid gland or a feeling of fullness in the neck. When doctors feel the gland, they usually find it enlarged, with a rubbery texture, but not tender; sometimes it feels lumpy. The thyroid gland is underactive in about 20 percent of the people when Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis is discovered; the rest have normal thyroid function. Many people with Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis have other endocrine disorders such as diabetes, an underactive adrenal gland, or underactive parathyroid glands, and other autoimmune diseases such as pernicious anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren\\'s syndrome, or systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus).\\n\\nDoctors perform thyroid function tests on blood samples to determine whether the gland is functioning normally, but they base the diagnosis of Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis on the symptoms, a physical examination, and whether the person has antibodies that attack the gland (antithyroid antibodies), which can easily be measured in a blood test.\\n\\nNo specific treatment is available for Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis. Most people eventually develop hypothyroidism and must take thyroid hormone replacement therapy for the rest of their lives. Thyroid hormone may also be useful in decreasing the enlarged thyroid gland.\\n\\n\\nSubacute granulomatous (giant cell) thyroiditis, which is probably caused by a virus, begins much more suddenly than Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis. Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis often follows a viral illness and begins with what many people call a sore throat but actually proves to be neck pain localized to the thyroid. The thyroid gland becomes increasingly tender, and the person usually develops a low-grade fever (99° F. to 101° F.). The pain may shift from one side of the neck to the other, spread to the jaw and ears, and hurt more when the head is turned or when the person swallows. Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis is often mistaken at first for a dental problem or a throat or ear infection.\\n\\nInflammation usually causes the thyroid gland to release excessive thyroid hormones, resulting in hyperthyroidism, almost always followed by transient hypothyroidism. Many people with subacute granulomatous thyroiditis feel extremely tired.\\n\\nMost people recover completely from this type of thyroiditis. Generally the condition goes away by itself within a few months, but sometimes it comes back or, more rarely, damages enough of the thyroid gland to cause permanent hypothyroidism.\\n\\nAspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen) can relieve the pain and inflammation. In very severe cases, doctors may recommend corticosteroids such as prednisone, which should be tapered off over 6 to 8 weeks. When corticosteroids are stopped abruptly, symptoms often return in full force.\\n\\n\\nSilent lymphocytic thyroiditis occurs most often in women, typically just after childbirth, and causes the thyroid to become enlarged without becoming tender. For several weeks to several months, a person with silent lymphocytic thyroiditis has hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism before eventually recovering normal thyroid function. This condition requires no specific treatment, although the hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism may require treatment for a few weeks. Often, a beta-blocker such as propranolol is the only drug needed to control the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. During the period of hypothyroidism, a person may need to take thyroid hormone, usually for no more than a few months. Hypothyroidism becomes permanent in about 10 percent of the people with silent lymphocytic thyroiditis.\\n\\n\\nTake care\\nLori\\n\\n\\n\\n------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy homeopath gave the following recommendation for post-surgery trauma.  You can find homeopathic remedies in natural food stores, but I recommend retaining the advice of a known practitioner prior to use.\\n\\nTo take a homeopathic remedy, tap one sugar pill into the cap of the vial, but DO NOT TOUCH THE PILL. Tap the cap to release the pill under your tongue and let it dissolve completely. Do not eat or drink anything 10 minutes before a dose and 20 minutes after the pill dissolves. You increase the dosage by taking pills more frequently, NOT by taking more pills.  It is also recommended that you avoid mint and its relatives (camphor, menthol, tea tree oil) during homeopathic treatment.  Fennel toothpaste is useful for this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas recommended to aid the healing process. My homeopath says that Arnica is relatively benign, has no side effects, and cannot be overdosed.\\n\\nThe best case is to begin the Arnica\\nthe surgery:  Take one pellet three times a day, the day before the surgery.\\n\\nFor post-surgical trauma, I was told to take one pellet as soon as possible following surgery, followed by one pill every 15 minutes if pain is severe for up to 1 hour. Then take 1 pellet every 1-3 hours. The next day, taper off (as needed) but continue one pellet, three times a day for a week or more after the surgery.\\n\\nThis should help you with the pain, swelling, and any potential bruising.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas recommended.\\nTake one pellet as needed, up to every 15 minutes for the first hour.  Then taper off.  I found I needed three doses in the first hour, then two more doses (one in each of the next two hours) as the anesthesia left my body.\\n\\nToo much Phosphorus can make you constipated (as can the anesthesia), so use sparingly as needed.\\n\\n[This message has been edited by ArtfulD (edited 02-06-2002).]\\n\\n\\nIn the August 7th, Woman\\'s World magazine, found in virtually every grocery store where magazines are sold, on pages 14-16, they have some great exercises that really works the inner middle body muscles like a girdle.\\n\\nThey were developed by an exercise physiologist,Teresa Tapp. Get that magazine, if interested. It has all the info you really need.\\n\\nI did these exercises just two days and can feel the mucles tightening around my middle already. The exercises are really easy and don\\'t hurt bad joints, such as I have.\\n\\nI am really excited, because this routine really works up a sweat in 20-30 minutes and is incredibly easy.\\n\\n\\n\\n[This message has been edited by moderator1 (edited 09-26-2001).]\\nFoods that can can affect your thyroid negatively:\\n\\nI put together a fairly complete list of goitrogens some time ago. Here\\'s what I came up with, but I am sure tyhere are othere things that can and will be added over time.\\n\\nAvoid unless cooked thouroughly:\\n\\n* African cassava\\n* Asparagus\\n* babassu (a palm-tree coconut fruit popular in Brazil and Africa)\\n* Broccoli\\n* brussels sprouts\\n* Cabbage\\n* Cauliflower\\n* horseradish\\n* kale\\n* kohlrabi\\n* leafy green vegetables (turnip greens, mustard greens, collard greens)\\n* Legumes (beans and peas)\\n* peanuts\\n* pine nuts\\n* Processed meats\\n* radishes\\n* rutabaga\\n* Spinach\\n* turnips\\n* Watercress\\n\\nAvoid entirely:\\n\\n* Soy in any form that isn\\'t fermented\\n* millet (actually WORSE when cooked)\\n* Rapeseed, canola, flax, soybean, safflower, corn and other polyunsaturated fats/oils\\n\\nQuestions to ask a potential doctor:\\n\\nA friend posted this fantastic list of questions that she composed to another message board.  I asked her if I could post it here, and this is her gracious response: \"You can use it as much as you want.  Power to the patient! ... \\'Nette\"\\n\\nHere\\'s the list:\\n\\na. What is your approach to treating hypo?\\n\\nDesired answer:  treatment is based on a combination of symptoms and lab tests.  (What lab tests?  TSH, antibodies (once is usually enough), free or total T3 and free T4 are good places to start).\\n\\nb.  What medications do you use in treatment of hypo?\\n\\nDesired answer: whatever if takes.  Some of those available are Synthroid, Thyrolar, Cytomel and natural meds like Armour.\\n\\nWrong answer:  Synthroid only.\\n\\nc.  If I don\\'t feel well when my labs are within the normal ranges, what do you do?\\n\\nDesired answers:  the normal ranges are just guidance, and there is often lots of room to play within the normal ranges.   If that doesn\\'t work, we have to consider things in addition to the thyroid for contributing to symptoms.\\n\\nWrong answer:  If normal ranges don\\'t make you feel well, it is all in your head.\\n\\nd.  What is your response to me asking about different approaches that I\\'ve read about on the internet or in books?\\n\\nDesired answer:  There is a lot of great info on the internet and books and some lousy info so one has to be selective.  Don\\'t hesitate to share the things you\\'ve learned about and we can discuss them in context to your treatment.  I always enjoy getting new articles from professional publications about evolving methods.\\n\\nWrong answer: stay away from the internet, there is only rubbish out there.\\n\\ne.  How long does it take for me to get well, or at least see some improvement?\\n\\nDesired answer:  It is a slow process because your body has a lot of healing to do plus it takes a well to optimize your meds for your body.  However, you should have made a lot of improvement in four to six months.\\n\\nWrong answer:  2 weeks or \"never\".\\n\\nf.  How often to you do tests and see me while we are in the optimization process?  (Right answer is about every six weeks to 2 months).\\n\\nWrong answer: once a year.\\n\\ng.  Once I\\'m stable, how often do you monitor.\\n\\nGood answer:  every 4 to six months for a couple of years.  If you are absolutely stable then once a year should be enough unless you are starting to show symptoms again, then you should call me.\\n\\nWrong  answer:  once a year no matter what.',\n",

       " {'post': \"Recently diagnoed with hyperthyroidism, my symptoms are classic.  Weight loss, rapid heart rate, tremor, insomnia, heat intolerance, brittle nails.  A week after I started my anti-thyroid med, now I've been diagnosed with leukocytopenia too.  Is this from the hyperthyroid or the anti-thyroid medication?  I was told that the medicine might affect my blood count.  My sypmtoms have been going on for over six months and just keep getting worse.  I'm frustrated and near the end of my rope.  If anyone has had any experience with hyperthyroid, write to me.  Sometimes sharing similar experiences can be helpful.\\n\\n\\n------------------\\nIn Light, Love and Peace. Cathy\\nHi Cathy,\\n\\nI don't really have any comments about leukocytopenia, since I am not even sure what that is.  However I do understands and have compasion about the symptoms of the hyperthyroid.\\n\\nSince you have started taking medication, have you gained any weight or have you had other side effects.\\n\\nYou see I have't seen the specialist as of yet, still waiting for my appointment.  But my thyroid has been hyper for the past year and a bit, I just didn't really show any symptoms, or I passed them off as something else, until recently.  I have though always had weight problems my whole life.  However I have been happy about my weight in the past couple of years.  Although since September I have lost 7lbs and in the last week 3lbs.  To which I am not concerned all that much, only good thing about hyper.  I am not underweight by no means, but comfortable.  But I do have concerns that I could go on the opposite once again.\\n\\nAny help you can give would be great.  Also what questions did you ask your doctor?\\n\\nWendy\\nHi Wendy.\\n\\nLeukocytes are part of the blood count.  White cells, I'm pretty sure.  The ones that fight disease and infection. Mine are low.\\n\\nI was just diagnosed about a month ago but my symptoms had been going on for nearly a year - like yours, only they came up one at a time and they were treated as something else.  I was very lucky that my primary care physician decided to test my TSH.  Within a week I was at the hospital for a scan and uptake.  Two weeks later, I was in with a specialist for treatment.\\n\\nThe first thing I did was do all the research I could.  About hypo and hyper thyroid.  What causes it, what the symptoms are and how it's treated.  I didn't have many questions to ask my specialist, however, we spent nearly an hour and a half together during my consultation.  He explained the why's, how's and pro's and con's of treatment.  He showed me diagrams and told me how the thyroid works.  Although radioactive iodine is a very popular treatment, my symptoms are so severe, he decided to treat them first (with the anti-thyroid medication).\\n\\nI've lost weight, too, and I'm not real thrilled about it.  I'm a 34-year-old, single mother who can't play with my two year old son like I used to.  I get too tired and it hurts too much to get up and down off the floor.  My muscles are weak and atrophied and I can barely lift him out of bed.  I type for a living and my tremors have gotten so bad that I takes me twice as long to do the work I used to do.  My insomnia is getting worse, I go for weeks at a time with only about an hour of sleep a night - tossing and turning and before finally giving up.\\n\\nThe specialist did tell me that the anti-thyroid medication would kick in and reduce my symptoms in about a week.  It's been over a week.  Now my blood count is low and I may have to go off the medicine anyway.\\n\\nHe also told me that most of the patient's he's treated that have lost weight - usually gain it back.  Sorry to burst your bubble.  I for one, don't intend on gaining all of it back, though.. like you, I have struggled with my weight, too.  As much as I don't mind the weight loss as a symptom, the other symptoms that I do have really overshadow that one.\\n\\nThanks for responding, Wendy.  If you have any questions that I might be able to answer, please let me know.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I almost feel guilty for feeling so good and not sharing the info, cause I know it might help someone. For quite a while now I have been reading posts on this board and it seems like we all have the same symptoms in one way or another, but the doctor\\'s can\\'t find anything that could explain all of the pains we feel. Although I have been diagnosed with a hiatal hernia almost 9 years ago and I still had it 1 month ago when I had another endoscopy. There is nothing else physically wrong with me. I have had a colonoscopy, CT scans, ultrasound, barium, everything.  My symptoms were pain after I eat, terrible, horrible heartburn that made me miss work and walk the floor all night and it got to the point that I just could NOT eat anything except white rice. My body was in a constant spasm and it felt like someone was twisting a knife under my ribcage Someone on this board suggested I try some Magnesium supplements to calm the nervous system.  I can\\'t even believe how good I feel. NO MORE NEXIUM! Did you all know magnesium was necessary to activate protein digestive enzymes and it is a natural antacid? and a deficiency of it will cause spasms (that under the ribcage pain). I have also been taking a pancreatic digestive supplement found at the health food store and the gas and bloating and heartburn is GONE.  Now, I can\\'t stop eating, because nothing bothers me anymore.  The PPI\\'s I have been taking so long, prohibt your stomach from producing stomach acid which prohibts proper food digestion, which supports heartburn.  I take the pancreatic supplement to help breakdown the proteins and fat from foods.  Research the miracle of Magnesium. I\\'m sure it will change someone elses life.  I hope this helps.\\nYou find magnesium supplements in the same aisle you would find vitamins.  They sell it with calcium and zinc together in one pill, I also have some of those but I find I still need the actual magnesium supplement by itself first.  I take the other one just for the calcium benefit.  Good luck to you.\\nMy pain is also on the right side under rib cage and have had all the test done for gallbladder and they all come out saying gallbladder is fine.\\nHey Suzy and Boo-Boo,\\nmy experience has been that the pain was a gnawing type pain that was constant under the ribcage.  I also think that the many years of using ppi\\'s to reduce acid was a major factor in all of my problems.  the medicine reduced the amount of acid your stomach produces and then your food can\\'t breakdown, then you get heartburn, bloated and gassy from the food backing up and take more antacids.  It\\'s a cycle, the supplements help so much it\\'s incredible. They help to activate digestive enzymes and breakdown your food. My pain was on the left and somewhat in the middle and it went straight through to the back and it was painful.\\n\\n[This message has been edited by bluepumkin (edited 07-31-2003).]\\nI have never heard of that before.  What does your doctor say about it or has he/she said anything at all.  My doctor just gives me another script for another pill and never listens to my symptoms.  I don\\'t have constant pain on the left side but I have had it before and it is no fun.  My biggest problem is more with reflux than burn.  I always feel the food sitting in my throat.  I always feel like I have bad breath.  Does any of this sound familiar?\\n\\n------------------\\n\\nMartinifreak,\\nI showed the doctor everything I was taking and told him that I discontinued the Nexium. He looked everything over and said \"fine\".  I couldn\\'t figure out what that pain was at first but then I realized it was a spasm when I went to the hospital and morphine took it away for a little while.  The food getting stuck feeling... It\\'s like you beat your chest trying to make it go down,  right... if it\\'s even really in there.  No more spasms and no more heartburn.  I really really think that those PPI\\'s and antacids have a rebound effect just like painkillers.  They work for a while then you take more and more with no relief. Everything is gone and I feel better.\\nHi bluepumkin,\\n\\nYou know the way I got involved with nutrition and alternative medicine was I had Protate problems for several years and went to see several doctors including 2 Urologist.\\n\\nA regular family doc told me about his Dad that had the same problem and was cure with vitamin/ mineral supplement and  he gave me some Zinc/ Vitamin C capsules ---- 3 days later I was well!!\\n\\nI thought that if I am lacking Zinc and Vitamin C in my diet then I must be lacking some others nutrients as well. So, I bought a book \" Let Eat Right To Keep Fit\" and since then I have gotten alot more into Homeopathy, Herbal medicine and Nutritional Medicine, Bach Flower remedies, Cell salts as well as regular Medicine.\\n\\nI now am a big believer in--- Lack of Knowledge is poor excuse for Bad Health !!!\\n\\nYour life has been truely changed by a mineral --magnesium!!!\\n\\nHarry\\n\\n[This message has been edited by Harry (edited 08-03-2003).]\\nThe magnesium idea sounds great but....I have been doing some research and it\\'s to my understanding that too much of it can react as a laxative and also can cause kidney damage. So how much would a person know to take plus all the magnesium a person would get from food?\\nJacklyn,\\nPart of the problem is that we are not getting it in our foods, the soil is so depleted we don\\'t get nearly the nutrients are grandparents did.  Yes, magnesium can have a laxative effect if you take too much... but why would you overdose on a magnesium pill.  Have you ever noticed that some antacids have magnesium in them.  Look at the label.  That\\'s why it\\'s makes more sense to just take the supplement to cut the neutralize the acid. If I have said it once I will say it again.   Those acid reducers are the problem.  You need acid to digest your food.  Without it we get more heartburn and more gas.  It has worked wonders for me.  you\\'ll see.\\nHarry,\\nThis whole \"illness thing\" has really turned me on to homeopathic medicine too.  I have been seeing doctors for years with no good advice.  They prescribe more acid reducers and I thought I\\'ve been on Prilosec, tagamet, zantac, prevacid, aciphex and nexium and STILL have heartburn, is this how I\\'m going to have to live the rest of my life and I\\'m only in my early 30\\'s. They are only masking the illness by treating the symptoms but not getting to the root of the problem.  I\\'ll still go to the doctor, but I know to educate myself if I really want to feel better.\\nBluepumkin,\\nThanks for replying. I agree with what you said about acid reducers. That\\'s just why I didn\\'t fill my prescription for them. Instead, I am trying CidaBan DGL\\nwhich is a dietary supplement for indigestion and heartburn. The key ingredient is licorice root. If this doesn\\'t work, I will try magnesium.  Thanks for sharing.\\nHi\\nThank you for your\"e reply I think I will try your advise.Mine just seemed to have gotten worse over the last 2 months. I think the Nexium was making me worse.I think I have a new ang different pain every day .Thanks again I\\'ll let you know how things go,\\nBluepumpkin,\\nI have been suffering with the exact same thing as you (symptoms). Have had numerous tests and blood work-ups. I have been dealing w/ Gastro. doc and most recently a surgeon (hiatal hernia/gallbladder??). I have taken Protonix (did NOTHING), Donotol Extendtabs (abdominal spasms) and most recently Nexium which after 2 days I quit as I was so sick I couldn\\'t get out of bed !\\nHarry (member here) suggested on Saturday a.m. that I get \"Magnesium Phosphorica\" @ the health food store. I immediately went there (desperate for some sort of pain relief) and got a bottle. They are tiny little round pellets. The clerk told me to put 3/5 under my tongue, 3 times per day (they taste like sugar pills).\\nApparently they are very popular according to the clerk. It says on the bottle, for abdominal spasms.\\nI responded w/ a post to Harry yesterday morning expessing my gratitude for recomending them as I was ALREADY feeling better ! I have been using them since and I have to say I agree w/ your comments, I am feeling SO MUCH BETTER !!!

I am so happy to hear of another person who has found relief from this phantom illness.  I can\\'t even begin to describe the pain I was in.  I\\'m sure you already know. The doctors thought I was crazy because all of my tests came back negative.  I think the PPI\\'s have a lot to do with the spasms, because now that I\\'ve quit taking all prescribed medicine I feel a lot better.\\nsounds great,now what im wondering is how do probiotics work into all of this? is it somethign we can stop taking or take them along with the magnesium ? and is this helpful with the gas and bloating from IBS ?\\n\\n[This message has been edited by EchoeB42 (edited 09-29-2003).]',\n",

A dietition could help.  You need to choose a life diet change by eating right avoiding certain items and adding other elements in. Exercise is important I like to walk some people like to lift weights or run. Find an activity you enjoy and do it.  What was the other test the Dr is doing?  Weighing Food - once you know what a potion is you can eye it.  I have never used a scale, until recently I have eaten small portions automaticly.\\nHi, Many times what a doc says is normal is not normal for US!\\nPlease read the article link about TSH in the \"information archive\" topic.\\n\\nI was very ill within the so-called normal TSH lab range. Now with a TSH at the much lower end, if I eat normally (no binging on empty carbs and sugars) I lose weight. I  am not eating right during the holidays, tho, I admit.\\n\\nDr. Arem\\'s book, The Thyroid Solution has much info to help find the balance we need as thyroid patients needing to lose weight. TF\\nHi SARS, I too was in your position - \\'supposedly\\' normal and not losing weight - in fact gaining!!! I would eat 800 calories a day and exercise 6 days a week and nothing!!! Very frustrating - however, after reading the Thyroid Solution and cutting out simple carbs and sugars - I started to lose weight!! I also went to another doctor and he put me on natural thryroid and my whole life was returned to me!!! I couldn\\'t believe the difference in how I felt and looked. I have lost 20 pounds since January of this year. Slow I know but at least it is going in the right direction. I have 15 more pounds to go. There is light at the end of the tunnel don\\'t give up - this site was a life saver for me!!! Lot\\'s of luck. Q\\nHi again,\\nIt also may be that you are still undermedicated, though your seemingly in the normal lab range.\\nI have lost 34lbs since july 2001. I am doing a low carb diet. I have taken synthroid for the last ten years. Books to read\\n\\nThe Carbohydrate Addict by Drs. Heller\\nAnd  the Carbohydrate Addicts Lifespan Program  by Drs. Heller.\\nI have only been on meds since Oct 2000.  I had gained over 20 pounds and now they are coming off.  I had started to wear my husband\\'s jeans because mine no longer fit.  Since the discovery of hypothyroidism, I have changed what I eat.  I bought the book Sugar Busters, and already this week I was able to wear my jeans again.  With this book and walking at 3 times a week for at least 20 minutes, I have been able to lose some weight.  I don\\'t know how much, but I can wear my jeans again!!! <IMG SRC=\"http://www.healthboards.com/ubb/smile.gif\">\\n\\n\\n------------------\\nHello Sars:\\nI can certainly sympathize with you. If you look at my post you can see we are in a similar situation. I basically agree with everyone here, regarding the importance of\\nphysical activity, calorie reduction and better food choices.Yet I think when we are dealing with thyroid disease and many of its side effects- lethargy, lack of energy, depression, etc it can be  so hard to get motivated.\\nWhen the thyroid gland is removed surgically or via Radio Active Iodine most people then become hypothyroid (my situation)which in turn has an enormous effect on our metabolism and hormone levels which ultimately effect\\nweight gain/loss etc.\\nI know that Synthroid and similar thyroid meds are supposed to supplement our\\nmissing thyroid, and I believe they are vital in helping this process along, but it is a balancing act. Just because our bloodwork comes back within a\"normal\" range  does necessarily mean we all FEEL normal, as Im sure many people here can attest to. Im still working on that one.\\nMy understanding from reading numerous books, articles and speaking with my endocrinologist, is that it is possible to stop weight gain and begin to lose weight, but it is MUCH harder for those\\nwho have had their thyroid gland disolved or removed.\\nWe have to work twice as hard for many of the reasons\\nmentioned above.\\nSo I dont think I have provided you with much of a\\nsolution, but I do understand\\nthe frustration you must be feeling.\\nI would suggest that along with trying to alter your diet and increase physical activity I would also ask your MD about your medications, increasing/decreasing changing from synthetic, ex. Synthroid, Levoxel to a natural med- Thyrolar or Armour and perhaps a supplement of Cytomel.\\nAlthough I am starting a medically supervised liquid\\ndiet program, I am going to also ask my MD about my meds.\\nI am doing this type of diet as I am just gaining (and eating) WAY too much and too fast, and it is both physically and mentally draining. This diet certainly isnt for everyone, but I plan on doing it to get off my initial poundage,as I need to\\nget a jump start, and see some results fairly quickly.\\nSorry to go on for so long. Let us know how you are doing.\\nJudith\\nJudith,\\nIt is really good to \"see\" you here again.\\n\\nMy TSH has changed from .34 where I felt pretty good and could lose weight, to .66 and I have gained 10 pounds, am cold, have brittle fingernails again, and lower body temperature, and sleepiness...AND I have been on a supplement of T3...go figure!\\nI see my doc on Monday, and am very interested in what she will say.\\n\\nI think I was much better on just T4 (Levoxyl).',\n",

       " {'post': 'I\\'ve just discovered this board, and it\\'s enormously helpful as a source of information on thyroid disorders.\\n\\nI was diagnosed with hypothyroidism by my gp about 2 years ago, and have been taking synthyroid (0.1 mg/day) since then.  Believe it or not, I was very excited with the diagnosis, because it seemed to explain a lot:  years of mild to severe depression, lethargy, memory loss, lack of concentration and weight retention.  Sadly (no pun intended), however, I believe that the daily medication does not seem to have made any difference in the above-symptoms.\\n\\nMy question:  I am a 37 year old male, and I wonder if there are other men out there with hypothyroidism who could share their experience (positive or negative) with diagnosis, medication and lifestyle changes?  I understand from my reading that hypothyroidism does not affect as many men as women.\\nMy story is on this board, written 1/1/01 if you want to read. I was diagnosed about 1 1/2 years ago and have been through Levoxyl and now on Synthroid. I feel better but not \"myself\" yet, Maybe I need to up the dose, I\\'ll find out next month. I also suffered from inner ear problem and lightheadedness at the same time this came on. I went through a Cat scan, MRI of the brain, hearing tests, etc. and the DR said I \"may\" have Mineare\\'s disease, live with it. Many of the symptoms have decreased as my thyroid med has increased.\\n\\nI suffered panic/anxiety attacks and didn\\'t want to leave the house for a few months. I bought the book The Thyroid Solution and it helped me deal with what was happening, as did some of the nice ladies on this board.\\nI still have moments of anxiety but not as bad, and I have learned how to deal with them. I cannot lose weight which is very frustrating. I am a soon to be 50 years old with two boys ages 12 and 8. I coach soccer and baseball and want to be active in their lives and weight loss has become my crusade.\\nI don\\'t post often but do read these boards just about everyday. The ladies here are very well informed (especially Tree Frog) and can probably offer advice that is better than mine. For me it was changes in lifestyle (remove or reduce stress levels) and believe in your body and minds ability to conquer this illness. Good luck and I hope I have helped a little.\\nHey, just turned 38, male, got diagnosed about 6 months ago or so.\\n\\nI haven\\'t been keeping up with my condition, but am taking 2 grains of Armor thyroid.  I think it helps me feel better.\\n\\nTake care and welcome to this board,\\nMichael\\nHow funny, I began this reply hours ago, and was so surprised when I refreshed the page to see other answers pop up!  <IMG SRC=\"http://www.healthboards.com/ubb/cool.gif\">\\n\\n\\nWelcome, RS, and Hopefully some men will answer. This board is for both males and females!\\nIn my opinion, the only reason thyroid disorders are more prevalent in females is we have those frequent hormone changes to get rebalanced, so our thyroids have more work to do and get worn out faster. maybe females take more prescription drugs too, that work the thyroid. Every chemical change works the thyroid.\\n\\nThe thyroid med alone only makes us ABLE to heal, we still need to do many changes to help. That is, if we are on sufficient thyroid med. If you are still symptomatic you can request a trial raise of med.\\n\\nAlso, I always recommend the book The Thyroid Solution as a thyroid \"bible\" .\\nIt has much info how we can and need to help ourselves that will get rid of the lingering symptoms.\\n\\nI hope you keep coming back, and let us know how you are doing.

Glad to see Treefrog is still here!!!\\nI am basically freaking out about my significant continuous weight gain. I was hyperthyroid for 7 years and finally had RAI in Sept.1999\\nThough I have always struggled with my weight, this is the biggest Ive ever been. I know what to eat and how etc. and the importance incorperating weights and physical activity. I also know I am having too many calories, but not enough to substantiate such rapid dramatice weight gain. I am also sooo exhausted!! My lab levels are now basically within normal range, but I feel listless. I try to do my nordic track and walking, but as Im so tired,\\nand feel so fat its tuff to be\\nconsistant. I am on .2 mcg of\\nbrand name synthroid.\\nHas anyone experienced this,\\nor been in a similar situation?\\nI am wondering about the difference between Armour and Synthroid, and if changing over may help.\\nFinally does anyone know if\\nDHEA plays a role in thyroid\\ndisorders, or if Pituitary gland and thyroid gland problems are related?\\nAny info or advice is appreciated. Thank you!\\nJUDITH!!!!!\\nI have thought about you so much and have wished you were here when people need info and support concerning hyperthyroidism, which I have no personal experience with.\\n\\nI know you are busy, but I hope you can stay around for awhile, at least.\\n\\nIt is good to hear from you, though I am sorry your news is frustration. Maybe we can help some. Have you read the articles in the inforamtion archive topic on this board?\\n\\nIt may be you are not on enough thyroid med, yet. Mine had been doubled then tripled. I was started on the lowest dose, then finally got a doctor that was not going to play around. She upped my med a lot, until I went hyper, and then back down a bit. I now can lose weight if I back off the sugar and simple carbs.\\n\\nWhat is the TSH they say is normal?\\nIt may not be normal for YOU! Mine is TSH .34, last time it was checked, and I feel pretty good. At 5.6 I was SUFFERING, and at just 2 was disabled from work.\\nLab ranges do not say what level is best for YOU.\\n\\nThere is hope, and a lot of new information.\\nI look forward to hearing back from you. TF\\nJudith, So glad to see you on the board again.  Like tree frog I feel beter at .4-.5 TSh I am at 1.59 right now and depresed but try to get the Dr to see that..ha  I have an appointment with another Dr in March but right know I am trying Celexa. (see my post below) I have noticed that I am not as hungry anymore and my temper is better.  However, I still cannot go back to sleep after one of the kids wakes me in the wee hours.I am exhausted by 8pm The vibration is still there along with being fuzzy.\\n\\nLike you I a lot of questions on the chemesrty of the brain and body.  If I find any answers I will let you know.  My Dr sure wouldn\\'t discuss it.\\n\\nI gained 20 lbs even now eating less I put on a pound or two.  I am going to try the \"gym\" with a friend and see if weights for toning and areobics for weight loss works.\\n\\nThis is what I understand.  The hypothalmus tells the pituitary to tell the thyroid to realease more hormone.  TRH-TSH-T4 then an amino acid converts the T4 to T3?  So there could be a breakdown in each step that is why it is important to test for TSH and free T4.  I have not come across any info on T3 conversion tests and the accuracy etc...T3 is still contravesial?\\n\\n<p>[This message has been edited by ser (edited 01-11-2001).]\\nHi Ser,\\nMy doc says T4 is made into T3 at the cellular level, which is why it cannot be measured, and few doctors will order the test for T3. The blood level tells nothing besides how much is already produced. Does not tell how much one actually needs, either.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t seem an enzyme would make the difference here. Do you have a source I could read that from? Thanks, TF\\nThank you for the info, ser.\\n\\nMy doc said that T4 has to be turned into T3 to be useable. The body does this only as needed, though.\\n\\nThe supplementation of pure T3 has a drug (pharmacological) effect, which at times is desireable, esp. in the case of stubborn depression that will not go away by T4 treatment alone. Some psychiatrists will prescribe T3 to produce a feeling of well-being.\\nHello all. This is my first time here. But in\\nreading your posts, I have the same trouble\\nbut have not delved into it as thick as you\\ngals have. (the t4-t3 issue) I have been on\\nsyntroid now for 6 or 7 years. Lately, having\\nissues with depression, the doc put me on\\nprozac. I am also in therapy at this time but\\ngetting the feeling that she thinks I have no\\nreason to be depressed since I took 6 week\\nloa from work. Work seems to make me depressed. I dream  about the fear of going  back soon. I had a bone spur removed in august and still am having problems with that. It is fustrating at best. I cannot move as fast as I use to which is the fustrating part. I am in pain or at lease \"uncomfortable\" most of the time. Even sleeping is hard to get to. But once I am sleep, it is a good 9-12 hours. I work in retail and am constantly on the go. I am required to work 45-50 hours per week and am thinking about stepping down from my current manager position to something a  little less stressful and physical. I have had a terrible  life the last 12 years and the doc thinks I am suffering from post trumatic stress syndrome. I just think I have a ******** for a boss who reminds me of my x. (ha  ha). Don\\'t know what else to say here. I have had my thyroid rad out. I fear I am loosing my mind somedays. Then I think I am just being silly. Any ideas?\\nPeggy- Try <A HREF=\"http://www.about.com\" TARGET=_blank>www.about.com</A>  go to the heath section and then thyroid.  There is a link there about T3 supplement also the book The Throid Solution is a good reference. Do you go to Mt Home or Twin Falls for medical services?  Boise here. As far as your Job, Can you find something else that you like?  Or tranfer stores?  Stress seems to be a trigger for me and I am in the process of deciding if I want to change what I do.

       " {'post': \"I decided to put this on its own thread, as the information may be useful to others.\\n\\nThanks so much, Karen. This is what I've learned so far. It seems to fit me, but I have also read that high T4 with high TSH can sometimes occur with other disorders (didn't say what they were though).\\n\\nTSH Secreting Pituitary Adenomas (tumors) are extremely rare, making up less than 1% of all pituitary tumors. They are sometimes called TSHoma's. Their molecular basis is unknown. Cause is unknown. They are slow-growing tumors, located on the pituitary gland. Because they are so rare, they are often overlooked for years as a possible cause for hyperthyroid symptoms. Over time, they can become large and inasive, but they are virtually always benign. These tumors secrete TSH in excess, therefore causing the thyroid to overproduce thyroid hormones. Patients will typically have an elevated T4 and markedly high TSH.\\n\\nSymptoms are very similar to that of HyperT/Graves, including palpitations, fast heartbeat, irregular menstrual cycles, headache, difficulty falling asleep, fatigue, weightloss, sweating, nervousness, frequent bowel movements, and sometimes visual disturbances. Also, HyperT/Graves and TSH-Secreting Tumors both generally cause T4 elevations. However, in HyperT/Graves, the TSH is immeasurably low, in contrast to TSH-Secreting Tumors in which the TSH is measurable or high.\\n\\nMRI or CT of the pituitary (without and with contrast agents) are the most common ways to diagnose, and will usually show the adenoma.\\n\\nTreatment is usually transsphanoidal surgical removal (where they go through the nasal cavity). Larger tumors may also require thyroid ablation along with pituitary radiation therapy. Some very large tumors may need to be removed through a more invasive surgical procedure where they have to go through the skull.\\n\\nWell thats about it. I do think it could fit with my labs and symptoms. I really think I need my pituitary scanned, with CT or MRI. If my last pending test (24 hr urine looking for adrenal probs) comes out ok, I'm gonna make another appt with my family doc and ask him to order one of these head scans. I'm not optimistic he will, because I don't have insurance, and already had a chest CT. If he won't cooperate, I'll find another doctor, then another, and another.....\\n\\nThanks so much for caring,\\nCherilyn\\nYou have the right attitude for getting somewhere with doctors.\\nDon't know if you know this, pardon me if you do...\\nImaging centers have one price that they bill insurance, and a cash price for those without insurance.

What are your exact symptoms if you don't mind............any you can think of.   You would be surprised how many you can have.\\n\\nGlad you found us here!\\nKaren\\nThe very worst symptom I have now is tachycardia, and sometimes chest pain. But looking back, for at least the last 6 months, I have had several symptoms that I didn't pay much attention to. I thought it was mostly normal aging (I'm 35). I am now trying to put it all together. To this day, I am still experiencing these symptoms. Here is a list of everything I can think of:\\n\\n-About 6 months ago, I thought my windpipe seemed huge (hard, not painful) but it is smaller now\\n-Weight Loss (should've gained, I ate everything and never exercised - I used to weigh 135-145, now 115)\\n-Muscle atrophy all over my body\\n-Dry, flaky, 'crinkly' skin (like an 80 year old's)\\n-Night sweats\\n-Headaches\\n-Tight throat\\n-Noticeable heartbeat\\n-Sporadic low grade fever, 99.0-99.5 (had this a month ago, is gone now, Dr. never found a cause)\\n-Heart flutters\\n-Weakness\\n-Intolerate to cold or heat (worse with cold, though)\\n-Trouble getting to sleep\\n-Hair falls out\\n-Fatigue, oversleeping\\n-Occasional energy bursts\\n-Nervous, irritable\\n-Occasional lower back pain\\n-Ringing ears\\n-Teeth hurt\\n-Menstrual spotting (even though I'm on 'the pill')\\n-Occasional chest pain\\n-Tachycardia\\n\\nAs for the chest pain and tachycardia..... About 3 months ago, the first thing I really paid attention to, was occasional chest pain in the evening. This escalated, and finally sent me to the ER. I was admitted overnight, had alot of ekg,s, some showed bradycardia, of all things (HB too slow). I had a stress test too. But the heart tests all came out fine.\\n\\nWithin days of the ER visit, I began to have constant tachycardia that has, more recently, escalated to the point that I literally could not move without my heart racing BAD and doing flip flops, skipping beats trying to keep up. Walking was impossble. I ended up under the care of a cardiologist, even wore a 24 hr monitor. The cardiologist says my tach is NOT related to any heart problems. He is stumped, would call me out of the blue, asking questions. He couldn't figure out a cause, and thought my thyroid test was ok. He put me on a beta blocker which slows the heart, but that is only treating the symptom, not the (unknown) cause. He has now turned me back over to my family doc, who I've decided I will see one more time, (and ask for a pituitary scan) before moving on.\\n\\nI don't want to be on a beta blocker if I don't have heart problems, but I can't function without them. The tachycardia is just too BAD. It's a total body feeling, like my whole body is in overdrive. I'm still feeling the symptoms listed above, too. I need answers, but I'm back to square one with the doctors.\\n\\nAll these symptoms, along with elevated T4 and TSH above 3, ....honestly, what does all this sound like to you? Pituitary? Something else? I welcome any of your thoughts or opinions!\\n\\nCherilyn\\nCherilyn,\\nIf you are still out there, I would like an update to see how you are and what is going on now? I have been searching for info regarding TSH secreting tumors, as I am being tested for this right now. My TSH is hig, 5.7. My T4 is high 15.8, my T3 is high at 227. I was diagnosed as hypo last year, but over the last three months, have been having difficulty with hyper symptoms that you have mentioned you were going thru. Your post was a bright light going on. How are you doing now?\\n\\nThanks so much,\\nLiz\",\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi everyone - I'm hoping someone can help.\\n\\nI had a TT in Jan. 2006 for suspicious nodules and large goiter. Luckily no cancer; dx with Hashi's. (Previous labs were always fine, just high antibodies, which led to the Hashi's diagnosis.) Have been on 125 mcg of Synthroid since. Surgery/recovery went very well but I still don't feel well overall -- continued weight gain, fatigue, intolerance to exercise, bad headaches and leg pain...and past few months started having hot flashes multiple times a day and trouble sleeping.\\n\\nLast fall TSH and free T4 tested high, so endo decided to send me for an MRI of the pituitary. Results showed two microadenomas (4 mm & 5 mm). A repeat MRI 6 months later confirmed the first MRI. I have read that having two adenomas in the pituitary is rare and I'm concerned.\\n\\nHas anyone here every dealt with both thyroid and pituitary problems? I'm wondering if my pituitary is what caused my thyroid problems. Or are the antibodies causing both my pituitary and thyroid problems??\\n\\nMy endo wants to do hormone tests next. She said I might just need to get on meds to shrink the tumors. I'm wondering if I should not waste my time with her and find a pituitary specialist. I'm VERY TIRED OF FEELING CRAPPY!! I'd appreciate any advice! (I posted my problem on the hormone board as well!) THANKS!\\nI have thyroid problems that are probably due to pituitary (normal TSH and high hormones) but probably not adenomas.  Some people have non functioning adenomas.  They're just there and do nothing.  That is why your endo wants to do the hormone testing.  She wants to find out whether or not they are producing hormones.  She should be checking the TSH alpha subunit and molar ratio along with all the other endocrine hormones to see if the alpha subunit or molar ratio is raised.  In TSHoma, which is the form of adenoma that affects the thyroid, it is.\\n\\nIf she's on top of this thing and is doing the testing, you may want to stick with her and give her a chance.  If you don't feel she can handle it then a pituitary specialist might be your best bet.\\n\\nBest of luck,\\nHelen\\nIf she wants to put you on meds to shrink them, then that must mean that they are prolactinomas.  Has she tested your prolactin levels??  If they're not elevated, then I would find a pit specialist.  From what I've read over the last year, you can not shrink the other kinds of pit tumors.  She needs to be checking your adrenal hormone(cortisol), your estrogen, FSH,LH, and your growth hormone.  All of those, along with your thyroid hormones, can be affected.  Sometimes all, or sometimes just one of them, or a combination.  A pit specialist or a very knowledgable endo would be best.\\nThanks for the responses. I don't know yet whether they are prolactinomas. I had bloodwork done this morning (checking all the hormones and more), so we'll see what turns up. Last fall, my prolactin level was 7.7, which was normal (ref. range 1.0-30.0). I have also read that prolactinomas are typically treatable with meds, others are not. I've decided to see what my endo recommends and then regardless, make an appt. for a second opinion with a pituitary specialist. I live in NE Pennsylvania, so I will probably have to travel to NYC to find one. Hate to go through all this again as I just went through multiple tests, specialists, surgery etc. with my thyroid. Now I feel like I'm back to square one. I'm a little discouraged at the moment.\",\n",

Did you have any symptoms before you were diagnosed?  Please let me know, I hope to that it is nothing major....  Good Luck!\\n\\nSpence\\nyes i didnt i had absolutely no period and a half a dozen negative pregnancy tests. high blood pressure i just blew it off as it had to be the birthcontrol (till got off of it for 9 mos.) weight gain that i didnt know where it was coming from AFTER i got off birthcontrol.and a few other . (i would recomend that if there are women out there still useing the patch DONT EVER USE IT! i only causes problems!) but i did read a little about this and the site said that there non cancerous witch is GREAT! lol\\nI too have recently been diagnosed with a pituitary adenoma, but a macro.  I am still in the process of testing, CAT scan a few weeks ago, the  MRI is next week.  There are several types of pituitary adenomas and you don't say what you have.  Do a lot of RESEARCH. Research pituitary adenoma and look for good websites, org's or gov's and some edu's. The more information you know when going to the Dr. the better off you are.  Here are some questions to answer for yourself.  Have you had a CAT, MRI contrast and non contrast and ALL the pituitary hormone tests?  Be sure and see a GOOD endocrinologist.  GET A SECOND OPINION! And, do you have someone helping you go through this to discuss and make decisions on treatment?  Parent or close friend?  Research ANY drug prescribed to know side effects, etc., including birth control medication.   Ultimately, you are in charge of your medical care and have the right to make decisions.  BE INFORMED.  Good luck.\\nalli know is its a putitary microadenoma i dont know anythign else. ive had a MRI and i have to see a neurosurgon on the 15th of may and i guess ill find out more ive been doing ALOT of reading on it . so i know more then i did a few days ago . what is the difference between the micro and the macro is it the size?\\nYes, it is the size.  Micro is under 1 cm and macro is over 1 cm.  It is suspected that mine is 2 cm and it will be verified by the MRI.  Usually, macros are removed by surgery and many micros are treated with medication and not surgery.  This is why it is very important to know what the results of ALL your pituitary hormone tests are and what kind of pituitary adenoma you have.  If someone at the Drs office has not explained all of this to you, ASK!  They should be explaining everything to you.  Again, have someone with you at all appointments and check out the good websites, gov, org, or edu's.\\nthey said mine was 3mm big but they told me it was micro. i believe she told me it was a prolactin (im not sure how to spell it lol) producing cyst but im not 100% sure.but ive been going to alot of sites to get alot of what i know about them now . i always havesomone with me at my doctors appointments ever since my problem has started i havent went to one alone .its just when it comes to the results of my tests i have to call for them wich i really dont like.do you get alot of symptoms from yours like weight gain headaches etc?\\nYes, yours is a micro.  3mm is small, mine would be = to 20mm, or 2 cm.  A prolactin is one of the most common and I think can be treated with medication.  I'm glad someone is with you for all this medical stuff.  It can be so technical.  Mine seems to be what they call a non functioning tumor, in other words it didn't change one of the obvious hormones.  These usually get larger because of that and they say I could have had this as long as 15 years!  I have had menopausal symptoms for the past 10 years and they can be similar to some of the tumor symptoms and were vague.  Prolactins seem to cause more symptons, therefore yours was noticed.  It did lower the LH hormone which is the one that stimulates ovulation.  Since I am much older and menopausal, have grown children, not trying to get pregnant, it was not noticed, since there was no reason to check that hormone.  I have had migraines for years and have not had a CAT scan for years so I asked for one just to check them out again.  Boy we were all surprised when they said I had this.  As for weight gain, I have slowly over the past years but again I am older and it hasn't been a lot.  This biggest thing I have felt the past 6 months or so is fatigue and sometimes just not good but couldn't pin point what.  I don'[t know how much we can post  about websites but pituitory.org is good.  Good luck!\\noh wow well i hope everything works out for you . i origionally thought i was pregnant but when i would take a pregnancy test it wouldnt show positive or negative so finally i went to the doctor because i was feeling sick . and my appitite increased  my clothes were fitting tigher ( i know it cant be the DRYER lol)just little signs here and there and no period for months so finally i went to the doctor and it was a shock to find out i wasnt pregnant yet i found this but i needed answers . its not as bad as it could be or as bad as it can be but what ever the size no one wants to find out they have anythign inside there head growing that they cant see lol Good luck to you to i hope every thing works out good for you!\\n\",\n",

Mine are:\\n\\nTSH  0.84  (0.3--5.6)\\nFree T4  0.9  (0.6--1.1)\\nTotal T4  9.5  (4.5--12.5)\\nTotal T3  107  (60--181)\\n\\nI have many hypo symptoms, an enlarged thyroid with complex cold nodule on one side (biopsy this week), an RAI uptake scan pointing to hypo (6-hr uptake was low; 24-hr uptake was low-normal), and a family history of hypothyroid and autoimmune disease. My doctor is confused as to why my lab results are coming back like this when all my symptoms and family history strongly indicate hypo. She just ordered a new round of tests, including TSH, free T4/T3, T3 Uptake, reverse T3, and TSI (for Grave\\'s antibodies--I have one cousin with Grave\\'s disease). I already had TPO-Ab and TgAb tests for Hashimoto\\'s antibodies, which show I am positive for both antibodies but in levels so low they\\'re considered normal.\\n\\nI\\'ve wondered about a pituitary problem, too, but now I am also wondering if some medications I take might be skewing my tests. Last night I found some info about dopamine agonists suppressing TSH and messing up thyroid test results. Very interesting to me because I take two meds, Wellbutrin and Adderall, which both affect dopamine.  Do you take any similar meds, by chance?\\n\\nKeep us posted on what you find out.\\nHi IrisT\\nwow our numbers ARE similar! we\\'re messed-up-thyroid-twins\\nthat would be great if we could keep each other updated and compare notes\\n\\nI am not on any medications...so no clues there\\nso, what info would they gather from the nodule? i\\'m still new to all this all these terms are making my head spin\\n\\nkeep me posted!\\n\\nbtw, it\\'s funny, i\\'m about 5 min. away from the border to michigan, in canada\\nmaybe we really are twins :P\\nHi messed-up-thyroid twin!\\n(Waving at you from across the border)\\n\\nThis week I should get T3 uptake and Free T3 results back...it will be interesting to see if those are close to yours, too.\\n\\nThe nodule I have is a complex cold nodule on the left lobe of my thyroid. \"Complex\" means it contains both solid material and fluid-filled cysts. \"Cold\" means it doesn\\'t take up (absorb) radioactive iodine. The way I understand the biopsy, the ENT uses a fine needle to remove samples of tissue from the nodule and the thyroid gland. I think he might also aspirate (drain liquid from) the cysts within the nodule; this may help to decrease the size of the nodule, making my enlarged thryoid smaller. The ENT will send those samples to a pathologist, who will view them to see what kind of tissue they contain and if there are any cancer cells present. Also, he can tell if I have Hashimoto\\'s disease.\\n\\nDon\\'t quote me on any of that explanation, but that\\'s how I think it works.\\n\\nDo you have an enlarged thyroid also?\\nHey to you both,\\nI just noticed my labs are similar too--Ive heard something similar to this about any SSRI med and Dopamine. I would be interested in learning more.  I take Lexapro and trazadone to sleep. I also read something about pituitary tumors causing secondary thyroid-related problems.  Do any of you have deteriorating vision, headaches or menstrual problems as well?\\n\\nBJM\\n\\nyup to headaches (tmj pain..not often but when it comes on LOOK OUT! the last time i had to *crawl* to the phone to call the inlaws to pick up the kids cuz i was UNABLE To feed them or do anything), my periods were gone for a year after i had the baby and when they came back they are about 2 weeks long now...\\n\\nas for vision, i just feel it slightly getting worse during the day, but definitely the past few months was telling dh that I cannot drive at night anymore cuz everything is sooo hard to read unless i\\'m right up to it and the lights etc are fuzzy\\n\\nhow about you?\\nI had a few headaches that were severe and went to the ER over the past few years.  I just figured they were migraines and really haven\\'t been too bothered with them anymore.  My periods only come every three months, but last about 10 days, because I\\'m over 40 they attribute it to menopause, yet I have slight leaking from my breasts and stopped breast feeding 16 years ago.  It seems contradictory to menopause!  Keep hanging in there..maybe if one of us finds out something more it can help the others...\\nBJM\\n\\nGenerally none of those problems for me. I always used to have severe PMS, a migraine headache the day or two before my period, plus very painful periods (heavy, cramps, etc.), but all of that went away two years ago when I cleaned up my diet. I eat protein at every meal, good fats, complex carbs only, veggies and fruit;  cut out sugar & artificial sweeteners, caffeine, processed foods and \"whites\"--white flour, white rice, etc.  The only time I have menstrual pain/headaches now is if I skimp on the healthy food and let sugar and caffeine slip back into my diet.\\n\\nMeisha, I\\'ve read the leaking breast problem might be connected to pituitary.

       " {'post': 'Does anyone know about pituitary tumors? I\\'ve had two MRI\\'s of my pituitary in the past six months and both indicate I have bilateral microadenomas (4 mm & 5 mm). I have read that having two is rare and each, if functioning, can release different hormones. Some background info: I had a thyroidectomy for a multinodular goiter in Jan. 2006 (had high antibodies, all other bloodwork was normal). In September blood work revealed high TSH and high Free T4, which prompted my doctor to order the MRI. I continue to have numerous physical complaints -- all problems I had before my thyroidectomy -- weight gain, fatigue, intolerance to exercise, bad headaches and leg pain. Now I am experiencing hot flashes multiple times a day and trouble sleeping. Has anyone else ever dealt with this? Endo wants to do hormone tests next.

I\\'m very concerned about this situation and I\\'m VERY TIRED OF FEELING CRAPPY!! I\\'d appreciate any advice!\\nI do not have this problem, but my advice to you is to see a specialist. No point is continuing to feel this bad, or putting off taking the meds to shrink them.\\nSorry to hear of you situation, but you are not alone.\\n\\nI have heard of many people having 2(or more) pit tumors. It really is not that uncommon. MRIs are not that accurate in size, location or even finding some tumors.. So, you can not put too much thought into the MRI. I have had 3 MRIs and they all say/show something different. It also has alot to do with the experience of the radiologist reading the films.Someone I know well had a prolactinoma and an acth secreting tumor. I have heard of lots who never had a tumor found or it was thought to be a single small tumor and when the surgeon got in there there was much more going on.\\n\\nMedication for shrinking the tumor would be if you had a prolactinoma. Are you lactating?\\n\\nAs far as if you should see a pit specialist...That is a personal decision. In my opinion, I  would get testing from my local doc quickly, and go from there. That way you have something to take with you on your first appointment with specialist. Make sure you get copies of your test results and check them thoroughly, because abnormal labs can easily be overlooked.\\n\\n\\nIf you are getting nowhere with your doc in a month or so, I would then move on  and not waste any more time or money...\\n\\nI would also suggest really searching around for the specialist you choose. Many say they are and you will still get the run around. Unfortunately, this has been my experience. If I had to do it all over again I would have gone to someone intelligent  long before I did. Maybe I could have saved some years in getting a diagnosis and treatment?\\n\\nIf I had to guess with your previous goiter and your thyroid levels now...you will probably need to see someone very experienced.\\n\\nGood luck you and I hope you get answers ASAP!\\nwhere do you live?\\nActually, an MRI is a very accurate diagnostic tool for diagnosing or following pituitary tumors and may be the only tool.  The only way a tumor would not be clearly defined is if it is extremely small or the patient cannot hold still enough for the exam.  I perform these exams all the time.  Most of the symptoms you are describing are the same exact ones that I have experienced with my hypothyroidism.  You should certainly have your hormones checked, especially your thyroid hormones to see if they are low.  If it were me, I would RUN to the specialist in the pituitary field or else you may be stuck in the same physical \"rut\" for years to come.\\n\\nKim\\nI was also diagnosed with two pituitary tumors.\\nBut the MRIs I had over the years missed the second one until I had a Dynamic MRI (where the dye is injected while the pictures are being taken) and there it was.\\nSurgery revealed that they were both different types. Prolactinoma and Cushing\\'s.\\nI hope CVDP that your doctor is running regular and comprehensive testing to see how your pituitary is functioning. That is a good way to monitor what is happening.\\nI agree that you need to see a pituitary specialist. I waited too long and now my body is wrecked.',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi everyone,\\n\\nI\\'m writing this post because of friend of mine told me 2 months ago that I have symptoms of a pituitary tumor. I haven\\'t seen my GP or had my hormones checked yet but I\\'m going to sometime this week providing I get a appointment.\\nI\\'m wondering what your symptoms were? I\\'ve been having strange things going on with me for 2 years now and I always put it down to the back end of a viral thing. But now I\\'m not so sure. Roughly this is what\\'s been happening to me; I used to have very regular periods & could set the clock to the time & date my period would start. But for a few years now they\\'ve been all over the place & more so this last year. For example I can miss my period for 2-4 months at a time, then I\\'ll have my period every 6 weeks & a few months ago I had 5 full & heavy periods in 6 weeks. I went to my GP in the end & she told me to come back in 3 months if its still happening. (Useless GP). I\\'ve just finished my period now & it was very very heavy but stopped completely after 48 hours. My last period which was 5 weeks ago was literally loads of bloodied clots for 5 days & then it stopped. With this period I\\'ve just finished I had abdominal period cramping for a week so I knew it was on its way but the problem is when. Argh I hate periods.\\n\\nI also keep having dizziness spells & visual disturbances like blurriness or fog in front of my eyes. I also get daily headaches which my GP said are Migraines but these headaches feel different to Migraine & there isn\\'t any Migraine aura. I feel the cold a lot too. My hands are always cold & when Im in a warm room I sometimes get hot flushes too even when other people in the room say I\\'m mad because its \"just right\" & not that hot. I also have nipple discharge which is exactly like milk. I\\'ve had this discharge for well over a year now, might even be closer to 2 years. I never told the GP because I don\\'t like to bother them or visit them & its definitely not a milk duct infection. There isn\\'t any pain, just this discharge which I notice every day I\\'m in the bath or shower. I also get very tired & the last month my sleeping patters have got haywire because I stay awake all night & fall asleep about 10am/2pm till I have to get up. So I\\'m always tired & lethargic.\\n\\nIm sorry this post is long but I thought I would ask about it. Thanks in advance.\\nI do not have a pituitary tumour myself though work in a setting where my job is related with the medical imaging of such cases.\\nYour symptoms are classical of a pituitary tumour.  . .all you need to confirm this is blood works- where you ll get high prolactin levels and an MRi.\\nThe tumour may be one of two types a macroadenoma or a microadenoma. The pituitary gland is the master gland of the body and controls most of your hrmones. That is why you are getting irreglar periods and secretions from your breast. It is also related to your thyroid which is why you feel tired. Your visual problems are due to the fact that the tumour may be pressing on your optic nerves.\\nThere is treatment and in certain cases also surgery however if i were you i would see to it as soon as possible.\\n\\nDon t know if i ve been of much help. You need diagnosis .. forget the GP go to an endocrinologist.\\n\\nKeep us posted Good luck\\n\\nAmy\\nHey Amy & thank you for your reply. Can a pituitary tumor sometimes cause memory problems to? Its just sometimes I forget things & names of objects. Its weird. I really hope I haven\\'t got a pituitary tumor. I know some stuff about this tumor but not a lot. Is it true that the lacating is due to proclatin?\\n\\nI have to see my GP to get a referral for the Endocrinologist. Hate GPs. They never listen just hand over painkillers. But there is one good GP who\\'s on tomorrow I can try to get a good appointment for. She deals with all the women issues so should get somewhere hopefully. Will I need to ask the GP specifically for the blood test to check proclatin or is that checked with the normal hormonal blood tests? Thank you again and yup you\\'ve been helpful hun.\\n\\nHi\\n\\nDon t know if this would result in memory problems. How old are you?\\nHowever the breast secretions are definitely the result of high prolactin levels. A hormone profile should include a prolactin test but there s no harm in asking the dr if this was included.\\n\\nI really hope that you don t have a pit tumour either. . . . however the signs are quite clear. A microadenoma is actually quite common and easier to manage than a macroadenoma. However at this stage the most imp thing is that you see to it.\\n\\nGood luck. Please keep me posted.\\n\\nAmy\\nHave you had your thyroid levels checked? If not, definately do. Alot of the symptoms you describe can be thyroid related.\\nGood Luck\\n\\nHi everyone & thank you for your replies. I\\'m 20 nearly 21 (2 months). I had my Thyroid checked around 3 months ago & that was normal thankfully. I tried to get a appointment today but all the appointments were gone in 10minutes. I\\'ll have to try to ring a few minutes earlier & try to get appointment but the receptionists are so annoying & tell everyone to ring at 8:30 for a appointment on the day & if I ring at 8am they tell me to ring back in half a hour & when I do appointments are all gone. Grrr. Oh well. I\\'ll keep trying till I get one.\\n\\nIs it possible to have high proclatin without a pit tumor? Can another hormone problems cause the milk discharge? Thank you again hun.\\n\\nSince you had your thyroid checked and that was ok i would say that it is the pituitary. . . ..i don t think that there is any other prob that could be related to yur symptoms.\\nyou are still very young it is imp that you have it controlled since if you don t it will be difficult to have kids too.\\nhope you manage to get that appt asap\\n\\nAmy\\nHi Amy. Thank you again for your reply. Still no luck with the appointment. It\\'s difficult to get a appointment with my GP ever since they changed the appointment system.  I was wondering, but is sharp pains in the head (occassionally) & dizzy spells related to the pituitary?\\nHi!\\n\\nI am new to this forum, but I just had surgery in February to remove a pituitary mass that turned out to be a cyst not a tumor. However, my symptoms included severe headaches for 2 months soon after the birth of my 3rd child. The headaches evolved into vision problems that included a veil-like  obstruction in both eyes. It was like I was wearing glasses with smudges that I could not wipe off.\\n\\nI went to an optomotrist, who recommended me to an opthamolgist. The field test at the opthamolgist did not mesh with what he saw in my eyes, so  he concluded there may be something putting pressure on the optic nerve. He had an MRI scheduled for me within 2 days. Very urgent, as he was concerned with the field test.\\n\\nIf this is affecting your vision, definitely have the MRI ASAP. 2 Hours after the MRI, my doctor called me with the results that it was a mass (tumor, he thought) and it was quite large. Labs done the following week indicated the mass could not be treated with medicine, because it was not hormone-producing and needed surgery. Prolactin levels were slightly elevated due to nursing.\\n\\nThis all started less than 3 months prior. The fact I had just delivered a baby was also masking any \"pituitary\" symptoms because I was nursing and had not had regular cycles due to the delivery & nursing.\\n\\nI found this forum researching pituitary issues. I am scheduled to meet with an Endocrinologist early next month. Cycle not resuming yet nearing 2 months post-surgery and still having regular headaches.\\n\\nBut definitely get to a doctor. Like I said, mine was discovered by an opthamologist.\\n\\nHope this helps.

I\\'m still not having any luck with getting a appointment. I\\'m not giving up though....try again tomorrow. *sigh*\\n\\nI too have vision problems. Like a fog going over my eyes or a lot of smoke in front of my eyes. My Opthamologist said I have Astigmatism but this shouldn\\'t cause this & to come back if I\\'m still having problems. My memory is very bad too. I\\'m even starting to slur my words. I\\'ve been doing this quite often for the last week & it always happens around early afternoon or evening time. Im very exhausted as well & I haven\\'t done anything apart from sleep so it doesn\\'t make sense. I think if I cant get a normal appointment tomorrow I\\'ll ask for a emergency appointment. Thanks again.\\n',\n",

I by chance do have hypothyroidism and take\\nlevothyroxine for it but it did little to reduce inattention.\\nAlmost hand in hand with hypothyroidism is sleep apnea.  It seems these are all linked together.  I have Hashimoto's and sleep apnea they tried to label me ADHD as a child and later ADD.. well it was other issues.  I could concentrate when the thyroid and sleep apnea were under control.  My son has sleep apnea (severe) at the age of 4 they were making the assumptions he was ADHD as well and trying to make us give him medications.  We got him evaluated and tested and were told.. something is going on, but he doesn't have ADHD.  It was all sleep apnea.  We got him diagnosed and treated his sleep apnea with a CPAP and all is well as long as he stays well.  We are having to do the chronic sinusitis/allergy war.  I am hoping he didn't inherit my AI from me like I did from my mom and her grandmother.\\n\\nHow old do you need to be to be checked for something like Hashimoto's and the like?  Is the age onset different for men than for women?  I would like to know so I can watch my son and treat something as soon as it becomes evident not after it becomes an extreme issue.\\n\\nBut many endocrine issue cause sleep issues.  Sleep issues result in sleep deprivation of one form or another.  Also the endocrine system is essential in managing the hormones responsible for growth and muscle and body repair etc.  When you are out of balance and not well rested, the resultant chronic fatigue stinks and is often tried to be treated as something else.  It has taken seven years to finally talk my MDs into doing the blood tests for AI's because my thyroid results have been off, but not to far off.  I so want to say I told you so.. but I would hate to make them annoyed with me.\\n\\nGood post going on here.\\nSincerely,\\nMG\",\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi,\\n\\nPosting here b/c it looks like there are a lot of threads about pituitary tumors.\\n\\nI was told I had a high IGF (insulin growth factor) level. Could this possibly indicate a pituitary tumor?\\n\\nOther symptoms I have are frequent headaches, fatigue, and irregular periods. Plus, also diagnosed with high dhea and testosterone (which was causing me a lot of facial hair issues!) I also have a lot of sinus/breathing problems, but i don't know if this is related to anything or not.\\n\\nI'm having a 3 hr GH suppression test on Wednesday...anyone ever have one of these, and if so, what conditions is this test used to diagnose or rule out?\\n\\n\\n\\nThat testing is for acromegaly. It is for too much growth hormone. I have the opposite in that I have low growth hormone. But I had the same test. It works for both. You are to be fasting, not to have exercised within 12 hours before the test and to be relaxed. It is not a bad test at all as you just have to wait as they take blood at timed intervals. They will,depending on the type of test, give you a med to stimulate growth hormone. So they take one or two baseline tests, give you the med, then at timed intervals, take more samples.\\nYour symptoms are consistent with a pituitary tumor. DHEA is produced in the adrenal but sometimes there is a cascade effect - for instance if the tumor is on an ACTH portion of the pituitary, it may not be sectreting that hormone but it may effect that part of the pituitary by putting pressure on it.\\nI don't think the sinus problems are related though. I had them and had a separate sinus surgery. The pituitary and sinuses are separated by bone and it would take a huge tumor to go through that and your eye sight would be effected first usually. An MRI would give you an indication of size. They are usually quite tiny. I had two - cushing's and prolactinoma.\\nGood luck on your testing.\\nThanks for the info\\n\\nI ran across acromegaly on the internet. The only thing that confuses me is that I keep reading that people with acromegaly will have large hands and feet...and I'm a very tiny person. My hands and feet are not huge by any means lol.  (We're talking a size 6 1/2 shoe here lol) I wonder if it's possible to have that w/o having the large hands/feet, or maybe if i do have that...they caught it in time before that happens? Like i say, i'm very small, so I would definitely notice if my hands and feet started to get bigger.\\nIf it is caught soon enough, yes, you would not look like those pictures. That is the goal - to be diagnosed before you get the physical hallmarks that even a 6 year old could diagnose a person!\\nIt should be able to be diagnosed on the more subtle symptoms so you don't have to get that far but if you are not, then you may be more at risk of developing some of those symptoms. I have met some with and without the physical hallmarks. One lady only had her teeth spaced a bit further apart. Her dentist noticed and that is how she got diagnosed.\\nThe pituitary is the mother of all hormones.\\n\\nIt is always checked when hormones are out of balance very much.  That can rule it out as a factor in the hormone problems.\\n\\nIf you do not have a tumor or cyst then the worry is gone.\\n\\nHigh DHEA & high testosterone in itself is not bad.  They give stamina, strength, good sex drive.  Many highly competive women have these hormone high.\\nI had a tumor.  I had severe sinus headaches.  thought it was allergies for years. (I dont have allergies now)  Yes it was huge. the surgion said it was one of the biggest he had ever seen and couldnt imagine why I wasn't showing more overt signs.\\nThanks for the info everyone. I'm still waiting to hear back from my doctor's office. Hopefully I will know something soon.\",\n",

       " {'post': \"I'm currently awaiting two more blood tests to come back from the lab before I see my Endocrinologist for the first time.  I was wondering, if one of the issues could be a problem with the pituitary gland would a normal head MRI detect a condition or is this a special MRI to detect Pituitary problems? The reason I ask is I have already had two head MRIs when they were trying to figure out why my balance has been so poor.\\nNot sure, but I have a pituatary adenoma and they are classified I am told as micro and macro...micro obviously being small and macro being bigger... mine was micro, 5mm I believe....so I doubt that if the MRI was not specifically looking for that that it would normally catch it. I was also told that often times the adenoma is on the inside if the pit gland so it is hard to see even with an MRI....\\n\\ngood luck\\nThanks Jinxy,  What were your first symptoms?  Was there any symptoms that were odd or did not fit the normal profile of low T?\\n\\nno, since my adenoma was prolactin secreting the first symptom that got my attention was ED, in retrospect my libido had been in decline for a couple years prior... My GP check T and Free T, among the std stuff, the endo was the one who check the prolactin...and after TRT did not cause the prolactin to drop he sent me for an MRI....that confirmed the adenoma and then I started meds to lower the prolactin; it went from 40 to 3.5... the endo claims that using the meds to suppress the prolactin will shrink the adenoma, BUT..if I stop the meds it will come back...SO, I need the meds for life or until a better solution is found.....\\n\\nThe MRI can be focused on the gland.  my first one was an mri conentrating in around the eyes (I was losing vision) It found the pit tumor (it was really big)  Every one I've ahd since then has been focused on the gland.  lots of blown up shots of the area.\\nIts possible the head MRI might show it if the doctor noticed it but to be sure you really need to have one done where they are looking specifically for an adenoma on the pituitary.  They will take pictures both with and without a contrasting agent.  Even with this test some adenomas are so small they can not see them.  It is best to find an ultafine MRI machine but I don't know how to find that.  There are different resolutions in the machines though.\\nHi HF, This has been a long road for me. The first symptom I had was this balance/dizzy thing, which lead to (or so I believe) brain fog, memory problems, very poor comprehension after reading, irritable, depression. I've seen ENTs, Neurologists and had many tests, but none have shown abnormal readings.  Because of my depression, which my family informed me was getting worse, I did allow the Neuro to put me on an anti-depressant which at least gets me through the day and helps with my concentration too. Is it possible all or some of these problems may be related to a Pituitary disorder?\\nThe pituitary is called the master gland and controls many of the hormones in our body.  Most of your symptoms could be from low testosterone which can be caused by a pituitary problem including an adenoma.  The balance/dizzy issue you had does not really fit that well.  Have you had any blows to the head or car accidents shortly before this happened?\\n\\nI don't see above if you have had your T level checked or not.  Might be worth checking it.  I can't tell you how many men have been on anti-depressant's when all along their problem was low T.  To make matters worse the anti-depressants will likely make your libido and ED problems worse if you really suffer from low T.\\n\\nIf you do get the T tested, also teat for LH, FSH at the same time and get  a copy of the results.  What many doctors consider normal is not normal.\\nI've had total T level tested it was 202.  They're checking 3 others, still waiting.\\nWell there it is.  The low T at least explains most of your symptoms.  202 is very low.  Post the others when you get them.  Hopefully they check T again at the same time.\\nNumbers are in here goes:\\n\\nTotal T= 287  was 202 month or so ago.\\nFree T= 11.8\\nLH= 3.3\\nTSH=1.91\\nFSH= 1.9\\n\\nThe nurse said that they read these numbers on new patients and determine what the urgency of the first visit will be.  I've got my first appointment 11-16.  What should I expect?\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hello. I\\'m 18 years old. I\\'ve felt terrible the past year. I just had blood work done and my doctor said that I had an underactive thyroid, or Hypothyroidism. He prescribed me to a synthetic thyroid hormone so hopefully everything will balance out.\\n\\nAnyways, after he said that was what it was, I of course went online and read about it to see what causes it and what I could do to feel better. One thing I read scared me so much. It said: \"The vast majority of cases of hypothyroidism (roughly 95% or more) are caused by a problem within the thyroid gland. A much smaller number of cases (roughly 5% or less) are caused by a problem in the brain or pituitary gland, a small gland located beneath the brain.\"\\n\\nWhen my mother was 18 years old she had a tumor on her pituitary gland and had to have the entire thing removed. Is there any way that I could have the tumor and this be causing this? I get TERRIBLE migranes which I know were a symptom for her. I was just wondering if pituitary gland tumors were hereditary. She felt terrible for a year and saw 6 doctors before being diagnosed. I am just hoping that it\\'s not what is wrong with me. I\\'d just like to know the chances of the tumor being hereditary, I don\\'t know much about that stuff.\\n\\nAlso, anything I can do to help feel better because of this thyroid problem? Any help would be great. I\\'m only 18 and I don\\'t want to feel this sick the rest of my life and let this hold me back.\\nIf you post your labs, with their ranges, we could get a better idea what\\'s going on with your thyroid.  From what I understand, hypo caused by a pituitary problem usually would cause a low TSH, along with low Free t4.  I suspect with your doctor telling you are hypo, you probably had a high TSH.  I\\'m not sure on the hereditary issue, but I don\\'t think, IN GENERAL, pituitary tumors are hereditary.  The only case might be the MEN I type---multiple endocrine neoplasia, type I.  This is hereditary and causes overproduction of hormones from these three glands:  parathyroid, pituitary, and pancreas.\\ntoni7289 Hi. Pituitary tumors are not usually hereditary, but of course any thing is possible. I would ask my doctor to be on the safe side. I had a pituitary tumor removed in 2000. I found out during that time, that pituitary tumors are very common. Even if you have one, some can be cured with meds and do not require surgery. I am hypothyroid now, but that is the only side effect of the tumor for me. Hope this helps.\\nThanks for your input, I appreciate it. When my mother had hers, of course it was 30 years ago, she had a terrible time. They couldn\\'t diagnose it, 5 doctors told her nothing was wrong but she knew her pain and knew something was. Once it was, she had to have surgery, was in a wheel chair after for a few months, and had of course the meds and then TERRIBLE problems with migranes after that until she passed away. A lot of days she couldn\\'t even leave her bed.\\n\\nAnyways, just a little worried, want to make sure nothing like that will happen to me!\\nYou\\'re welcome.\\nCT Scans and MRI\\'s have made such improvments in diagnostic medicene!\\n\\nSorry to hear about your mothers illness.\\n: (\\n\\nI hope you feel better soon.

The reason my neuro doesn\\'t think I have MS at this time is because my pc ordered a test on my pituitary gland.  They just keep saying my scan looks fine.  Is there a difference in the tests?  FYI, I\\'ve had every kind of blood test you can imagine.  I also had an EMG & NC- those came back fine as well.  Thank each of you so much.\\nHi, Shelly.  When you say \"test\", do you mean MRI?  If so, I can tell you from my own personal experience that a pitituary study will include certain pictures/angles but not all of the brain.  My first brain MRI was ordered as a pituitary study and although lesions WERE found, I had to go back in the tube for a full brain scan when it was determined I had MS and additional lesions were found.  I do know that a pituitary study is\\nthorough but the question is, will it contain enough information to\\nthe presence of lesions!  I suspect not but I can\\'t be absolutely sure.  Also, just because no lesions are present does not mean that MS is not a possibility.\\nThank you.  I didn\\'t think so.  I\\'d like to give a run down of what I have been going through & hopefully get some advice.\\n\\nEnd of August started have arm pain (both-dull ache).  Sept. 16 back started hurting as well.  Went to ER thinking heart attack.  3 days later legs started hurting (dull ache).  PC said it was anxiety & gave me lexapro & xanax. 1 week later I started getting pins & needles in patches all over my body.  Then burning from inside out.  My right arm & left leg were so weak.  PC then said I needed to see phyc if they continued. The only test he ordered was a CAT to see if I had a clot in my lung.  I changed PC & he order MRI to test pituitary & did loads of blood work.  I made app. with neuro & he just did the EMG & NC.  All test came back fine.  My sx improved w/o lexapro or xanax around Oct. 21.  They aren\\'t gone...but not near as bad.  I am having a problem with fatigue & concentration as well.  Anyway, am I nuts?  I really don\\'t think it is stress or depression.  Thanks ahead of time for any help.  I really appreciate it.\\nPS-\\nI also have heavy limbs (more at night when lying down), muscle spasms, twitching (people have noticed) & right eye pain.  Again thanks!\\nNot sure what an NC is...?  At any rate, it really doesn\\'t sound like you had any tests to try to determine MS, only things that help rule it out and I\\'m going to guess that those tests haven\\'t been thorough, either!  (MS is to a large extent determined by excluding other things though.) The things you\\'re experiencing could certainly be sx of MS but not MS alone.\\n\\nYou usually start with a full blood panel which should include Lyme (the blood should be sent to a GOOD lab, preferable IGeneX) and B12, etc. -- (you\\'d be amazed at how many doctors don\\'t test for B12 automatically).  For the MRI, brain is usually ordered first but some doctors do order a brain and c-spine simultaneously (lesions are most frequently found on the brain but can be found on the c-spine and t-spine as well).  Other tests include Evoked Potentials and an LP (spinal tap) -- for me, enough was found by doing the MRIs and well, I had an eye condition that CAN be caused by other things but is very closely associated with MS.\\n\\nHow long have you been experiencing pain in your right eye?  Can you describe it?\\nNC is a nerve conductive study.  They did test for B-12, lyme, thyroid, liver, kidney, hormones, & a bunch of other stuff as well. Neuro told me on last visit to call him if new sx appear or these get worse.  I guess I\\'ll just have to be patient & wait it out.  Thanks for all the help from all.\\nShelly, make sure you have copies of all your reports (and films).  I don\\'t know that you really have to wait -- up to you as to whether you want to ride it out or not.  With MS, it is possible for sx to come and go.  Also, you should give us more detail about your eye pain -- that\\'s how my diagnostic journey began.  MS wasn\\'t even on my radar!\\nMy right eye hurt behind the eye when my sx were really bad.  They still hurt at night sometimes & will wake me up.  My vision has decreased & it seems to be fuzy, but I thought that may have been to age or computer usage.  I\\'ve noticed that my eyes seem to \"jump\" or it feels like they do.  I can\\'t tell if the actual eye jumps.  I also loose my balance when I close my eyes (neuro seen that).\\nI\\'d\\nrecommend you going to see an ophthalmologist and if necessary, they will refer you to a neuro-ophthalmologist (or head straight to the neuro-ophthalmologist).  I\\'m actually really surprised that your doctors have not suggested this!  There are certain visual/eye impairments that can occur with MS and one condition which is closely associated is called Optic Neuritis.  Your pain and fuzziness could be other things but just FYI, these are two symptoms of ON.  As a very unscientific home test, hold up something red or bright orange and look at it one eye at a time.  Color impairment is another thing that is commonly experienced with a case of textbook ON although just because your color is okay, it doesn\\'t mean you don\\'t have it either.',\n",

I just saw this post.  I have had a pituitary tumor for a while now too.  If you can't get in to see a neuro-op soon I'd suggest you try to go to an endocrinologist.  I was on bromocriptine for years but the side effects were awful so when I started seeing the endo a couple months ago he prescribed Dostinex.  My prolactin levels have started to come down a bit too.  Have they checked your prolactin levels?  That simple blood test will also be able to tell you what's wrong.  Hope you get some answers soon.\\nthanks, just had blood tests with PC yesterday for a referral so we will see where that will take me.....will go back to see the neuro on 11/12.....he called to say that it is not a neurological problem, but maybe a cardiovascular problem.....maybe a patent formen ovale? any info on this one?\\nI think you just really need to see an endocrinologist.  But hopefully the results of the blood work will reveal something.\\nI have just joined this board and came across your page. I too was told that I had a pituitary tumor and my prolactin was five time over the norm and my serotonin 3 times.\\nI was sent for an immediate MRI only to find that the tumor wasn't there, I however am still suffering from it's symptoms including leaking breast fluid.\\nI have also had two mammograms and 2 scans on my breast as since the breast fluid 2 lumps were found, thankfully both were benign. Then a lump was found on my neck which was cut out and again benign. I am still suffering but I am now seeing a psychiatrist for psychosomatic ism as I don't fit into the doc's text books. Good luck and keep fighting the symptoms. xxx\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I\\'m a 21 year old female.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn February 2007 I began having a period every other week for months. My gynecologist blamed it on me being \"way too thin,\" however, I\\'ve always been thin and have been having regular cycles since the age of 10. Not to mention, since this has been going on, I have been gaining weight with a lot of belly bloating.\\nThe one week between my periods, I was PMSing.\\nThen I had 2 normal cycles, and then my periods ceased entirely (September 2nd was my last period, it is now December 3rd). I am\\npregnant.\\n\\nMy gynecologist skipped any and all medical investigation and told me to get on birth control. the birth control made me violently ill, so I moved on to an Endocrinologist, and my prolactin levels were elevated, but she said I took it too late in the morning. Well, it was morning for ME! But I guess it wasn\\'t early enough for her, so now I have to have my levels retested.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy other symptoms include dizziness, tachycardia (heart beating between 120-180 beats per minute), hot flashes, light sensitivity, horrible acne, all over my neck, ears, back, stomach, and arms....also on my face, but thank God it\\'s not as bad on my face as it is everywhere else ----I never had acne like this even through puberty!\\n\\nTHE ABSOLUTE WORST symptom I having is\\npanic attacks. I\\'ll wake up with horrific feelings of impending doom, I\\'ll shake violently and scratch at the walls for no reason at all. My poor mother holds my hand and there were times that I\\'ve squeezed it so hard that I hurt her during these attacks.\\n\\nI\\'ve always had anxiety issues but never fits of sheer panic such as these. I am now addicted to Xanax (1mg 2x per day) andit\\'s not even helping anymore. I have the attacks several times a day, unexpectedly for no reason at all. My Psych is switching me from Xanax to Valium since the Xanax obviously isn\\'t doing its job anymore.\\n\\n5 days ago the vertigo got so incredibly bad that I couldn\\'t move without falling down. I was taken by ambulance to the ER and the doctor there tested my vitals, all were normal except the tachycardia.....when he looked in my ears and asked me to follow a light with my eyes, he  said I had swelling/fluid in the ears and Labyrinthitis. He did no further investigation into the issue and diagnosed it as just that.\\nI was having hot flashes so bad on the way to the hospital that I got a fever of 99.5 and was sweating profusely despite the fact it was snowing outside.\\n\\nI\\'m following up with my regular doctor tomorrow about the ear issues but I honestly think I have something wrong with my hormones.\\n\\nI\\'m so depressed, I had to medically withdraw from college, quit my job, all my friends have been avoiding me, and I can\\'t leave the house.\\n\\nI would be so, so so grateful for ANY input, I am begging...anyone...please...\\n\\nhave your thyroid checked.  you could have hyperthyroidism. have the endo check tsh t3 and t4.\\n\\nif the doctor says to have a test in the morning that usually means 8 or 9 when people are usually up and going to work.  its very important to have them checked at that time even if you like to sleep late. The doc isn\\'t doing it to be mean to you.\\nThank you so much for a response.\\n\\nI\\'ve been having my thyroid monitored for a few years because it\\'s slightly enlarged (goiter) but all my bloodwork comes out normal for it. I even had to have an ultrasound done on it - normal.\\n\\nI know that it\\'s best to have the morning tests done in the early morning, probably earlier than I had it done (11 am)...  I just can not wait to be retested.  I usually faint when my blood is drawn, I guess that\\'s why I\\'ve been putting it off..... sigh\\n\\nwhy do you faint when blood is drawn? is it the sight of blood? dont look.\\nI don\\'t look. I dunno why I sometimes faint, they give me orange juice and crackers and then I\\'m ok.\\n\\nBear in mind I\\'m already dizzy 24/7 due to the Labyrinthitis (swelling/fluid of the inner ear).\\nI seem to be having a lot of the same problems as you... In the summer, my periods schedule changed completely. Ever since I first started getting it, I always had it every 28 days. Then all of a sudden I got it a week late... then a week and a half late... then two weeks late... then a month late... then just a week late this month.\\n\\nI also have anxiety worse than usual lately. I\\'ve been taking Ativan and Effexor for my anxiety since 2003, but it\\'s a lot worse lately. I also have acne on my face, it\\'s not too bad but I\\'ve never had such a bad problem before. I\\'ve also gained a lot of weight, mostly in my stomach area.. and then ended up having all of these horrible looking purple stretch marks on my stomach, but no where else on my body. My stomach also feels very bloated.\\n\\nI get migraines (I know you had a vertigo problem.. I never had that). But my migraines (As rare as they are) can be so bad that I just lay in the dark in my bed with a bucket next to me because I feel like I need to vomit. Any sound or light will make me vomit. I never had migraines until recently.\\n\\nI also get hot flashes a lot and have a sweating problem now (Again, these are all relatively new symptoms.. just from the past few months). I also get bouts of anger and mood swings for no reason at all sometimes, although I\\'ve learned to control them a bit.\\n\\nI finally went to an Endo and had my hormone levels checked, and sure enough they were all off the charts. I\\'m being tested for Cushing\\'s Syndrome.. the doctors are 99% sure I have it, but they are waiting on the results from my last blood test and the 24 hour urine test I did a few days ago to confirm it.\\n\\nI\\'ve had blood taken 5 times in the last month.. it really isn\\'t fun. I feel faint afterwards too a bit, usually very dizzy.. a little nauseous. But you want to find out what\\'s wrong with you, you must be diagnosed. The longer you wait to get diagnosed, the worse the problem can become. And the sooner you find out what it is, the sooner the doctors can treat you.\\n\\nSo make sure you get all the blood work done. It\\'s hard getting up early to do it, I know.. I sleep during the day and I\\'m up at night. I had to go in yesterday and today at 8AM to get my blood taken.. it\\'s tough, but I really want to find out what is wrong with me.\\n\\nMy heart rate used to always be around 68, but lately when I go to get it checked, it\\'s in the 100s which has never happened. I\\'ve also always had relatively low cholesterol, but I just found out from my last blood test that my LDL is 205 which is pretty bad... and it\\'s all most likely related to Cushing\\'s.\\n\\nSo you see, you must do your tests.. or else things will just keep getting worse for you.\\n\\nI hope you feel better soon and find some relief.\\n\\nBTW: One of the main symptoms of Cushing\\'s Syndrome is weight gain in the abdomen. Do you have any stretch marks there that have shown up recently, but don\\'t have them anywhere else?\\nThank you so much for sharing your story....it\\'s very similar to mine, though I\\'m having a hard time getting diagnosed...\\n\\nTo answer your question about the weight gain, please don\\'t laugh at me! But here\\'s the truth:\\n\\nOkay all my life I have tried SO, SO hard to gain weight. Even a pound or two would make my day, but I never went above 95lbs. One time when I tried to triple my caloric intake, I went up to 98lbs....woopy-doo...\\n\\nBut when this all started, I began to put on pounds without even trying. Most days I eat less than 1,000 calories plus I\\'m a vegetarian. And the weight accumulates in my abdomen. Whenever I see my doctors, they\\'re all so proud of me and happy for me that I\\'ve gained weight.\\nI try to tell them, \"but I\\'m NOT TRYING to....it just MYSTERIOUSLY happened!\" and it goes over their head. I gained 12lbs since this happened and let me tell you, it\\'s all in my belly. No stretch marks...but...very, verrrry odd for my body to put on more than 2lbs, especially without trying.\\n\\n\\nWith my periods, at first they were coming every other week. That\\'s when it all started (February). I was going insane considering in the 12 years I\\'ve been having regular periods, this was ridiculous. My doctors chalked it up to me being too thin. So when my body decided to mysteriously gain 12lbs in 2 months, they chalked it up to stress.\\n\\nThat\\'s when I decided to see an Endocrinologist. and my periods ceased altogether for no apparent reason.\\nMost women wouldn\\'t complain, but, it\\'d be relieving to start a period because all I do is is PMS!\\n\\nHaven\\'t had one since September 2nd, and I\\'m covered in acne.\\n\\nFortunately it\\'s not so much on my face as it is on my back and ears. (EARS?! ugh). I\\'ve been on Retin-A, Proactive, Benzoyl Peroxide, Clindamycin, Erthomycin, system antibiotics, Salicyclic OTC stuff, regular antibacterial stuff, herbal remedies....nothing helps this acne. Everyday I wake up to at least 5 new, big, painful ones that seem to come from the inside out.\\n\\nI talked to my endo about my sleeping habits. I\\'ve always worked midnight shifts and have went to bed at 6 am since I was 14 years old. I wake up at 2pm. So she\\'s decided to let me re-take the test whenever I wake up.\\n\\nI guess prolactin levels rise when you sleep - and if I\\'m awake all night and then take the test, the result will probably be abnormal. Sigh, I just don\\'t know what to do. I wish she\\'d give me the 24-hour urine test, to get an accurate reading of my cortisol... but as for right now, the only thing that\\'s elevated is my Prolactin...\\n\\n\\nI\\'m glad you\\'ve finally gotten to a diagnosis. When I was a teenager I had been stricken with ulcerative colitis - and the doctors told my parents that I was just anorexic for oh, about 5 years, until they did a colonoscopy and found that I had UC.\\nI\\'m scared to DEATH I\\'m going to have to go through all this BS again just to figure out what\\'s wrong with me.\\n\\nI am not sure if I have Cushing\\'s, cause I don\\'t get the headaches, but man, I get panic attacks. Major. I\\'m addicted to Xanax over it, and now my shrink is going to switch me to Valium cause the Xanax isn\\'t even working anymore.\\n\\nHow long did it take them to dx you? What made them suspect you had a hormonal imbalance? Was your prolactin elevated?',\n",

I am currently 38 years old and have never had a child.  He ran several tests on me, tested for the hormones to enable me to get pregnant, etc, and the tests came back that my body was producing them in low quantities and he advised me to try to get pregnant without fertility aids for a year.  Thing is, I don't have my period.  I could have it, and had it in years past when taking the appropriate hormones, but with the breast cancer scare from estrogen, I chose not to take it. It was rather surprising to me that he suggested I try to get pregnant on my own knowing that I do not have periods.  I do have discharge tho and sometimes feel like i'm going to have a period, but never do.\\n\\nOK that brings us up to current day.  Strangely enough, I met someone, and we've recently had sex (a little over a week ago).  It's been many years since I had sex.  I'm feeling very strange now.  I'm having a slightly thick brownish discharge (and lots of it).  My breasts hurt a little, and I'm cramping a little, and I feel like I am going to have a period.

I\"m 36 and stopped the bcp 3 years ago and haven\\'t had a period since.  I\\'ve tried Provera twice since then with no luck.  I\\'ve just taken it for the third time and am waiting to see if anything happens.\\n\\nDoctors have tested me for everything and determined that my pituitary has shut down. They recommend my gaining at least 10 lbs.  I\\'ve always eaten a healthy high fiber, low fat diet and exercise regularly only to have it backfire on me!  I\"m not underweight for my height and have never skipped a meal in my life so this is a bit frustrating.  I\"m having more of a hard time gaining the weight from a mental standpoint and even wonder if that\\'s really the problem.  I\\'m ready to start a family now and but this is quite an obstacle.\\n\\nMy husband and I have gathered information on IVF and may go that route but I\\'m not quite sure that that can help me given my particular problem.  Does anyone out there know of anyone who has experienced this?\\nHi -\\nLong ago when we were TTC, I read that it was a tad easier to become PG if you weigh at least 110lbs - no matter what height you are.  It actually worked for me 3 times with the extra aid of Clomid.\\n\\nWishing you well!  Barbara\\nThank you for the reply Barbara.  Well, I weigh around 114 for 5\\'4\" which seems pretty normal. We\\'ll be looking further into my/our fertility issues in mid-September.  Until then, I\\'ve started acupuncture, hoping that it\\'ll benefit me somehow and put things into balance.  I\\'m skeptical but willing to try.\\n\\nMaria\\nMaria,\\n\\nDid you go for acupuncture yet? How was it?\\n\\nI\\'m thinking of trying it....\\n\\nBridgette\\n\\n\\n\\nHi Bridgette,\\n\\nI\"ve been to acupuncture twice so far so it\\'s a little too soon to tell.  It\\'s most definitely a different way of looking at whatever the particular problem is.  The first time, she made an assessment of my situation, then had some suggestions for Omega 3 supplements and to go eat some red meat.  She said you need blood to get blood.  As for the needles, they are not painful.  I did briefly experience a strange pain in my neck, of all places, once I\\'d left her office.  No needles had been anywhere near my neck.  At the next visit, she said it could have been a chi blockage.  I definitely felt something different on my second visit, like a sensation of blood racing through my body.  This, after all, is exactly what I need!\\n\\nI\\'m still a little skeptical of the whole thing but will continue to visit for a few weeks or months.  Even my RE recommended I try it based on some studies he\\'s read.  I actually did some web research on my own and how it related to my problem.  That is what convinced me to give it a shot, months later, of course.  It keeps me kind of busy and focused until I see him again in mid-September to see if I\\'m a candidate for IVF.\\n\\nHope that helps answer your question.\\n',\n",

We  could start  one.   Sounds important, doesn\\'t it?   I did a web search and  only found that there can be an infection, or benign tumors, that most doctors haven\\'t studied it much, and that  patients can go home the same day, sometimes, after having surgery through the nose.

Since the hypothalamus controls some of the pituitary\\'s function, then the same thing also applies there.\\n\\nLupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis are autoimmune in nature rather than hormonal, so I doubt that they would be caused by a pituitary or hypothalamus disorder, but the symptoms could be aggravated by hormonal imbalances, though.  Diabetes, could conceivabley be aggravated, too.\\nThanks.\\n\\nSo  do you know of any treatments for whatever could be wrong?\\n',\n",

They go through the nose so no scaring.  you will lose your sense of smell for a while so food will have hardly any taste at all. Only thing I could taste was key lime yogurt.\\n\\nI spent 3 days in ICU and 1 day in a normal room. Normally it is only a couple of days in the ICU but due to the surgery the part of the pit that controls the kidneys got stuck on and I was basically peeing out every bit of fluid in my body.  Had to be put on a hormone pill temporarally to control that (jsut a couple of days). My blood sugar was also really high and they thought I was going to need insulin also but as I got better the levels dropped back to normal.\\n\\nPain wise.  Its only bad for the first 2 weeks.  Feels like being hit with a bat right betweent between teh eyes.  Felt like the worse headache I've ever had.  Couldnt' stand light. like daggers in my eyes. liked in the dark for that first couple of weeks (natural light wasn't as bad but florescent light or light from the tv ouch).\\n\\nWent off the pain pills at 3 weeks and started using Advil.

I'm sure most of my concern is just mental, building it up to be more than it is.\\nHi. It sounds as if you have a 'functionless pituitary tumour'. If so, the operation will probably be a transsphenoidal approach. Make sure you are treated at a specialised centre - one that does hundreds of these procedures per year. The procedure is very safe and patients are usually up and about just 24-hours after surgery. You will need follow-up by Endocrinologists to check your hormone levels and pituitary function.\\n\\nIf you have a prolactin-secreting tumour, there is a non-surgical treatment and you should be aware of this.\\nIt is a functionless tumor.  The doctor I have is a specialist in just pituitary gland tumors, and it's being done at a regular hospital, I believe.\\n\\n\\nIt sounds like you have fufilled my criteria. It will be nowhere near as bad as you think it will be.Trust me. I have 30-odd years in this business! You'll be OK, and those headaches / blurred visions will be a thing of the past!\",\n",

Something is hormonally wrong with me...excess facial hair, adult acne, I get red stripes on my back that go away after a few days.  I have read some about pituitary gland tumors, and I have several of the symptoms, but it sounds like one of the symptoms is obesity...and I am not obese.  Also, it seems to me that my forehead is growing...does anyone with a pituitary tumor have this symptom?  And is obesity always a symptom?  I would be interested in knowing what symptoms any of you with pituitary gland tumors have.  Thanks!\\nI would suggest seeing a Endocrinolgist. One who specializes in Pituitary Tumors. Perhaps a MRI of the brain. There are a lot of conditions that could cause your symptoms. A Endo should do bloodwork to check for different hormonal problems. If you\\'re face seems to be changing I would look into Acromegaly. Ask your doctor about it. You don\\'t have to be obese to have pituitary problems. Are you male of female.

I\\'d love to hear more from any of you!\\nI have a pituitary tumor and I\\'m not overweight.  They really aren\\'t sure right now what mine is secreting.  Possibly ACTH, which would mean Cushings Disease.  Symptoms include weight gain, irregular periods, hair growth, acne, stretch marks, a hump on the back of the neck, and a moon shaped face.  They suspect I haven\\'t had weight gain because I also have an adrenal gland problem.\\nIt won\\'t hurt to be tested.  Have them check prolactin, acth, cortisol (preferably 24 hour urine), tsh, and growth hormone.\\nAnother thing that can cause acne and hair growth is the adrenal problem I have, late onset congential adrenal hyperplasia.  They can start to check for this by testing your androgen levels.  The next step would be an acth stimulation test.\\nI hope that helps!',\n",

       " {'post': 'OK, here\\'s my story and question, it\\'s long so let me take a breath, and yes it does have to do with by pituitary gland.....\\n\\nI decided, immaturely, to get pregnant at 16\\nso stopped taking the pill. Well I didn\\'t have a period for 1 1/2 years, thank God. During this time I would have this really strange thing happen that none of my Dr\\'s could figure out. One of my pupils would get very large, dialated, while the other was normal. It would come and go, very strange. I would have severe migrains and nothing the Dr\\'s gave me seemed to work. Found that of everything the Dr\\'s gave me, buying Aleve at the store worked the best. Then I was in a car accident and began to bleed. About a month later I was pregnant. First beautiful daughter was born.\\n\\nGot on BC after the birth and was normal. Then, at 20, I decided it was time for another baby. Got off the pill and within a couple of \"normal\" months I was pregnant. Well it didn\\'t last long. I miscarried at 10 weeks\\nSo I tried again immediately and had on and off periods but got pregnant within 6 months of the miscarriage. Second beautiful daughter is born.\\n\\nAfter giving birth to my second daughter I got on the pill again. About a year later I was having extreme bleeding and such horrible cramps I left work crying. They changed my pill a couple of times with no success and discovered, through a hysteroscopy (camera through vagina into uterus) and laperoscpy (camera through cut in belly button to view outside of uterus) and several ultrasounds that I had fibroid tumors in my uterus. They preformed a D&C and since then I have not had any pain and my periods went back to \"normal\"\\n.\\n\\nAnd that leads us to where I am now. 27 and trying to get pregnant again. I stopped taking the pill a year ago and have only had one period. I have also been having the annoying dialation in my left eye again. Everything goes blurry and I look like a freak, my hair is shedding like a dog which is strange since now it seems to be growing on my upper lip, never had to wax that before\\n, I get terrrible migrains about once a week, I feel foggy and can\\'t remeber things which just reverses at night when I can\\'t sleep because I can\\'t stop thinking about things, I am very tired during the day, I have been very moody and emotional, I have gained 40 pounds in the past year, I am natious, feel like the room is spinning at times, and the other day I had a wet spot around my nipple. And again a negative home pregnancy test, what is wrong with me? I went to the eye Dr to get a new prescription, both of my eyes are usually the same RX but this time my left eye was worse. They dialated my eyes and did the eye exam again, this time my eyes were the same. Weird huh?\\n\\nI went to the doctors and they did alot of blood tests, again negative pregnancy, but the Dr said that there was something strange. One test showed that I was about to ovulate and another test showed that I was in post menopause, did I mention that I was only 27? Thyroid tests came back normal and now my Dr has ordered a CAT scan of my brain. He is pretty sure I have a tumor on my pituitary gland. That\\'s great, I just wanted to get pregnant, not have brain surgery.\\n\\nAnyway, thanks for letting me vent, does anyone here have a problem similar to mine or know anyone who has. I just don\\'t know what to expect. I am scared. Are these really symptoms of a pituitary tumor?\\n\\nFrom what I understand about that type of surgery (or at least last year when I was having a problem with my breast secreting blood, they said that it could be from my pituitary not functioning right) is usually done through your nose and no major brain operation...although that was only my experience and I didn\\'t have to had the surgery.  But I did find out everything I could on it and one of the cheerleading coaches at my daughters school actually had the surgery and had to have chemo and radiation because hers\\' was the cancerous type, not saying that yours is at all.\\n\\nGood luck and get a 2nd. opion as well.\\n\\nBec\\n\\nBec, thanks a ton, I really know nothing about all of this. To know that it is done through the nose makes me feel a little better about it all. I was so worried they would have to cut all my hair off and I would have a scar that would never grow hair. This is so scary and even more scary when you don\\'t know anything about it. Thanks\\nWell, I got my MRI done, thought it was going to be a CAT scan, but it wasn\\'t. A bit freaky, felt like someone was pounding on my head the whole time. Unfortunately now the waiting game begins. They could not tell me anything, have to wait until my appointment with the Dr who ordered the MRI which isn\\'t until the 23rd. I hate the not knowing\\n\\nchrisq on the addisons board has alot of knowledge on the pituitary gland. It is the master gland that effects ALOT  in your body. If you find you do have this you should go to the addisons board and talk to him. He is very nice and can help with most of your questions..The surgery by the way is through the nose. I actually found a site with video of the surgery itself. Looks fairly simple..good luck to you.',\n",

There is a great organisation in the uk called the pitutary foundation.\\nWhat she did tell me after been sent home from endocrinologist with no answers. is that this is extremly commen with pit problems- getting diagnosed is very hard as it is a rare disorder. She told me not to get discouraged and press for answers.\\n\\nnot that many **** i can recommend though.\\nI don\\'t want to scare you but i have started thinking that if its not a pit problem its probably something to do with the lymphatic sytem. Problems here are not really accounted for in blood results which is why why diagnosis may be such a problem.\\n\\nSorrell do you have any of the following?\\n1. Swollen lymph nodes that sre not painful?\\n2. rashes or histamine release around body/face\\n3 strange crusty spots/ rashes\\n4.skin peeling\\n5.breathing problems\\n6 feeling of body heaviness\\n7. Headaches\\n8. sleep problems wake feeling worse than when you weent to bed\\n9. thickening patches on skin\\n10 coarsening features\\n11. changes in smell of sweat\\n12 changes in bones\\nid be intersted to know which one of these you tick off and seee how much of our stuff matches.\\n\\nDon\\'t give up i had given up for ages letting the Docs tell me what they wanted i was too sick to care but the boards have encouraged me to get strong and angry and on top of this thing.\\n\\nzoe x\\nYeah actually I listed the UK pituitary foundation site on there.  I saw that thing on their site about the phone buddies.  That\\'s a  really good idea.\\n\\nI do have a lot of the stuff you listed, but not swollen lymph nodes or breathing problems.  I have pretty much everything else.\\n\\nI was told that the three categories of diseases that tend not to show up on standard blood tests, and are hardest to diagnose, are: endocrine, autoimmune, and cancer.\\n\\nSo what direction are you taking now as far as seeing new specialists or having more tests?  I am not sure what step I should take next, but maybe when my MRI results come back I\\'ll have a better idea.\\ntheres some more stuff you should kbow;\\nMy growth hormone was elevated but probably within normal range which is why i got no further testing.\\n\\nYes my vision has been going real blurry but not for a while now more it comes with headaches.\\n\\nthe sleep thing is a good indication of pit gh problem\\n\\ni know the hypothalamus is the part of brain that is on an axis with the pit. maybe there is a problem here?  i heard of a syndrome where spinal fluid leaking into that part of the brain can do something to the pit gland flatten it etc i think its called empty sellar syndrome\\n\\ni hope you get the answers you want from your scan.\\n\\nFrom talking to the pit foundation i learnt that gh hormone changes are relatively slow developing. one woman i spoke to had a huge tumor which she had relatively minor symptons from before it was found. my illness attacks me so agressively though. i notice changes over night. and lying down is always worse for me.\\nthen again there are secreting tumors and non secreting ones and size of tumor seems irrelevant to the pain experienced by individual suffers.\\nthats why im thinking of loooking in other areas such as lymphoma. I suppose i better get another endo opinion too though.\\n\\nFor the eyes get a visual field test done. My eyes would just go funny with the headaches and i would more notice when my vision cleared rather than when it was blurry sort of like a film had been over my eyes. but visual fields were in normal range\\n\\nZoe\\nhere is my action plan,\\n\\n1 Getting proper dermatological tests done - skin biopsy hopefully sinus xray etc\\n\\n2. comfronting my doc with a second opinion from an endo\\nalso serious talk with him about lymphoma.\\n\\n3.possibly trying to get to see an immunologist\\n\\n4. have a follow up with neuro not sure what she can do but might talk to her about it being worse lying down maybe she will have some ideas?\\n\\nDon\\'t stress about getting results of mri results prpare yourself for an answer either way and think of other possibilities too.\\n\\nPlease keep in contact cause i really want o know how its going for you. my best wishes are with you too.\\n\\nOh and 5. im drinking beer lots cause the meds they have given don\\'t work and it at least chills me out a bit- theres no reason why we can\\'t have some pleasure at this trying time\\n\\nil leave you a post on this board if i stumble acrosss any info for you\\n\\nzoe\\nOkay, your plan sounds good.  Here\\'s my plan.\\n1.  See a new endo, one who specializes in pituitary disease\\n2.  See an eye doctor, get the visual field test and see what\\'s up with my vision problems\\n3.  Get tested for Lyme disease (simple enough, it\\'s jus a blood test and I can just ask my GP for it)\\n4.  See a gastroenterologist first, and then see what he/she thinks about other specialists I should look into.\\n5.  See a nutritionist (this is not going to diagnose me but my eating habits are beyond screwed up at the moment, I barely eat at all)\\n6.  Hmm I don\\'t like beer but I\\'ll try this...I\\'ll practice yoga a lot.  Keeps my mind off this whole thing & maybe it\\'ll help preserve some of my rapidly diminishing muscle strength too.\\n\\nThanks so much for \"discussing\" this stuff with me zoe\\n\\nZoe, what tests have you had so far?\\nHi sorrell,\\n\\nI had a short synasthen test for underactive pit- wrong test\\n\\nGrowth hormone day curve\\n\\ninsulin tolerance test\\n\\n\\nAre the two tests to have along with pituatary mri\\n\\n\\nexcess growth hormone is known as acromagely\\n\\nYou can probably be pretty sure of it if you have the following\\n\\n\\n1. increase in width of bone in fingers/ increase in shoe width.\\n2. enlarged facial bones especially enlarged jaw forehead\\n3 thickening of skin\\n4 increase in sweat\\n5 problems sleeping\\n6 headaches\\n\\nIf you have all of these its pretty much a definate you have it i geuss. its such a unique disease. i have all of these. Its either this disease or Lyme.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am so so depressed today.\\n\\nLove Zoe x\\nI don\\'t think you can diagnose acromegaly on symptoms alone.  If your growth hormone or IGF-1 was high maybe you should have a glucose tolerance test (which is different from the insulin tolerance test.)  I don\\'t know, but Lyme would not make your shoe size increase or your jaw get bigger! And anyway, isn\\'t Lyme very rare in the UK?\\n\\nI am having a tough time too, it\\'s like my body\\'s going bezerk on me and no one knows what\\'s going on.  Just talked to my endo today and he\\'s ordering more tests.  He thinks it might be Cushing\\'s disease.\\nI have not had the tests yet for over active pit .

       " {'post': 'Hi everyone, I\\'m completely new to this thyroid stuff.  I\\'ve been dealing with some various health issues lately and my primary has been watching my thyroid functions lately.  She said they\\'ve always been \"a little off\", and I\\'m not quite sure what she means by that, but with the last test she called an endocronologist for a consult on my labs.  I wish I had the labs in front of me, or even what the values were that were tested, but I don\\'t.  My doctor told me that one number has been going down and another number should be going up when that number goes down, but both numbers are going down.  Her and the endocronologist think it has something to do with my pituitary gland.  Something about my pituitary gland not functioning properly and that\\'s affecting my thyroid?\\n\\nI\\'m sorry this post isn\\'t too clear\\nHas anyone had problems with their pituitary gland along with the thyroid?  I\\'ve done a little research and it looks like this would be called secondary hyperthyroidism since it\\'s the pituitary gland that\\'s not functioning properly.  Also in my research I\\'ve noticed that by far the main cause of pituitary not functioning is a tumor on the gland.  I\\'m just curious if anyone out there is familiar with all of this stuff.....I\\'m definitely not!!\\n\\nThanks, Lizzy\\nNormally, there is an inverse relation between TSH and Free T3 and Free T4.  When TSH goes up, it means you are not producing enough hormone, so your Free T3 and Free T4 scores will go down, normally.\\n\\nIts possible at the onset of Hashi\\'s typically to have wacky labs, as I do.  Your TSH is probably going up a little and your Free T\\'s might be going up as well in response to the hormone change and/or dysfunctioning thyroid.  I was that way for a while before my thyroid finally crapped out and my Free T\\'s started dropping.\\n\\nYou need to get tested for TSH, Free T3, Free T4, Thyroid Peroxidase Ab and Thyroglobin Ab to know if it is antibodies causing the discrepancies.\\n\\nAn endo will probably send you for a pituitary MRI (MRI of your brain) to rule out pituitary tumor depending on which way your labs are going.  The the hypothalamus controls the pituitary which controls the release of TSH.\\n\\nRead up on pituitary and thyroid disorders on the net.  There\\'s lot of info out there.  Hang tight though....don\\'t worry about anything yet until more tests are done.  Pituitary tumors are pretty common and very rarely are they cancerous, so I don\\'t want to scare you, if that\\'s what it even turns out to be....most likely its the onset of Hashi\\'s, in my opinion.\\nThanks so much for your response.  It was helpful.  My doc called yesterday and said she didn\\'t have the lab results in yet but I\\'m hoping that they come in soon.  I really hate waiting to hear about these things!  I normally don\\'t read too much into this stuff until there is something \"official\" to worry about but anything dealing with the thyroid worries me.  I\\'m a recovering anorexic (spent a total of just over a year in a treatment facility) and I\\'ve been doing good in my recovery.  I really would hate to deal with any disorder that will mess with my weight - gaining weight or losing weight.  I know everyone out there probably feels the same way though!\\n\\nAnyhow, I\\'m going to do a little more research just to educate myself on this stuff since I\\'m completely clueless at this point!\\n\\nLizzy\\nMaybe there is a predisposition to your anorexia and a potential problem with the pituitary and/or thyroid.  That would be an interesting case for the doctors.  I would also be curious to know if your lack of proper nutrients while anorexic did something to disturb your thyroid.  Iodine and selenium, along with some other key \"ingredients\" play a crucual role in thyroid health.  I wonder if you burned out your thyroid/pituitary somehow from the eating disorder.\\n\\nAlso, if it is your thyroid causing some trouble, please don\\'t get too worried about your weight.  Life is difficult enough without that extra worry.  Weight is very hard to control with a messed up thyroid.  I gained about 70 pounds in 3 years with a bogus thyroid, but have always been on the big side.  Don\\'t let the weight issue send you into a relapse.  Concentrate of getting healthy first, nutritionally stable second and then maintain a decent weight and above all, be happy with yourself.  Lack of key nutrients can really throw your body into a tailspin.\\nI wonder too hashi I have been boderline anorexic all of my life and lived also with a messed up thyroid. Now living with no thyroid. I have noticed a direct correlation between being hypo and or hyper (since I swing from one to the other) Both states make me feel anorexic. My TSH and all the rest have to be perfect in order for me to be able to eat. This is not as bad while hypo because I do not lose the weight I do when hyper. But in both cases I am not getting enough nutrients. Some one in the anorexia world should do a study.\\nWhen I first entered treatment they ran a ton of blood tests and one of my thyroid functions was off.  I think it was the TSH but I\\'m not sure, but I do remember it was low.  The rechecked it a few times throughout my stay and it eventually got back into the normal range, but from what I\\'m reading on these boards the \"normal\" range doesn\\'t necessarily mean everything is fine.\\n\\nI got out of treatment in late July of last year and since then I have been eating well and maintaining my weight.  But that is an interesting point you brought up - I wonder if I did burn out my thyroid from all the years of abuse my body went through.  Well I\\'m still waiting for the rest of my labwork to come back - I think the growth hormone test and 3rd generation t3 test?  I should find out on Monday or Tuesday.  Thanks for your input and advice - it\\'s been so helpful!\\nLizzy\\nAlso to note, thyroid disorders TOTALLY affect your mentality.  For lots of people, including me, I get horrible panic attacks.  Also, I was an alcoholic which my docs say was used to hide my symptoms of hashis and graves.  I know now these mental issues are attributed to thyroid.  Perhaps, your eating disorder was really prompted by the lack of proper hormones throwing off your ability to think as reasonably as you might normally have.  Im not saying that its certainly the case, but many people I know that suffer lots of mental problems, like panic attacks, are 100% cured after getting their thyroid adjusted the correct way.  Perhaps your eating disorder, or tendencies for the eating disorder will go away once you are regulated the right way.\\n\\nI had a friend who was anorexic and she was in really bad shape before getting help.  It nothing to mess with.  I know my friend was very difficult to talk to about it.  She thought she looked great and all our friends were hoping she would get help, which she did eventually and thankfully has done well since.  She almost died from it at its worst and was so thin we could see her bones and her skin changed to this very thin skin....it was pretty bad - its not funny at all but she looked like a duck that was plucked of its feathers almost.  Please don\\'t mess around with that.  Do whatever you need to do to get help if you relapse and stay healthy and eat well.\\nWell I got my latest labs back.   I don\\'t have all of them but here\\'s what I do have:\\n\\nTSH - .75   (range .35-5.5)\\nFree T4 - 1.08   (range .89-1.76)\\nT3 Free - 2.9    (range 2.4-4.2)\\n\\nInsulin Growth Factor - 219   (range 308-1138)\\nAM cortisol - 19.6   (range 6-23)\\n\\nMy primary told me that my TSH was out of range on the last test (it was low) and I guess it has been before, but on this particular test it was at the bottom of the range.  She had talked with an endo doc about my previous test results and he was the one who suggested testing the IGF and cortisol.  I guess my doctor\\'s still waiting for one more test to come back and then she\\'s going to call the endo back to discuss the latest results.\\n\\nCan someone help me with these?  Does the fact that my IGF is low suggest that there\\'s a problem with the pituitary gland?  Based on my last set of labs (which I don\\'t have) that\\'s what the endo was suggesting?  Any thoughts?  I\\'m so new to this - thank you!\\nLizzy\\nHi, I am new to this and hope this is where I post my question and concerns.  I have been diagnosed with a pituitary microadenoma.  I have vision problems that cause me to be dizzy and have imbalance.  My TSH, T3 and T4 levels are okay. My FSH is a 4.9 (good).  I am now going to get more blood drawn for other hormones to check if they are ok. I am wanting to know if anyone else has this same problem.',\n",

I was reading your post. You sound so simular to me. Well my story started in Jan of 04. On a Sunday mornign I could'nt walk. Within 2 weeks I gained 20 lbs,started getting really dizzy,severe headaches,rash on my arms and hand,ectreme fatigued. Well my family suggested becuase of such a strong history of MS in my family and because of the rash the I may have Lupus. so I went for a MRI and she called me later that night and told me that I have a mass on My Putuitary gland  and she reccomends that I see a Neurosergeon. So within a week I went to Pittsburgh and had all kinds of labs done and I had very low Growth hormone all of my other labs came back high normal range but to the doc it didnt matter . Now mind you for over 2 years I havent had a period. Well I continued to see him for a bout 3 months and he had me go so far as to get pre op testing and come down scheduling for surgery. I also had 3 visual field test done and I basically failed all of them. Well my husband and I went down for my apt and he tells me that he now dont think I need surgery to come see him in a year. So all of that time was wasted. Then I started going to Cleveland Clinic and got a second opion and was told that none of my symptoms are from this cyst. That I should see another endo which did. Well again all kinds of blood work and high normal lrange excepte growth hormone low and DHEAS extremly high. Well then I was diagnosed with PCOS and told to contiue to take birth control and put on metformin. Well come to another doc and find out its a macro and to come back in 6 months for another MRI to see if it has grown. WEll since then I have been diagnosed with Meniere's ( vertigo), bipolar,Pcos,insulin resistance excessive weight in mid section,hypoglycemic, and this pituitary cyst that I cant get any answers for . Now as far the hormones and the visual fields  and allof my sympotoms dont have anything to do with this,. All of the doctors I have seend contradict themselves because in their office the info there says about these symptoms and all of the research I have done on the internet all boils down to this .

It wasn't bad at all.  I was feeling SO SO terrible before hand that I actually felt better right away.  I had a very large tumor for a pituitary tumor and it was causing a great deal of pain.  We believe I have had it for about 4-5 years due to the symptoms I have been suffering but I just started getting headaches 5 months ago frm it and that is when the doctor ordered the MRI.  I got the diagnosis March 13th and had surgeryon the 30th so I am happy.\\n\\nHave you had a lot of side affects?  I am not sure if it is permanent but it seems like my eyes are slow to wakeup.  I also have terribleheartburn.\\n\\nDo you have to take any hormones?  My next stopis the endocrinologist.  they are thinking I will need to take hydrocortisone for the rest of my life.  I am not sure if they got it all yet because we haven't gotten the MRI back til next week.\\n\\nI hope your surgery gave you as much relief as mine did for me!! It has been less than a week and I feel GREAT!\\nI just saw your title as I was moving down to another Board.\\n\\nYears ago, I was mistakenly told I had a pituitary tumor.  However, I was told I had Cushing's Syndrome.\\n\\nWas this what you had, or did you simply (as if there is anything simple about it) have a pituitary tumor?\\n\\nAfter all of the symptoms, including severe and truly diagnosed Migraine Headaches, I finally was diagnosed with Lupus.\\n\\nI just thought I would offer this information.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nJon (Conductor)\",\n",

       " {'post': 'TREEFROGS QUOTE:\\n\\n\\nI read this post by Treefrog this morning, and so many of the things she has listed here hit home. I have tried for over 5 years now to tell my doctor what is wrong with me, and he chalks it up to my weight, or I\\'m suffering from depression.\\n\\nFor the last few years my health has seemed to fail me, the older I have gotten, the worse it has gotten.\\n\\nIt started in 1988, I was 18 years old, and in a horrible car accident. My left ear was completely cut off, I suffered through that, to end up with a scar and nerve damage on that side of my face...I have no feeling in my cheek or ear...and my collarbone was broken. I wieghed 145 pounds, I\\'m 5-8....\\n\\nAfter that wreck, I steadily continued to gain wieght, to the point that when I had my second child at 28, I weighed 331 pounds. I have battled my wieght since that moment, and I am down to 245, but its a never ending battle. Its cause for anger management at times, but I have pleaded to my doctors, that,\" I am to active, and I do not eat enough calories to constitute my wieght. And as active as I am, what calories I consume, I\\'d be sure to burn off.\" Result: \"Your just suffering from depression, you eat more than you realize...or it ..isn\\'t the amount you eat, its what your eating.\" Trust me, the weight is a major issue with me, I ballon up and down...\\n\\nIn August of 2003, I woke one morning, stretched, and apparently popped my arm out of socket. After the ER visit, which resulted in a diagnosis of \"Repetive motion\", considering I was a cosmotologist...it seemed logical to them. I told them, \"No\"...thats not what was wrong. But after spending 5 days on the couch literally doped up due to extreme pain, an MRI, some X-rays, and eventual therapy.. they still haven\\'t found a reason. Now, I suffer with joint pain, my fingers draw up, hand goes numb, my shoulder blade with even draw......but I was told, \"Well, if you keep having problems with it, we\\'ll look into it some more.\"... WHEN?\\n\\nIn Aug, first part of Sept 2004, I started suffering with chronic sinusitus. I have had occasional bouts with it, allergies...etc, but what started then was uncontrollable. I was seeing the doctor on an average of every 4-5 weeks. Diagnosed with the usual, double ear infection, sinusitus...might have strep or tonsulitus to go along with it, and it would turn into a major upper respritory infection before it was over with. From Sept 2004 to July of 2005, I suffered through 9 infections....all consisting of the same problems. Treated with anit-biotics and allergy medications.\\n\\nMy feet, they are a whole other issue...I have suffered with the occasional gout, to the point now...I have had extreme pain for the last two weeks, in the heel/ back of ankle tendon area. I can not stretch my foot out flat, it inflicts so much pain that its intolerable. I have hopped, limped, and jumped my way through the last two weeks....and haven\\'t visited the doctor, because...all they do is tell me, \"ITs your weight...here, have this for depression and this for your weight\"...\\n\\nI\\'m getting angry.......\\n\\nI have point blank told my doctor that I wanted my thyroid checked..a complete screen done. They come back and tell me its normal. I want my pituitary gland checked...but they just roll their eyes at me.\\n\\n\"They are the doctors, I am not.\"\\n\\nI have high cholorestal, high blood pressure, constant headaches, fatigue to the point of total exhaustion at times...suffer with joint pain...chronic sinusitus...wieght gain....bloatedness....easily bruised...low body temp...severe pms...unexplained aches/pains...no metabolism..and many others..\\n\\nOne note: I am a very active person, In my job now, cafe manager...I walk over 6 miles a day....toting something, bending, walking, running, I am not a couch potatoe. I am constantly moving...come home to work...even weekends, we are out in the woods walking roads..looking for arrowheads, sometimes we do 3 or 4 miles there. I do yard work..\\n\\nAnd my eating habits..yes, they aren\\'t the best. But like I said, I\\'m to active to constitute this body weight.\\n\\nI\\'m tired of not being listened too....I have begged, pleaded for help, and it all gets chalked up to my weight, or depression. No matter how hard I plead....\\n\\nWhats wrong with me?...I think it has more to do with my pituitary gland not excreting the adult growth hormone...but they won\\'t listen to me...and I fit every symptom to a T...\\n\\nGetting frustrated..........\\n\\nIf it wasn\\'t for the library, internet, and great places like here, I still probably would be feeling horrible.  Now that I am finally feeling so much better, I can\\'t believe I was living like that.  Never again!  I just knew that it wasn\\'t what the doctors would tell me . . . .kids, aging, stress, work, eating/sneaking too much, not exercising, not enough sleep. . . . .and so on.  My biggest thing is to TRUST YOU and how you feel.  Then keep pushing on.  And if it is your thyroid, it takes quite a while, no overnight miracles.  I wish you great luck in your search.  Keep us posted.\\nStuckInIllinios, Thank you for your reply...\\n\\n\\nFrom the screens I have had done, I couldn\\'t tell you what they resulted in.\\n\"Normal\", is all I have been told..to my utter dismay. I don\\'t want a thyroid problem, I just want an answer to whats going on inside/with my body.\\n\\nI did change doctors about two months ago, honestly, I was afraid of him, for the reason..I had previously used one doctor for over 10 years, and no results...I had been herded through like a pig to slaughter, never taking his time to talk to me, just reading the paper, asking what my problem was? To him giving me prescriptions for high blood pressure, allergies, and weight. Same ole same ole. The new doctor, did take his time...talked to me, but said..\"Lets handle one problem at a time.\"  \"OK\". He did the same thing...handed me medication for high blood pressure, high chlorestoral (sp?), and wieght management.\\n\\nThe medications did nothing but make me sick...tired, and more fatigued, to the point I didn\\'t think I could put one foot in front of the other..on some days. I know...the first thing I should have done was call him,but I got frustrated and slowly pulled myself off the meds...knowing that once I was off them, that I\\'d feel somewhat better. And I did....he was pulling my blood pressure to low. And I haven\\'t went back....\\n\\nI am so tired of doctors not wanting to listen to the patient...thinking that the wieght issues are the main culprit. I have even went as far to point out to my doctor that my mother suffers from Lupus...but again, no nothing.\\n\\nSure, my weight is cause for concern, but there are other issues that are cause for concern also, like..what caused the issue with the weight..?\\nWell, sad to say, it might take more than one doctor change.  As you may know, it\\'s very possible that your thyroid was damaged during that car accident.  Even simple whiplash from rear endings can damage the thyroid.  There are studies showing this.  Keep your oral history VERY CLEAR regarding onset of problems.\\n\\nYou can help yourself by getting your past test results, the lab printouts with actual numbers & reference ranges.  You have a legal right to obtain these results, just phone the office & ask for them to be sent to you. If you want to post the thyroid numbers & ref ranges here, people will be happy to comment.\\n\\nMost of us have had to be quite specific regarding which thyroid tests we want:\\nThe standard screening test is TSH, & if you ask for a \"complete screening,\" that is all you are likely to get. The majority of doctors use only this test as a guide, and it is highly flawed.\\n\\nSome of us have changed doctors enough times that we don\\'t waste office visits -- we prescreen the practices on the phone.  And network like crazy among friends, relatives, acquaintances, co-workers, to find a doc who is responsive.  You may want to try to find a doc who treats by symptoms, rather than by lab tests.  These are very rare.\\n\\nBasically you can turn the situation around somewhat with an attitude, yourself, that the doctors are \"hired help.\"  You consult them for what YOU want.  If they do the job, you retain them.  If they don\\'t -- fire them.  Who wants to pay all that $$$ to be abused/neglected ?????\\n\\nSome of us have found more success with docs who are not M.D.s -- naturopaths or D.O.s (doctor of osteopathy).  John C. Lowe is a doctor who has trained others to treat thyroid disorders that cause fibromyalgia (possibly you have symptoms) by looking at the patient, not the numbers.  I believe in his books he lists doctors who use this method.\\n\\nBest wishes.',\n",

       " {'post': 'I just saw my doctor and he referred me to a specialist but my appointment is in mid-october and meanwhile questions are swirling in my head. Hope you guys could maybe help me out.\\n\\nMy T4 is a bit on the low side but my TSH is a normal range. What could be the cause of this? My layman interpretation is that even though my thyroid is properly stimulated, it\\'s not producing enough thyroxine? Even though there\\'s not enough thyroxine, my feedback loop aren\\'t working that well and my TSH is still normal? I\\'m confused.\\n\\n\\nMy main question is that could stress and weight loss affect my thyroxine level? I\\'ve been under alot of stress. I was also slightly anorexia and ate very little and lost a bunch of weight a few months ago. I\\'ve since been eating more but I still exercise a lot. Could all this have affected my thyroxine level without it being a thryoid/pituitary condition? I\\'m still not getting my period and I have hairloss.\\n\\nAnorexia interrupts the feedback loop.  It causes the thyroid to get the message to slow down metabolism in an attempt to prevent starvation.  Once nutrition improves, it usually kicks back in.\\n\\nAlso - this is important for you to know - most doctors believe that any TSH within the too-broad lab range is \"normal\".  The fact is that any TSH much above 1.5-2.0 is suspect, even more so when T4 is low.  It\\'s also important to know your T3 level... The best T tests are the so-called \\'free\\' Ts, not the \\'total\\' versions.\\n\\nSince you\\'re new at this and just starting out, I advise you to always, always, always get a hard copy of lab reports.  Thyroid trouble is very much a condition open to interpretation, and some MDs are simply terrible at it.',\n",

So, anyways, I am also intersed in finding more info on the subject.\\n\\nTawny\\nI have a pituitary tumor.\\n\\nHave you had an MRI? I would think with high prolacin you would need to look into it.\\n\\nThere are a few different types of adenomas, and they all present different symptoms (although some seem to overlap and play the others down, very complicated).\\n\\nMy journey started over 3 yrs ago with what I though was just hypothyroid.\\nAt that time I had in range but low t3 and t4 and tsh always around 1.5.\\nI found a doc that listened and gave me meds and it helped ..a little..\\n\\nSo I started researching and they only thing that came back OBVIOUS was my growth hormone being low. Apparently that is one of the first signs of a pit tumor. ANyway, about 2 years into it I begged a doc (allergist mind you, I gave up on endos) to order an MRI. There it was. I thought that was the answer to my problems and I was very wrong...All the drs still said I was depressed, natural aging process, blah, blah\\nI haveeen to over 30 incompetent idiot drs,can you tell I am a little bitter?\\n\\n\\nMy cortisol and acth were always VERY close to low, but I only had those symptoms some times..This is why I get upset when people believe that having low cortisol in the am means that you are always insufficient. Many people with low am cortisol and acth actually have cushings and their rythmn is off. Mine are always low in the am and high in the pm. Opposite of what you are supposed to be. I really think you have to have a stimulation test to know the truth.\\n\\nMy prolactin is normal, testosterone is now getting high.\\n\\nAnyway, after much research and helpful info from  boards, I ended up going to LA to see a dr that actually knows what he is talking about. He started doing the right tests.\\nHe believes that I have cyclical cushings. I test alot and the results are starting to prove it. Meanwhile I have kidney stones, ostopenia, blood sugar issues, cholesterol is getting high... I could go on and on.Eventually, I will get the sucker out.\\nHopefully soon as things are getting worse...\\n\\nSorry, I went off on a tangent there.\\nBack to thyroid.\\nAfter starting meds my t3 and t4 rose to the upper level and tsh went pretty low. All of the endos I saw up until the real one were constantly on my case about the stupid tsh...I ending up lying and saying I was taking less.\\n\\nThen when I went to my Cali doc and he  looked and said well, your tsh definitely is supressed, like pituitary tsh\\'s are..Keep taking the meds as you are.\\n\\nI am realy pretty confused as to what to do now though. My last 2 labs (did not take meds for 24 hrs before) are showing that my t4 is going down  to the bottom of the range and my tsh is almost non detectable. Something seems to be changing. I don\\'t know if this has to do with my feeling worse lately or not. This @&%$ all starts to blend together and you can\\'t tell anything apart anymore.\\nIdeas Anyone ????\\n\\nWell I hope that I answered some of your questions????\\nI do not advise telling the drs that you think you have a pit tumor, they will tell you that you are nuts!

I know on other boards that people there have a harder time getting tested...It s bad enough here.\\n\\nI really hope that you do not have a pit tumor, the diagnosis is a tortorous hell.\\nBut, if you do, they are alot more common than people realize and you need to go go to someone who actually knows what they are talking about.(they all think they do).\\n\\nIf you want me to try to find drs in your area that have helped others, let me know where you are in the UK.\\n\\nSorry I could not help more.\\nGood Luck!\\nAnne\\nanne, do you have a fullness in the back of your throat up by your sinuses, and or find it hard to bring down mucous from your sinuses?  these are the only 2 symptoms i have that dont fit the hypo senario. it has gotten better with being on armour for the last week tho.\\nThankyou so much annemv , Thats seems to be whats going on with me as tmie is going on my level are droping, and I am getting to thr point of not living,\\nI saw my doctor yesterday and she said to go on prozac as she is realy worried about how low I am, And she said it will take about 3 months to see a endo,\\nIhate to  take tablets I am already on meds for my stomach and heartburn, also valium.\\nPlease if you can see if you can find a good doc in my area.\\nI live in south East ,Anglia England\\nThankyou so much for your help....Mandy\\nANNEMV,   Would you mind sharing who you are seeing in Ca?\\nI think I\\'m dealing with a pituitary problem also.

       " {'post': 'I Have Been Using Testosterone Replacement Gells ( Androgel And Testim) For Several Years And Testosterone At It\\'s Highest Levels Are Still At The Low End Of The Range It Should Be. I Recently Went To An Endocrinologist And Had An Mri Of My Pituitary Gland Which Showed No Tumor. He Said That In About 20% Of Men, This Happens, Resulting In Low Testosterone. I\\'m Confused, As He Say\\'s That It\\'s Not A Real Problem, But Anytime A Bodypart Stop\\'s Functioning, It Sounds Like A Problem To Me ( Especially When It\\'s Your Bodypart). Can Anything Be Done To Start Your Pituitary To Start \"working\" Again?\\nAlso, He Started Me On Androderm Patches, Which I\\'ve Never Used Before. Has Anyone Here Used Them, And Do They Work? How About Compared To The Testosterone Gels?\\nThanks For Any Advice Or Help,\\nRandy\\nI have used patches, & andro gel.  I now use a compounded testosterone gel.  It is much cheaper & it can be made at any strength need by the pharmacist.  It is cheaper to purchase than andro gel or testim.  About 1/4 the price.\\n\\nIf your testicles do not produce the testosterone then you need the gel or testosterone injections.\\n\\nSometimes the pituritary does not sent enough of LH & FSH for the testicles to work.  It this case injections of HCG of 250u to 500u 3 time a week can get them working & bring up the testosteron levels.\\n\\nThe testosterone gels or injections will stop any of your natural production of testosterone and sperm.  That is why you felt better after a couple of weeks using it then felt bad again.  It just replaced what you were producing.\\n\\nYou may need a strongel gel or injections.  Some guys convert much of the testosterne into estrogen.  This will cause fat gain & boobs to grow.  There are pills to block the estrogen conversion and other pills can cause to be eliminated by the body.  They will not shrink your boobs.  Fat can cause the testosteroine to be converted into estrogen.\\n\\nThe HCG will try to increase the testosterone & sperm.  The testosterone gels & injections will shrink your testicles & penis after many months of use.\\n\\nIf you never had your estrogen tested, get it done.  The estrogen E2 should be in the lower half of the \"normal\" range with the testosterone in the upper half of the \"normal\" range.\\n\\nMen & women both need testosterone & estrogen, it levels are just reversed.\\n\\nGood luck',\n",

A couple of weeks ago he and my son were play wrestling on the floor. My husband turned quickly and my son accidently elbowed him right were the scar is.

I am overwhelmed by the name of this disorder alone. Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis or HPA axis. I am, after two seperate tests (blood and saliva), found to be estrogen dominant. Not good for a 28 year-old guy. And I also am off the chart with cortisol and have to wait until the 15th of this month to go over all the other results. I am not fully sold on naturopathic medicine as I had a bad experience in the past as far as running up huge bills and being treated with rose hips and oregano.

I would love to get all of the $$ I spent on vitamins, etc. back. Not too mention they overlooked the problem too.\\n\\nIf you truly have high cortisol, that would explain the estrogen, etc. The hormone system is so complicated and they all play off eachother and you need someone who can figure it out. From my experience a naturopath  can not help high cortisol levels, and  you need to do much more testing to confirm them.\\nHigh cortisol is a big deal.\\n\\njust my 2 cents...\\nThank you,\\n\\nI need to get refered to an endo. and a good one at that.

If you have a hard time getting help there is a great dr in Portland at OHSU.\\nOHSU is one of the top pituitary clinics and i highly recommend it.  I have been there for a full work-up and they are great.\\n\\nYour estrogen will raise when you have high cortisol because it will bind to it in an effort to reduce it and bring things into balance.\\n\\nElevated cortisol is caused by 2 things......you\\'re taking some type of steroid.....topical cream, nasal spray, asthma medicine, etc.  The other is a hormone tumor that is made up of ACTH cells and is in effect acting as it\\'s own gland, making more cortisol than you need.  80% of the time it\\'s a tumor on your pitutiary gland, 25% is adrenal.\\n\\nThese tumors are not cancerous, they\\'re basically \"rouge\" hormone cells that are clumped together and cranking out more hormones.....kind of like an extra gland.\\n\\nExcess cortisol is called Cushings.  Do some \"googling\" to read more about it as you might see you have some of the symptoms.\\n\\nIf you need a good \"overall\" hormone evaluation I HIGHLY recommend Dr Ted Friedman in LA.  He\\'s the best......his whole expertise is to be a diagnostician for endo problems.....he works full time as a reasearcher and professor and sees patients on Wednesday evenings.

       " {'post': \"Has anyone heard of allergens causing Crohns/Colitis type symptoms, where if you remove the allergen(s) the symptoms dissipate or completely go away?\\nI'm wondering because I first starting having some perianal problems in Dec.\\n'05 while housesitting for a friend who has a dog. Then in March '06 - while recovering from a fissure cauterization procedure - we welcomed two young rottweilers into our family. They shed a lot, especially in the warmer months, and we constantly have to vacuum up the hair. Anyway, I have had more fissures and also fistulae since then.\\n\\nI know this might seem outlandish to wonder if there's any connection, but I really have few, if any, other symptoms of Crohns/Colitis except the perianal issues and some mild proctitis. As a matter of fact, I would say that aside from those issues, I have been as healthy as I can ever recall being since my teens. Also, this is the first time in my life when I've lived in a house where dogs are.\\nHi...I would think that any autoimmune disease that one has would/could be exacerbated by allergies if it puts enough distress on the body.\\n\\nHave you tried taking any antihistamines or even using a type of antileukotrine such as Singulair?\\n\\nWhat meds are you taking for Crohn's Colitis?  Are you using any rectal meds such as a retention enema?  That should help with the inflammation.\\n\\nHave you considered Remicade or any of the immunosuppressant meds?\\n\\nI would also think the stress of having and training a dog of any kind would be stressful..let alone two.\\n\\nquincy\\n\\nRight now I take Pentasa, which really is not doing much for me because my problem is on the outside. I am also taking cipro and flagyl because they have worked well in the past when the fissures/fistulae get irritated.\\n\\nMy doctor wants to prescribe Remicade but I am leery of it, what with all the potential side effects. Also, I don't see him until mid-August and I am quitting my job in September, so I am afraid to go for only one Remicade infusion, since a lot of people who only got one said they had a return of symptoms - sometimes worse - within a year. My problem is that I don't know if I can get it paid for under COBRA.\\n\\nI am thinking of calling the doc and telling him I want an infusion right away, so that I can get a follow-up infusion before Aug. 30. I don't want it at all, but the idea of suffering with this much longer is not a good thought, and I have heard of people having really good (and fast) results with 2 or more Remicade infusions.\\nI hope it works for you and gets you feeling better soon.\\n\\nI have a friend with fistulising Crohn's....when she flares, she does have to have Remicade.

       " {'post': 'Hey guys,\\n\\nI have been diagnosed with a very mild symptomatic crohns IBS two years ago, colonoscopy done in india. I thought stress and bad food and sleep habits at an age of 23 will do nothing to my health. Well I was wrong and it was late.\\n\\nThe first year 2004 was persistent diarrhea (It was not loose stool but always unformed stoool) and then normal stool. I also realized I was lactose intolerant for few months (had to avoid only milk) and then I became normal again. Never had cramps and never blood in my stool. I thought that will be my last time I will see those mild symptoms again\\n\\n\\nI again had another dose of bad diarrhea (intiated by stress and sleep) in 2005 and I thought I should end it now. This time I tried a US medicine called sulfasalazine on my campus health center suggestion and things went even worse. I had black stools for the whole week I was taking sulfasalazine. Tests showed no blood????\\n\\nOn stopping sulfasalazine my colon kinda showed IBS symptoms coping from the diarrhea... From the end of 2005 after the sulfasalazine bout new cramps and pain started around the upper quadrant of abdomen below my ribs.. still dont know if it is my liver (sulfasalazine may affect ur liver or kidneys) or intestine (transverse colon) thats causing the pain. Again I became more lactose intolerant this time I even had to avoid yoghurt and buttermilk. Looks like lactose intolerance comes up when you are in a really bad phase of diarrhae with me and again your colon kinda tunes up again in a month or so. But even after a month of stopping the medication and leaving it to reside itself with enough sleep (more than 6 hour) and better food (fruits and bland food) I found that I was coming back to normal. But a large change was that my stool size was now smaller and thinner than it used to be. Whenever I had a normal stool now, its yellow in color and thinner kind of flat surfaced with some part unformed. This has been continouing for the past few months with little pain again in the upper quadrant below the ribs. I am trying another colonoscopy as the blood and stool tests came negative, to remove colon cancer and polyps out of my guess.\\n\\nEveryone believes that I am thinking too much about the problem or that I had no problem and that I was an active badminton player playing at a high level made things even worse for me. I had to quit playing to avoid stress, sleep more work less and things arent getting any better.\\n\\nI still have thin yellow stool after more than a month something that never happend before the sulfasalazine dosage bout. I only had normal thicker brown stool that took the shape of my colon or recurrent diarrhea (more of an unformed stool) something similar to IBS. I am still looking for someones suggestion if colonoscopy is ok and if the pain resembles to any known problem. Any suggestion comment would be of great help to me.\\n\\n\\nRegards\\nKrishna\\n\\nhi,\\n\\nI had many a problem that were not concerned to a specific group, so instead I posted a bigger message rather than breaking down on specifics.\\n\\nI should have actually posted differently in different groups though.\\n\\nRegards\\nKrishna',\n",

One is stress related and the other is food combinations esp acid related. I will give you 2 examples. I found out my unlce died 2 weeks ago 9 am in the morning, I had eaten breakfast about 20 min before the news, within 10 minutes of this news I had diaherra, this is stress induced, mostly its bad stress not just annoying everyday things. 2nd example is I cannot eat to many acid related drinks or food in the SAME day that is the key. If I have coffee at breakfast, hot sauce with wings for lunch and a alocholic drink at dinner by bedtime I will have diaherra. Does this mean I always follow what I know, of course not, I have to get use to this and I have had it for 6 years. I sometimes forget. This came about when I turned 30. I have researched all the other bowel disorders and this fits best for that I think I have. I am planning on a colonscopy this summer.\\nHello LadyT-\\nThank you so much for responding to my thread.

Good luck\\nI get diarrhea (sometimes bloody sometimes not), low abdominal pains near right hip, back aches, nausea and vomiting, anemia, white things that form on my tonsils (apparently this is due to the intestines not working properly, one way i can tell a flare up is coming), i sometimes run a low grade fever-normal temp is 97.3 and a \"fever\" with a flare up is like 98. I have no appetite, and will become very gassy. I do get \"phantom kicks\", most women associate it with feeling like they are pregnant and the baby kicking i get this but it must be due to gas/air moving around causing it to do that way.\\n\\nI was originaly diagnosed with Crohns in 1999, then in 2007 I was told it was Ulcerative Colitis.

(I go to the washroom 4-5 times in the night..) also if that doesnt make it worse.. half way through eating my stomach starts acting up and i have to go the washroom again..\\n\\nI been going to the doctor back and forth. I went to both the walk in clinic and than also my family doctor but i feel like they dont take me seriously. clinic doctor kept telling me its probably IBS and after going back and forth to her about the pain she wrote me up for barium enema. just trying to get the appt for it was a hassle  took me a month to get the appointment. now during the process of waiting for the barium enema.. my family doctor decided to prescribe me some flagyl. now the antibiotic did help settle the pain down quite a lot but i still find myself going to the washroom consistently. it is extremely exhausting... i have both constipation at times.. or diarrhea........ i think i had \"normal\" stool just 3 or 4 times out of the 100 of times i went to the washroom.\\n\\nlong story short.... i went for my barium enema a week and a half ago.. and they said that they found \"multiple ephous ulcers in my colon suspicious for inflammatory bowel decease and suggested that i go for a colonoscopy\\nI am supposed to meet with my specialist in about 2.5 weeks and from there i guess ill find out when i get to go for the colonoscopy. but anyways it just really getting to me because I do not understand what to do to control it. I literally cannot go anywhere..  i will be driving and ill start to hv bowel movements..... i dont know what to eat what not to eat.. what medicine to take so it does not make anything worse. its coming to a point where i just wish i could attach the toilet to my butt and just walk around with it lol. but even my bumhole is starting to hurt because of all the washroom trips and im starting to get rashes down there also.and also.......i dont have ANY blood in my stools..but i surely have mucus..\\n\\ncan someone please help me...........give me some suggestions as to what to do in the mean time till my colonoscopy.... i find myself just moody at home at all time now because i feel like all i do is go to the washroom day and night. also i seem to be getting quite a few cold sores/ulcers in my mouth for the past  month too .. i dono maybe its related....\\n\\nHi there. What you\\'ve described is something I went through for a long time before I was finally diagnosed. It sounds like you have Crohn\\'s disease and possibly uc. There are various treatments your doctor can perscribe, but first you have to have the colonoscopy. Yogurt has natural probiotics, which help digestion, but go for non-fat or non-dairy, because dairy can irritate your condition. Do not eat raw vegetables, raw fruits, (except for peeled apple) fatty meats, cheeses, limit oils. Don\\'t eat whole wheats and heavy fibers, because they make you GO more. Try soups, white breads, margarine, non-dairy products and especially caffeine free. coffee is a laxative. avoid spices and preservatives. Hope this helps and good luck.',\n",

Sounds like you found one of yours.\\nFood doesn\\'t cause a UC flare and from what you describe isn\\'t a trigger, but some foods have action in the digestive tract regardless and can increase activity.\\n\\nOrange poo only makes sense since sweet potato is orange.  It\\'s high in fibre and water...so if your bm was looser/softer, it would be from the sweet potato.\\n\\nHow much did you eat?  Did you have anything else with it?\\n\\nIf you are flaring and have inflammation continuing to higher in the rectum and above, bms will come out faster.  The less time in the colon, the less time having water absorbed and the colour changed somewhat darker and browner.\\n\\nAll sounds normal to me for possibly anyone, not just a UCer.\\n\\nq\\nBy \"trigger\" foods I don\\'t mean an actual increase in disease I mean an increase in symptoms. Some foods disagree with different people more so than others. http://www.*****.com/ibd-crohns-disease/crohns-disease/creating-a-crohns-disease-diet-plan is a link that explains it in more detail from Web MD. One of the first things I was taught to do with my UC Dx ( even though it was a mis DX) was find the foods that made me feel worse and avoid them. For some people its milk (Lactose intolerance) others its wheat (celiacs) others its high fiber (low residue diet plan for most people in an active flare up is due to this) Creating a food diary that shows what foods have a negative effect on your GI tract will help you avoid symptoms. Does it effect the actual process of either disease? No, but it will help you live more comfortably.\\n\\nThe biggest issue is that every person with IBD has different \"trigger\" foods. It also depends on what phase your disease is in what will trigger more loose bloody stools. Learning how your body reacts to what foods will help you manage your disease symptoms.\\nFunny thing, it has not happened since.

Around the same time I started feeling down, tired if you will. The sores went away but the feeling of exhaustion did not.\\nA month later the sores came back but worse. I was incorrectly diagnosed by a dr. for herpes. This alone was a hard diagnosis which left me upset only to find out it was false. At this point my exhaustion was severe. I slept all the time, didn\\'t wanna get out of bed, and couldn\\'t do things that used to make me happy.

I figured it was like mono or something but it wasn\\'t.\\nOn top of this was my bowel movements. I guess since they have been like this for so long (maybe like 5 months?) they were not something i mentioned to doctors when i went in. But basically I had diarrhea a lot. Some days I wouldn\\'t have a bowel movement and would get so bloated it would hurt. then the next I would go like 8 times at least. Also i started to notice that my stool was white... and i referred to them to my parents as \"mummified\". weird description i know. but basically, it is mucus I think.

He has been on several different medications, and nothing has worked.  He is in severe pain every time he eats and is constantly going to the bathroom.  Does anyone know of a medication that has worked?  His doctor just keeps trying something new every time we go to see him, and nothing is working.  My husband is miserable and losing more and more weight everyday.  Any help would greatly be apprecaited.\\nHi..what medications exactly is your husband on?\\n\\nWhere exactly ishis UC located...throughout or limited?\\n\\nq\\nHe is currently on Apriso ER .375 gram (4 per day) and Hyoscyamine (PRN).  He was first put on Asacol which did not work for him.  And now the apriso and hyoscyamine are not really working either.  I am not 100% if his colitis is throughout or not.  I will have to ask him.  But it is clearly not under control.  He is not bleeding as much as he was back in November but there is still blood present in every stool he passes.  He is going back to the doctor today to try and figure out what they can do.\\nI urge you to get your husband to ask for rectal retention enemas.  Rowasa would be what\\'s in the US.\\n\\nConsider that UC starts at the rectum.  Apriso won\\'t treat that area.\\n\\nThat\\'s probably why the asacol didn\\'t work.  Both ends approach is the way it should be treated...\\nq\\nI have read that a probiotic significantly helps UC--- VSL3--\\n\\nIt is a very strong probiotic supplement.\\n\\nYou can investigate it\\'s research tests results that have been done online.\\n\\nI wish your husband well---Harry\\nHi there, I am a 29yr old female with the same problem as your husband, also with a concerned partner. I have a medical background so have researched for hours on end. I have started to find slight diet changes helpful and have been put on salafalk by my GI. Along with this I have been doing extensive research and experimentation of herbs and supplements. My diagnosis is moderate acute UC.\\n\\nI take mimtec - an IBS peppermint slow release, peppermint is anti-spasmotic for the digestion tract, my partner and I also drink this at night. I also recommend \"slippery elm and glutomine\" both protect the digestive tract. I think that talking with people in health food shops has helped and also pharmacists to find a balance. I take Omega 3\\'s, psyllium husk, iron tabs, Vitamin B, C & D and a probiotic on a daily basis. I also start the day with a wheatgrass shot, wheatgrass has been proven to help with anti-inflammatory, fatigue and GI issues, not to mention fighting cancer which is a high risk in the bowel for UC patients. I have been researching chilli also as there is a link between the fiery peppers cause a burning sensation when we eat them by stimulating certain receptors in the gut or mouth.\\n\\nNow, the bad news is that if you want to fix UC it is expensive to go out on a limb and experiment with supplements etc, however the bowel is not absorbing properly and the immune system is fighting overtime so desperate actions need to take place. My GI has not helped with my diet, i think this is something that your husband needs to do, and be patient, it won\\'t just happen over night - but the GI is a seperate component - we are what we eat. All the best x\\nHas he had endoscopy and colonoscopy? He could be misdiagnosed. I have crohn\\'s and uc and Remicade is the only thing that helped me.

And for the record I've seen 3 doctors in the past year, they don't want to test me or anything because they all think whatever I come to them about is an isolated issue and not a big deal because I'm young(23) and otherwise very healthy. Thanks doc.. These are my symptoms that started almost a year ago:\\n\\n1. Digestive issues: this isn't extreme, many days I'm completely normal (no pain, bowel movement once or twice a day), but every few weeks I'll have an unexplained period of days where I'm either constipated/have hard stool or I go too much instead, like 4 times an afternoon(this more commonly). And once in a while, in the morning right before I go, I get these excruciating abdominal pains that don't go away until I have a bm.\\n\\n2. Anal fissures(cause bleeding and pain sometimes after hard stool), external hemorrhoids and a perianal abcsess that I had drained, then re-drained and put on antibiotics for two weeks, but that is still leaking and causing some discomfort every few days (this is 2 months after the initial abcess).\\n\\n3. Cannot gain weight- note, this may be unrelated and not a problem as I am not sickly thin, I have always been pretty thin, but it's frustrating because I would like to put on a bit of weight (people do comment on how thin I am) and I eat whatever I feel like and more but I don't gain at all.\\n\\nSo, doctors brush me off and I'm not wanting to try to get surgery on the abscess/fistula whatever it is now until I'm completely desperate. I am managing all this by taking fibre and water, generally taking it easy, not sitting for long periods of time also when that is acting up.\\nI have a family friend who has Crohn's and sometimes when I think about his problems I wonder if I have a mild version or something. I'm just wondering if I'm doing ok or if I should be freaking out or doing something else. Ok thanks for listening to my sob story.\\n\\nAnnaEmily,\\nIt sounds like you may have a case of IBS.  The only thing throwing me off is the fistula that you had drained.  That is actually a symptom that GI doctors look for when trying to diagnose Crohns.  I am kind of in the same boat that you are, only I cannot stop going.  I go from 14-20 times a day and once it was over 105 times in less than a 36 hour period.  I ended up in the hospital due to severe dehydration. I have had all of the tests done, and I am only 29.  My doctors keep telling me that I am also too young to have problems, although Crohn's runs heavily in my family.  However, upon examination, my intestines show no signs of Crohn's disease.  I have seen numerous doctors as well.  The only thing I can tell you is do not give up.  Keep getting other opinions until you can find a doctor that will listen to you.  I was a nurse for several years, and I worked for some doctors that didn't care, and some that did everything in their power to help someone.  So I know there are good doctors out there, although I have not found any that specialize in GI problems yet.  You are not too young for IBS.  In fact, even though my GI doctor told me that I do not have IBS, my family physician said that IBS is what they diagnose you with when they cannot find a cause for your GI problems.  FYI, my ex GI doctor was an idiot, so I stopped seeing her.  Any one of any age can have IBS, because a lot of times it is caused by stress, but it can be genetic.  Like I said, just keep searching for other opinions, and tell your doctor that you want them to listen to you and take you seriously, and if that is not what they are willing to do then they do not need to waste your time or their's.  I wish you the best of luck.\\nHi Aldunn, thanks for the reply. Guess what.. I do have Crohn's. Since I posted that I ended up moving, got a new doctor, told her my issues and she suspected it right away, sent me to a GI who I just finally got to see, and he said that he is almost completely sure I have it but I have to get some more tests done. And he referred me to a surgeon, because that fistula I was talking about is still there :[. So, yeah I'm not happy about having this, but at least things are finally being recognized and moving towards sorting it out. You are so right about needing to be persistent and get a good doctor; it's frustrating but it seems like things need to get really bad before someone will take your situation seriously. The fact that you have to run to the bathroom so much sounds like Crohns or UC too, or maybe just IBS like you said, it really shows up different in different people. I've tried to stick to the bland low fibre/residue diet to some extent and it helps a little, but being distracted and generally un-stressed helps the most. Good luck to you too hang in there\",\n",

I have to eat to take my pills but feel really bad after eating and taking my pills. It is so annoying that I stall breakfast as long as I can but know I need to take my medicine. Anyone have any suggestions?\\nHi...has the nausea been increasing or always been there?  The reason I'm asking is that a flare starting can cause limited rectal inflammation.  With that, messages to the digestive system tend to slow down and sometimes become a little fussy.\\n\\nAre you having any other symptoms such as smaller, harder bms, more gas, mucus, etc?\\n\\nYou could ask your doctor to give you an antispasmodic...I use dicyclomine (Bentyl in the US).  Take it when you get up and it might help lessen the nausea.\\n\\nThe other option is to take Zantac a half hour before eating.  It can increase the digestive tract a bit, lessen the acidity and that could help with nausea.\\n\\nHave you had your liver enzymes checked recently?\\n\\nDo you have it every morning?  Sometimes with consuming higher fats the evening before....it can cause nausea in some people.\\n\\nHope you feel better soon...nausea is definitely one of the worst symptoms.\\nq\\nIs the nausea after you take the meds, or do you wake up already nauseous?  If it's after you've taken your meds, can you switch the time around when to take them?\\nI get nausea about an hour after I eat and take my pills. I have everything checked with a blood test every 4 months. This doesn't happen every day but is so annoying when it happens and I'm trying to go out.\\nI know some people take their Imuran at night before bed because it makes them feel sick in the morning.   So maybe just switching things up, taking meds at a different time of day, eating first, then waiting a bit to take the meds, etc may help.\\n\\nI go through periods where I feel nauseous but I think it's related more to gastritis flare ups than my UC or my meds.\\n\\nHope you figure it out!\",\n",

Sadly he keeps flaring. So having colon removal surgery is becoming a possibility in the very near future. So of course first step in surgery is to have his colon removed and then have an ostomy bag put on. He will have have the bag for at least 2-3 months, then go for 2nd surgery to remove bag, and have J-pouch connected to let him poop normally. My son doesn\\'t even know if he wants a j-pouch, as some people we know have the pouch and get constant pouchitis ( I know everyone is different)......but anyway he keeps saying he may want the ostomy bag as a permanent thing instead of having a j-pouch. He say the few people we know who have the j-pouch are still going poop many, many times a day, dealing with butt burn from constant pooping, and then the pouchitis I mentioned..... even 2 to 4 years after the pouch was made. PLEASE HELP.....does anyone out there have a permanent ostomy bag? Can you do anything? eat anything? is the worst thing about the bag, soreness where you change the bag where the adhesive is? And if you have the j-pouch, how is that for you? We are stressed of course!!!  THANK YOU!!!\\nI have had a colostomy since 1991, I think. I have Crohn\\'s and also had rectal prolapse with incontinence. Until 2006, I insisted on keeping my rectum \"just in case\" I ever wanted my bag reversed. I am a bit unique in that I irrigate my ostomy every morning in the hope that it will minimize output for the rest of the day...it doesn\\'t always, so I have to wear a bag all the time. I even went thru a divorce and back into the dating world in my mid 30\\'s with it! Scary! I would be more than willing to answer any questions you have as I am also an RN so I am not the least bit shy about it. It doesn\\'t hurt to change it, yes, I would rather not have it, but I did not like the thought of depends either! I do whatever I want to do and whatever I did before surgery as far as activities go. Hope this was helpful. Angelriv\\nHi Angel.....Thank you so much for your reply. Our son is so worried and scared about having an ostomy bag. He is 22 and basically missed out on all the fun things that teenagers do......and now as a young man, he is always sick....stomach pains, diarrhea, stomach cramps......his Colitis always flares, so poor kid is always on steroids. We KNOW he needs he surgery.....in fact tomorrow we have an appointment with a surgeon we already talked too, to go over more questions.  Our main question is.....if our son wants a temporary bag, we know the rectum is left, and a rectal stump is there......we have read that MANY people have discharge from this stump.....like mucus, and many people, men and women have to wear pads in case their butt \"leaks\".......do you have this? or had it? I was unclear if you went back and had your rectum and anus removed and you now have a permanent ostomy bag.  I know some people go in and get a permanent bag right away, so they don\\'t have to deal with rectum issues.....or they get a bag right away because they don\\'t want a j-pouch (we have heard many people suffer from j-pouch issues like pouchitis and cuffitis. So boy lots of things to think about!!!!! But if you could answer our question about that rectum leakage we would appreciate it.  THANK YOU SO MUCH ANGEL!!!!\\n56 yr male. Put off ileostomy because of UC to the point I was 24-48 hrs away from dying of sepsis. At first I could not like the stoma. Not happy. But gradually after 1 yr started to appreciate the freedom it now allows. Changing bag is a little involved but no big deal. You\\'ll develop your own systems which make you feel good. I had also heard there are many people regretting the reversal surgery for exactly the reasons you mention. On the other hand I have read about youngsters your age who love the bag because it allows them to live a full active life. Why not allow yourself a year with bag and then decide what you want to do. I don\\'t have any issues with unexpected mucus. I get a discharge every now and again but easily controlled to where I let it happen when emptying bag. Good luck and sorry to see yet another young person have to deal with this. But, I am told, it is an issue for the young.',\n",

       " {'post': 'I have a 23 year old daughter who has had bowel issues most of her life. I had her scoped at Riley when she was 7 years old...found nothing. She has been to the ER, gynecologist, urgent care, our family PCP, GI for a 2nd colonoscopy a few months ago, gallbladder ultrasound, tons of labs and stool tests, and nothing. She does fine for awhile..sometimes weeks, months..then seems like out of nowhere she\\'s running to the bathroom with severe diarrhea. Her stools are more times liquid than not. She\\'s had a celiac panel done and that was negative. The most recent colonoscopy she had a few months back the GI doc was concerned about two things. Her sigmoid colon he said was inflamed and looked as if it could be Crohn\\'s or UC so he did biopsies. The second thing concerning to him was he said for a 23 year old she has extremely abnormally large veins in her colon..as large as his fingers he stated....he labeled this as \"pelvic congestion syndrome\" and suggested we see a gynecologist. The biopsies he took were normal by the way.\\nOkay so this past week she began having severe lower abd pain..below her navel..so bad and so intense she couldn\\'t even move till the pain let up. Then a few hours later she began having bloody diarrhea..bright red blood..every 15-20 minutes the pain would come in waves and start up and would last before, during her bowel movement then it would stop and the pain would go away..until a few more minutes later then repeat. This went on for hours and I have never seen her in so much pain. I got her in that same day with our doc who sent her straight to hospital for a STAT CT scan of abdomen/pelvis and labs and stool tests. Next thing I know she is admitted for sepsis and colitis. Sepsis is infection in the bloodstream and is very serious. They said her entire colon...not just a section, but rather her entire colon was full of infection and she needed IV antibiotics right away. Her temp was 102.1, pulse got over 170 and it was very scary to say the least. She began vomiting bile at one point, dry heaving nonstop and literally had over 40 bouts of diarrhea in a matter of hours. She was so dehydrated that they could hardly find a vein for the IV to go in. They had blood transfusion on standby for her just in case but thankfully all she lost was 1 pint and didn\\'t need it.\\nShe was in the hospital for 2 nights and just followed up with her regular GI doc..not the on call one that she had during her hospital stay. He informed us at today\\'s visit that they found no bacteria in her labs/stool, cdifficile was negative, no ova or parasites. Her WBC was 17 and her Crp was 70!! He ordered a Prometheus IBD serology 7 blood test which we had drawn today. He said this can help indicate if this is truly Crohn\\'s or UC and if it comes back indicating one of these two..he wants to scope her again and get more tissues.\\nI am just looking for advice, if anyone has went through anything similar or can give me any input at all I would greatly appreciate it. We have been trying to get answers to her issues for years and years. She can eat something and within a matter of minutes she is running to the bathroom. She is still on 2 antibiotics to clear the infection too. Just very scary and need input. Thank you in advance\\n(I\\'m writing this on my phone, so excuse errors). I have to tell you, reading this gave me chills. This was me 10 years ago, down to the letter (though I had just turned 25). I was on prednisone for 4 months after my initial hospitalization and gained 80 pounds. I always tell people to avoid steroids for long periods of time. They mask symptoms and have god awful side effects. After trying all of the first and second line drugs (asacol, imuran, etc) I started on remicade. It has quite literally saved my life (or at least my colon). I\\'ve been on it for about 9 years and have had only minimal flares. I\\'ve been very lucky with it, though they did see some disease in a part of my colon that was not diseased before during my last colonoscopy. Luckily, 9 years have brought many new options, so I have a few drugs to fall back on if the remicade stops working (humira, entyvio, etc).\\n\\nMy biggest pieces of advice are these:\\n1. Don\\'t let her settle - the goal should always be symptom-free. Fight for it.\\n2. Research all of your options. There is tons of great info out there. Know what you are getting into. These are heavy duty drugs. Side effects can be severe, particularly with remicade and other immune suppressants.\\n3. Like your doctor. It makes a huge difference to feel like you are supported and heard.\\n4. Stay positive. IT WILL GET BETTER.\\n\\nGood luck.\\nThank you for your reply! If you don\\'t mind me asking you though...what exactly is your diagnosis? My daughter is a full-time college student majoring in business, plus works three jobs. She is worried this is going to become an even bigger issue and interfere with her life in a big way.',\n",

I also had a few days a while back where the first day i had an excruciating migraine, chills, severe abdominal pain\\nand diarrhea like i had taken laxatives.  it slowly got better over several days and at the time i assumed it was gluten but now i\\'m doubtful. does this sound like crohn\\'s disease or could it be something else? i think i need to find a new GI to consult!\\nI\\'m also very tired a lot and have days where my legs ache so bad.  it\\'s like the bones ache deep within and i can\\'t stand for very long without feeling very fatigued.

Thanks!!\\n\\nOh and i also have mucus in my loose stool at times :/\\nHi! I have no idea if you may have crohns, but wanted to tell you a bit about my story and what\\'s helped, because it\\'s fairly similar to yours.\\n\\nMy issues started at age 26, when I woke up one morning with a new body. Rather, a DIFFERENT body. In fact, it was like I had developed the bowels of a 90 year old overnight. Why? No clue. But ever since then, (I\\'m almost 34 now) my life has never been the same.\\n\\nCompletely unpredictable loose stools/watery raging diarrhea/several urgent bowel movements daily, and overwhelming fatigue were my biggest symptoms. I was beginning to have accidents sometimes directly after putting any piece of food in my mouth - just crazy fast reactions to the act of eating food. On days I had to work, I didn\\'t eat until I got home. I lost a lot of weight pretty quickly that way, lol. I was 5\\'6\" and 115 pounds, which is very thin on my frame. I was losing hair, very pale and sooooo tired, etc.\\n\\nI spent YEARS and thousands of dollars pursuing this ailment; nevermind the sudden hormonal changes, weird periods, migraines, black spots in my vision, extreme fatigue, and so on and so forth. Negative biopsy and blood test for celiac. No polyps, nothing detected from colonoscopy. Endoscopy revealed no damaged villi, nothing. Countless blood tests, 3 SIBO tests over 4 years, stool tests for parasites - Nothing. Not my gallbladder. Hormones are perfect, yaddi yadda.\\n\\nEventually, after feeling like a sickly scabby lab rat, I gave up. For the past 3 years I have simply been living with this ailment, with not a single iota of information since the 1st day it started. Over time, I have learned that certain dietary factors play a part. I haven\\'t found the cure, or the cause, but I know to avoid any artificial sweeteners or sugar alcohols, consume as little fat and grease/oil as possible, NO fibrous fruits like apples, pears, oranges, peaches...Those things all have a laxative effect to them, and for people like me, they must be avoided.\\n\\nToday I eat mostly whole foods, try to cook everything myself and simply deal with the consequences. If I have to go out to eat at a restaurant (Minefield, let me tell you! Avoid at any cost possible), I pre-medicate for at least two days with Imodium or generic loperamide. It\\'s the best thing I\\'ve found to help my symptoms with very little noticeable side effect; more effective than the antispasmodics, the opiates, fiber supplements, probiotics, and the cholestyramine, etc.\\n\\nAside from diet triggers and loperamide, digestive enzymes help a bit, but I\\'m bad at taking them religiously when eating a meal. I also used betaine HCL for a while to increase my stomach acid, and that was helpful for a long period until the effects seemed to wear off. That is something I might consider if I were you - low stomach acid.\\n\\nAnyway, good luck! Gotta go\\n',\n",

CT scan showed most of colon inflamed, possible diverticulitis on the left. Three days of IV antibiotics but colon is too inflamed to do a colonoscopy, will have that in 4 weeks. For the month prior I have been experiencing pain on my spine between shoulder blades with nausea & pain like being punched in the stomach. I was waiting for results of an abdominal ultrasound to check gallbladder...got the call from pcp office while in the ER saying no gallstones lol. Diagnosed with colitis, determined it's not caused by infection. Blood pressure was very low during the stay in hospital. Only thing that I did learn is no more chocolate 😕 I had a chocolate pop tart a few hours before the pain began, pain subsided while inpatient until I was given a chocolate chip cookie, then started again but less intense & no blood. This pain isn't new for me, but the blood is. I'm very curious if this is Crohn's or UC. Any input would be helpful 🙂\\nHi...you won't know much more until you have the c-scope.  I'm assuming you've already had stool sampling done.\\n\\nRegarding the gallbladder....fatty foods will definitely give you pain in that area.  It's good you don't have any stones.\\n\\nWhat meds have they given you?  Even if it is or isn't UC or CD, I'd suggest that they at least give you a mesalamine oral medication and that the doctor could at least give you a rectal exam to see if you have inflammation there.  If you do....then add a rectal mesalamine retention enema to the mix.\\n\\nThose medications are in the first tier of treatment, and they should help take down your inflammation in the next few weeks...enough for you to have your c-scope.\\n\\nI will strongly advise you to get copies of absolutely ALL your test results, that includes stool, x-rays, ultrasound, c-scope biopsies..anything you have done.  The reason is for your files/information so that you can do research, ask questions to others and formulate a dialogue with your doctor regarding diagnosis.\\n\\nKeep us updated how you're doing.\\n\\nq\\nThank you quincy! The only result I know from stool sample is colitis isn't caused by bacteria or infection. Rectal was quick, no hemorrhoid or fissure. Was given Flagyl & Cipro iv inpatient and carafate 4x day & prilosec for home. Today was my first day out & standing/walking for awhile, felt lightheaded & pressure on back to front (upper middle)...feels more like esophagus than colon or gallbladder..? Felt more like the shortness of breath after getting hit in stomach, not really painful. Thank you so much for your reply\\n\\nI don't know anything about t he d is eases but I do know about cidpro. You need to research it's side effects. It caused me to have terrible rib pain and can cause weird pain anywhere. Muscular or whatever. Ask your pharmacist. I had to have steroid  injections.\\n\\nIf you were on any sort of steroid prior to the cidpro can cause an interaction as well.\\n\\nCathy\\nHope they continue to do further testing...especially an upper endoscopy to rule out anything there.\\n\\nq\\nHI there\\n\\nThe hospital just told me that Lat night, too. 😳\\n\\nKinda scary.  I'm new at this. Have you been diagnosed long?\\n\\nMe, just today.\\n\\nCan we have surgery to help?\\n\\nWell, you are not alone, my friend.  😄💙\\n\\nWe can do this. So sorry for your pain!\\nHI.

After cutting them out I managed to cope ok however, the symptoms are much worse and uncontrollable. I have recently been to see the doctor as everyday I have found blood and mucus in the stools and my health is deteriorating dramatically. This has panicked me because although lots of my family members have IBS some members of the family also suffer from crohns and colitis. After going to the doctors, they did an examination and found piles which they believed are causing the bleeding. After having stool and blood tests they showed no inflammation nor infection. Is it normal to have blood and mucus in the stool, flare ups every couple of weeks/months? Nausea? Muscle aches and pains? Bloating and burning stomach? Tenderness of stomach?Tiredness? Fatigue? Sever headaches? Hair loss? Left lower abdomen pain? In May this year I was also diagnosed with anemia and so was put on iron deficiency tablets and b12 tablets to bring them to a normal level.\\n\\nThe reason I ask is because I have been reading other people's stories and they have been misdiagnosed for years with IBS when there is something more to it. The doctor offered to refer me for a colonoscopy however, I feel as though I would be wasting the NHS' time and resources when this could just be IBS?\\nI think you should have the colonoscopy done just to be sure what's going on.\\n\\nBest of luck to you.\\nThe only way to know is to have a colonoscopy.\\n\\nColitis is a general term for inflammation of the colon.  There are different types of colitis such as antibiotic induced, viral, bacterial, parasitic, microscopic, crohn's, ulcerative, ischemic ...to name a few.\\nA diagnosis is best, especially if early.  Besides, you have low B12, and that should be investigated.  It is absorbed through the small intestine, so a small bowel follow-through and celiac testing should be done as well.\\nYou should also have stool sampling done.\\n\\nThose with an inflammatory chronic bowel disease can also have IBS, so the confusion of symptoms can cause much distress at the constant guessing.\\n\\nHaving nothing done won't change what's actually going on.  Best to have proper testing considering your family history.\\n\\nLet us know the outcome.\\n\\nq\\nThank you for your reply,\\n\\nI have been tested for celiac and that came back negative. I also had some stool samples done and they said there was no form of infection.\\n\\nI am going to the doctors to ask for a colonoscopy just to be sure.\\nRequest to have biopsies done because of your family history, as well as that inflammation can be present without visual clues sometimes.

I had a colonoscopy last week to check the status of my bowel and there is only a small degree of inflammation near my cecum so my gastroenterologist considers me \"in remission\" and told me to go for it. I got called today, however, about a low WBC of 3.5. He didn\\'t mention the IVF  in his message and is out of town for a few weeks so I can\\'t ask him the implications. He has told me to reduce my 6MP from 75mg to 50mg and to get weekly blood tests. I am just wondering whether I should keep my IVF appointments (I\\'m keen to because it\\'s so hard to book so far in advance and to know how well I will be), or whether I would be better to do the first part of generating embryos (which is the most stressful/difficult part and the part I need to book ahead for) but hold off on implanting anything because it might be better to stabilise my bloods before maintaining a pregnancy, or am I silly to embark on IVF at all at the moment? I also suffer from anxiety and would rather do IVF and be pregnant when I\\'m well on that front (which I am at the moment).\\nI\\'d be interested in any thoughts.\\nCheers.',\n",

       " {'post': \"Okay so this is an update to my last post. I seen gastro yesterday. He told me I had a fissure and a roid. He also told me he thought I had an obstruction. My pcp is concerned I have crohns or uc. I had a scope last July and that doc (apparently an idiot) told me I had colitis, take levsin and colitis would take care of itself. Nice. When I told my new gastro that yesterday it was obvious he didn't agree or approve. He said I must have IBD from what the scope results said. So back to the obstruction thing, he immediately sent me for X-rays and had me bring them back immediately. Apparently, my colon is completely FULL (which makes NO sense due to the fact I go 2-12x a day and have for a month now) anyhow he scheduled me for upper and lower scope April 11. I have never had both done just the one lower. He said he can't decide on the cause of the plumbing issues for sure till he does the scope in the meantime, he told me to do a colonoscopy prep yesterday just to get my colon to empty. It hasn't happened yet. I mean I'm going but nothing more than I always do. I got nausea and vomiting last night with it but that too is not a new thing for me. I called nurse today with my concerns and she said to repeat the colonoscopy prep today for a second go of it. Ugh! I took mineral oil at 1:30. No change. I am about to start my round 2 do the prep and am dreading it. I am so confused as to my situation and was hoping someone out there has had the same problem and can give me some info! Anything is helpful! Thank you so much I so appreciate it!!\\nThe give you anesthesia for the lower and I was completely knocked out! Didn't even remember coming home or anything lol I really hope they do that again for the upper and lower. I'm pretty nervous of the scope ging down my throat. I will not handle that well lol\\nHi...so you're having the scopes done today?  Hope you were able to finish the preps.  I, personally, prefer the gallon preps...they work well.\\n\\nRegarding obstruction...did the doc mean stool compaction or inflammation?\\n\\nI hope you get some answers.\\n\\nLooking forward to your updates once you've recovered from the meds.\\nq\\nHi. No scope till April 11th. Just had to do the preps to empty colon out. Gastro told me Wednesday the x rays showed it was completely full of stools. Just went back for more x rays cause I don't think the preps are working. What color are stools on xray?\\nHaha sounds like me when my husband had his wisdom teeth cut out lol thanks for the info I appreciate it!\\nUpdate. X-rays Friday showed I was still about 30% full even after both colonoscopy preps back to back plus the mineral oil. :/ pcp (gastro was out for holiday) said do my capful of miralax, 2 pills of sendocot, and 2 pills of fiber choice pre biotic pills daily through the weekend and touch base on Monday. Called today and he sent me for more xray. His nurse called and said my right colon (right side is always swollen and hurting) was mild to moderatley full. Whatever that means. She couldn't give me a percentage today. Pcp wanted me to take 6 pills of sendocot asap and wait 4 hours then drink a bottle of magnesium citrate and repeat xrays in 24 hours. what?!? really?!? more stuff? after 2 scope preps, mineral oil plus all thise laxatives all weekend i still havent emptied im pretty sure his suggestions tonight wouldnt work wither... i explained this to my gastro nurse when i dropped off the xrays from friday and today. My gastro wanted to see X-rays from today and Friday. When I took those in my gastro had already left but should review them first thing tomorrow. His nurse told me to hold off on doing the prep the pcp wanted me to do. I think she feels the same way I do that nothing is working so something has to be done. So I have ibd, but they aren't sure of anything further until my scope set for the 11th. My thoughts are how do they plan to do a scope when we can't get it to empty after all this?! Sigh. Could be worse i reckon... Lol\\nHaha! Oh yeah I'm confused, worried, frustrated! I don't get it! Yes I'm still having bm. It doesn't make any sense to me at all. Everything has changed since this all started feb 22. Nothing makes sense anymore. That's why I didn't go ahead with the other prep stuff my pcp said to do last night. I seriously doubt it will work since nothing else is working. I mean in a sense it is working. Last wed my gastro told me my colon was 100% full. Even though I would go like 2-12 x a day. That's when the first prep took place. Then the second. Fridays x rays said I still had like 30-40% stool left inside. That's when gastro was closed for holiday so pcp did the X-rays and said to do all the laxatives over the weekend and call him yesterday. I did that. X-rays showed there is still mild to moderatley full on right colon. What mild to moderately full means I have no idea. I asked for the percentage so I could compare it to Fridays 30-40% but the nurse didn't have the percentage yesterday. I hope my gastro calls this am with some answers. My right side still hurts and is swollen. Has been since feb 24. I have no idea how they plan to scope me on the 11th! We haven't got that far yet! As for now, I don't want another prep. It prob aint gonna work. Lol on the other hand, what choices do I have?  I don't even know if there's anything else to do!?\\nOk so gastro called. Right colon is still full. Apparently quite full his nurse said. SO, now he has me doing 2tbsp milk of mag with 2tbsp mineral oil 3x a day for 5days then he will repeat my X-rays. Sigh. He also wants me to try samples of linzess... Apparently its for constipation which makes no sense to me since I go all the time but my colon will not empty. Is this a common issue with ibd? Is my doc on the right track or should I demand something be done now rather than wait it out another 5 days? I don't know what to do. Today it's really hurting. They said it hurts because its so full. They didn't tell me to take anything for the pain tho. So I'm debating calling them to see what I can take for that.\\nLong story short...been sick since feb 22. Swollen since feb 24. I have ibd was told I had colitis last July. Doc said it would take care of itself. I have fibro. Fast forward. I have had 3 sets of X-rays. All showing colon is full. I have gone through 2 colonoscopy preps back to back, mineral oil, miralax, senocot, fiber choice pre biotic pills, and now gastro wants to do do 2tbsp mineral oil with 2tbsp milk of mag 3x a day for 5 days then repeat X-rays. He gave me samples today of linzess to try. It's apparently for constipation which makes NO sense considering I can go anywhere from 2-12x a day but colon WILL NOT WMPTY! I'm in pain, swollen, nauseous and just don't feel good. Is this common?!? Should I wait out the next 5 days or demand something else be done ASAP. Is there anything else that can be done?!? I have no idea!\\nJust to clarify your obviously indepth research and educated knowledge of the colon length...it's around 5 feet(more or less), NOT 22 feet.\\nq\",\n",

Thanks\\nHi Alex.\\nYou don\\'t say if you have crohns or colitis so I\\'m only guessing that you do, and that the incontinence you mention is from your bowel rather than bladder.\\nI\\'m only recently diagnosed with crohns, and suffered a few times with a small amount of this but only when I didn\\'t quite make it to the toilet in time when I had the morning urgency to empty my bowels. It was a watery leakage rather than anything more, initially I thought I was going to break wind...but it was a little more than just wind!\\nMy feeling is that if this is affecting how you live your life and making you anxious or less confident in certain situations then it needs looking into and perhaps you need to make an appointment with your GP specifically to discuss this rather than it getting \\'overlooked\\'. Perhaps he doesn\\'t actually realise how much this problem is affecting you if you\\'ve not pursued the conversation?\\nGood luck\\nSue x\\nUrinary incontinence can be linked to hypothyroidism so I\\'d have my thyroid checked.

       " {'post': 'First of all, I am so grateful to have found this message board - I am one of those \"I have support but no one actually \\'gets\\' what I\\'ve been going through\" sufferers.\\n\\nLast May I thought I had food poisoning; however, it didn\\'t ease up at all and I suffered through painful diarrhea,  vomiting, and some pretty severe lower left abdominal pain until July (when I finally got health insurance and saw a doctor). I was referred to a GI doctor who recommended I have a colonoscopy/endoscopy. He found a small area of inflammation in my colon and biopsy results stated I had colitis. I had several blood tests (including an IBD panel)  done but because I didn\\'t have \"classic\" presentation, I was given a diagnosis of indeterminate colitis.\\n\\nI was on several medications and started to feel better. In November, my gallbladder decided it no longer felt like functioning so I had to have it removed. Initially, I had significant diarrhea and heartburn but was given some new medication that essentially made me feel like a million bucks. I sincerely thought my troubles were over.\\n\\nRight before Christmas I started having extremely bad diarrhea and vomiting and my lower left abdomen began hurting something fierce. I contacted my doctor who put me back on all my medications and said this was probably a flare-up and wanted to do another colonoscopy.\\n\\nToday I actually had the colonoscopy done and the doctor told me my colon looked completely normal (the prior inflammation was gone as well). Because they did not do the endoscopy today, he scheduled me for a CT Scan next week to see if anything is wrong with my small intestines.\\n\\nI am completely at a loss here. It\\'s extremely distressing to me to be told my colon looked fine and yet my symptoms now are far worse than when I initially got sick. I\\'m afraid everything will come back normal and I\\'m going to be left to assume it\\'s \"all in my head\" or (worst yet!) everyone else will assume that.\\n\\nI\\'m hoping that by joining this message board, I won\\'t feel so alone. I\\'m seeking words of wisdom and/or any sort of advice that can make this whole process just a bit more bearable.\\nHi jennifer. I am reasonably new here myself but not new to colitis - i have had it for about 8 years, my mum has it and her mum had it. I also have ibs which i think may be causing the pain and loose bowels that you are experiencing currently.\\n\\nCan i ask has there been any blood or mucus in your stool? Also what medication are you on for the colitis?\\n\\nI am on my way out the door at the moment but would like to take the time once I\\'m back to give some detail on how my ibs was controlled together with mu colitis.\\n\\nI\\'d love it if you could answer my questions above in the meantime though as they may help.\\n\\nStay positive, there are things that will help :-)\\nHi again jennifer.\\n\\nI understand exactly what you are saying about the diagnosis,  i was relieved when i was diagnoses by a gastroentriologist with ulcerative colitis because i then had a name for the beast and could have it treated with certainty from there. More recently a rheumatologist diagnosed me with lupus,  i tell you that was a relief mostly because people around me didn\\'t believe there was anything really wrong with me,  they thought i was just being a hypochondriac.\\n\\nThere may be some results in your upcoming tests but in the meantime, I\\'ll tell you a few tricks that i have up my sleeve for reducing the pain and bowel motions etc.  Firstly, I\\'ve never been much of a vomiter so that doesn\\'t fall under my list of symptoms,   i know people with food intolerances who do get sick in the stomach though, it\\'s just not the way i react so don\\'t rule out the food being an issue because in my case that symptom doesn\\'t occur.\\n\\nIt is quite hard to identify food intolerance from colitis. Nowadays i can tell but at first i thought i was still flaring but the gastroentriologist said i was not.  I was going to the bathroom at least 6 times a day and had regular cramping and he knew it was food intolerance  causing that current issue and sent me to a dietician specializing in inflammatory bowel disease.\\n\\nThe dietician put me on a very strict (no deviations) elimination diet for 2 months which had my  bathroom visits down to 2-3 a day in the end. She was able to identify from this, what foods were causing my issues.  She also sent me in for hydrogen  breath testing which checks if you react to fructose and lactose.\\n\\nThe dietician is necessary because not all foods are easily identified as an issue, just skipping them for a day or even a week may not show any difference.\\n\\nI highly recommend you see one after your results are all in to eliminate other causes.  If you do, make sure the dietician specializes in inflammatory bowel disease or in irritable bowel syndrome.\\n\\ni had no food intolerances until i got ulcerative colitis and then my body decided it didn\\'t like wheat, onion, apple,  mango, pear, corn, some dairy,  legumes, beans, artificial sweeteners, tofu, beancurd and the list goes on... stress also causes issues with the bowels as i am sure you already know.\\n\\ni should tell you how I identify a flare from food intolerance too... There is blood or mucous or both in my stool during a flare. One thing that happens quite often too is that i pass only mucous with a lot of urgency first thing in the morning if i am flaring. during a flare i strip back my diet a lot and am usually put on prednisone and higher dosages of my existing medications.\\n\\nIf you are not doing so already, i recommend that you eat a very plain diet until you get this sorted out.  Not a lot of dairy,  bread, pasta, legumes, spices and chillis acidic foods, fruits etc bananas are ok though. Eat vegetables (not onion beans cabbage) a bit of lean meat and fish.  Keep your diet as stripped back as you can and it should reduce your sickness.\\n\\ni wish you all the best and hope you find the answers to your problem. If you want to know any more about my experience please let me know. I am just another patient but i would love to help direct others in similar situations to my own to wellness :-)',\n",

       " {'post': 'My mom has crohns disease and colitis so it does run in my family.\\n\\nIn March I went to the dr concerning a pain on my right side, particularly after I eat, with bloating. I wasn\\'t experiencing constipation or diarrhea. I kept thinking it was my gallbladder but my ultrasound came out normal, despite having severe, debilitating pain. One dr thought I had costocrondritis but another dr thought she was wrong because it\\'s usually on the left side. I took an X-Ray but it showed nothing wrong in my chest.\\nThen I stated getting severe chest pain, chest clenching and heart burn. Finally a dr tested me for H pylori which tested positive. I went on the antibiotics, suffered extreme diarrhea, even after I stopped the antibiotics. I also experienced severe heartburn, acid reflex, throat pain, lasting for weeks at a time. I tried several PPIs, the only one that seems to be working the best (although not 100%) is dexilant which I am still on. I had an endoscopy in June, h pylori was eradicated, everything looked normal according to my GI doctor.\\nThese last few days I have been experiencing pain on my side again.. it feels like it is my ribs (more towards the side, not the inner rib area). It radiates up and down my ribs, it is worse after eating or if I hear gurgling or gas in my stomach. It is a pinching pain. I have had diarrhea and bloating for at least a week now.\\nCan this be ...\\nChronic IBS, maybe gas that is trapped ?\\nA muscle that I keep straining (poor posture, the way I workout .. ?)\\nGallbladder malfunction?\\nLiver?\\nH pylori again even though I eradicated it in April ?\\n\\nI went to the DR today and she said it is probably not my gallbladder, since the ultrasound did not show any stones when I had one in March.  She does not think it is h pylori.  She thinks it may be gas and IBS because the right side is my colon.  She told me to take Iberogast and peptobismol.  I told her that I had more diarrhea since being on the antibiotics in April, diarrhea was never really an issue for me, so she is making me get tested for C Diff.\\n\\nI\\'m just worried that this chronic pain on my right side may actually be colitis.. ?\\nI cannot link it to any particular food but I can say that I usually develop GERD symptoms when I am extremely stressed.\\nThe pain lasts days and days, it is exhausting and I don\\'t know what to do. I have an appt with my dr tomorrow.\\nIt doesn\\'t sound muscle related to me, certainly not the diarrhea and bloating.\\n\\nIBS is a definite possibility but is a diagnosis of exclusion. This means that other diseases (such as colitis) need to be ruled out.\\n\\nGallbladder malfunction is theoretically possible as sometimes the gallbladder is malfunctioning but there are no stones that would show up on ultrasound. The pain from this is often very severe (like go to the ER right now severe), which doesn\\'t seem to match your presentation. Also, the stool will often be pale or yellowish in this case.\\n\\nDoesn\\'t sound like hpylori. That usually presents with burning pain and is worse with an empty stomach.\\n\\nLiver doesn\\'t seem likely as there are usually other symptoms that go along with this like jaundice, itchy skin etc.\\n\\nColitis or colon related issues are possible. Diverticulitis presents similarly to what you mention above although the pain is generally pretty severe there as well. Colonoscopy would diagnose or rule out any of these. Colitis generally includes things like bloody stool although not always.\\n\\nIt\\'s a good thing your doctor is testing for C. Diff. as that could definitely cause problems like you mention.\\n\\nDexilant is also know to cause stomach pains, diarrhea and gas/bloating. Longer use is associated with more side effects.\\n\\nMy guess is that you are suffering either from the effects of the medication you\\'re on (dexilant and/or antibiotics) or IBS. I\\'m sure if you discuss this with your Dr she can chase down the cause or refer you to the appropriate specialist.\\n\\nGood luck and let us know how it goes...\\n\\nThanks for your response.  I went back to my doctor today because my pain is not getting better.  One day I will have diarrhea, the next I won\\'t have a bowel movement at all but I feel like I\\'m constipated for weeks.  Not all my bowel movements are diarrhea but I have had it more frequently.  When I took the stool test for C Diff last week it was not diarrhea, it was firm, and apparently it needs to be diarrhea for it to be able to test.  The lab didn\\'t tell me that though so I need to do the test again.\\n\\nI asked my dr if she thinks I should have an abdominal CT scan but she seemed unsure if it was worth exposing me to the radiation based on these symptoms.  She thinks a colonoscopy might be better at this point.  I don\\'t have an appt with my GI until November so I dont know what to do\\n\\nI agree with your Dr. Abdominal CTs are *a lot* of radiation, and I definitely wouldn\\'t get another one unless I *really* needed it. I had 2 of them in one year in 2012 and am pretty concerned about that, since I had one this year as well. Perhaps you can get her to expedite the appointment with the GI doc, or recommend one that is available earlier. Often, a call from the referring provider will bump you into the \"urgent\" category. Many clinicians reserve a few spaces for these \"urgent\" patients. I agree that waiting until November seems excessive.\\n\\nThe reason I had the CT scans in 2012 was because I had protracted symptoms like yours and also pretty severe nausea, pain and weight loss. In my case, it ended up with a diagnosis of IBS brought on by and in conjunction with gastritis.  The alternating diarrhea/constipation seems especially familiar although I was constipated more often. In my case, everything just went away after about 4.5 months.\\n\\nGood luck.',\n",

Are you on any fibre supplements?\\n\\nSorry for all the questions\\nq\\nHi Quincy-sorry it has taken so long to get back to you. As far as medications, my daughter has been on Apriso from the start, but continued to have bleeding and diahrea. This went on for about 6 months. She is taking Phillips Colon Health as her probiotic. She eats a really healthy diet so she hasn't been asked to take fiber supplements yet. She has had 4 Remi treatments so far, and they have been helping so much that her gastro is considering taking her off the Apriso all together, but she will still have to have the Remi infusions. She is scheduled for a colonscopy right after the holidays so the doc can see what is going on in there.\\nMy daughter was also advised to see a grief counselor. She was going to start therapy anyway, and this kind of counselor is helping her cope with the fact that at the ripe old age of 21 she is facing the rest of her life with this problem, barring someone coming up with a cure in her lifetime. It is a lot to soak up, and frankly I think she is kicking butt and taking names at this point. She is in school (junior year of college) full time, works about 30 hours a week, and does stuff with her friends. She was taking a bunch of difficult classes, which was ramping up the stress-which ramps up the UC-then her wise doc advised her to take at least one class that she would really enjoy, yet still get credit for it. She is back in choir now, and it brings her great joy.\\nHi, sounds as though your daughter is doing quite well at this point.  it'll be a her decision to go off the apriso....there are other 5asa orals as well as rectals for her to utilise.\\n\\ni wish her well.\\n\\nI do suggest a better probiotic taken at bedtime and fibre supplements such as metamucil capsules to be taken with meals.\\n\\nCounselling is a great idea for a variety of issues to help regain footing for life in general while dealing with UC.\\n\\nthanks for the reply....take good care,\\nq\\nHi all. Miles down the track i know! Just wanted to check how your daughter is doing now? I too was diagnosed with uc in my early 20s. Personally mezasalazine has been my savoir.  I take\\n2 x 1.2g tablets of mezavant daily and use the pentasa 1g suppositories 3-4 times a week and that has been great for day to day management. When i flare the suppositories are twice daily mezavant is 4 tabs daily and prednisolone is prescribed for a short period and it does the trick. My mother takes imuran and swears by it - she too has uc.\\n\\nIf your daughter is still going to the bathroom a significant amount more than 3 times daily, has she been to a dietician? Once i had my first uc flare under control, i had to then see a dietician because i was still going to the bathroom 5-10 times a day. She stripped back my diet and also arranged for me to have the fructose lactose breath test to determine why and alas it was ibs as well as uc (very common to have both) i now know what fodmaps to avoid to keep my bowels happy.\\n\\nHope the above helps in some way even though its a couple of months late! Happy new year\\n\\nHer Gastro suggested Phillips Colon Health, but what better ones are out there? She isn't one to deviate from her doc's advise, but in this case she might consider it.\\nShe did have one flare up over the holidays, but otherwise has really been doing well. They added Welbutrin to her regimen for depression, and it has REALLY helped the most.\\nNew Year Blessings to everyone here!\\nPhilips was suggested by my new Gastro also (old one retired) and I still found Culturelle to be better.\\n\\nI take a probiotic from Custom Probiotics a few times a week in place of the Culturelle and that seems to work well as it has more cultures in it and 5 strains which include Bifadis for the large intestine as well as Lactobacillus for the small intestine.\\n\\nHope this helps.\",\n",

I had diarrhea and cramping and threw up a few times.  After that everytime I would eat anything I would have diarrhea.  I am now eating chicken breast and green beans without the cramping.  I have been on Levaquin and Flaggel for a couple of weeks.  At ER they did a CT scan and said they found a colitis and thickening of my spenic flexture or a neoplasm.  I also had just blood.  Not bleeding any longer but still eating very little.  I have lost between 12 and 15 pounds since then.  I am scheduled to have a colonoscopy Tuesday.  Did you have any of these symptoms?\\nI'm sort of surprised they are doing a colonoscopy if you are bleeding - do not know where you live but if they have a virtual colonoscopy at least you would not have the scope stuck up you.  The cledanout is bad enough that you have to do for either.  Hope it does not start up the bleeding again with the watery diarehea.  Check with your doc that you are concerned about the clean out prep alone irritating you even more and let us know what he/she thinks.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I feel badly for all that are suffering from colitis. Pleae consider the complete elimination of dairy to cure yourself.   Dairy elimination consists of milk, cheese, yogurt, whey, cassein.  It is important to read labels because milk, whey, and cassein are in alot of surprising foods like bread, barbecue potato chips, cereal bars, granola bars, chocolate, and other things.\\n\\nI have cured myself this way because colitis is entirely related to milk proteins.   Butter has no effect for me and is fine to consume.  This is because the milk proteins cause the problem, butter is comprised of fat and little to no milk proteins.\\n\\nMany doctors will tell you that there is no relationship between diet and colitis.  This may be true for some people who might have a bacteria imbalance in which case a probiotic will help or who have some other cause.  However, diet is the cause for a good deal of people.  besides my personal experience, you will find studies and doctor blogs who anecdotally discuss dairy\\'s role and how dairy elimination can be a cure for some people.\\n\\nI hope this helps someone.\\nI agree completely  - am grateful for your advice.  My daughter was hospitalized with a dramatic flareup between Christmas and New Years.  Eliminating the triggers - and milk is certainly one of them - brings enormous relief.  Now to just figure out how to train a teenager to avoid the triggers completely.\\nHi both. Food intolerance does play a role in ulcerative colitis but as you said above, not for everyone.  There are also other foods that cause issues other than dairy too. A dietician can find these out for you as they did for me. Even if lactose is not flagged as something you are intolerant to, when flaring,  you need to eliminate it from your diet as much as possible together with any other rich foods.\\n\\nLactose isn\\'t a major problem for me, fructose is though which has eliminated quite a few things from my diet such as apple,  pear, mango, onion, wheat and need to keep corn to s minimum too. I also have issues with beans, legumes, chickpeas, lentils and even bean curd and tofu! Artificial sweeteners are also bad.\\n\\nSome of these things the dietician found for me as they are tricky yo identify when your system has a build up of them. To find out what was causing the issues a strict elimination diet had to be implemented for a couple of months which was monitored by the dietician. I also did hydrogen breath testing too which flagged my bodies reaction to the fructose.\\n\\nHope that helps you both and anyone else who is in a similar situation. Just know dairy isn\\'t necessarily everyone\\'s intolerance there are many more and a dietician (particularly one specializing in inflammatory bowel disease) has the knowhow to find the culprits.\\n\\nDuring a flare however, a very plain diet is needed and regardless of whether you are intolerant or not, dairy should be minimized as much as possible during this time together with any other rich or acidic foods.\\nThere\\'s no cure for UC, and stopping milk or any foods won\\'t cure it.\\nWhile food intake can have symptoms, one has to realise that they and UC are two different issue.\\n\\nq\\nHi quincy.  Agreed! I am on daily medication including suppositories for the uc which is proctitis treated by a gastroenterologist and i see a dietician for my ibs / the food intolerances. I can tell which one is flaring (blood and or mucous it\\'s colitis! ).\\n\\nmy partner has quite a lack of empathy so i need to leave him to believe that it is my colitis that acts up when i eat the wrong foods.  Given it is a \"disease\" he can understand that better than it being ibs. He is very careful of what foods we buy and understanding when i alter recipes or ask for no onion etc when we order food. I used to be a vegetarian for years before i saw him but it did his head in because it was a choice, i had to give it up for him and eat meat. Ibs he does not understand either, just lucky i have colitis to pin my food intolerances on!\\n\\nI think some other people are just like that as well, especially at the start of the disease. They can\\'t tell what\\'s ibs and whats colitis. They think food has cured it but it was just the ibs that stopped and colitis happens to be taking a break at the time too. I see people on here that are new to it who think their colitis is flaring even though a colonosopy has said they\\'re in the clear for now, they doubt their doctors! These people need to see a dietician because they have ibs but don\\'t realize it.\\n\\nAnyway thats my rant. Quincy,  hopefully you agree? Ibs is not taken seriously when there is a \"disease\" that causes similar symptoms. Sometimes people listen better if they think food intolerance is  part of the \"disease\", if it means it gets them to a dietician then I\\'m happy. The dietician\\'s explanation and diagnosis of ibs should then be accepted because they are a \"professional\".\\n\\nI guess the first thing the OP should clarify is if he/she actually has UC or another type of colitis.  IBS used to be called Mucus Colitis.\\n\\nFood intolerances, allergies or just by the normal action of food itself can cause differences in one\\'s digestion process/stool shapes, etc.\\n\\nDiet is subjective....and I wouldn\\'t consider eating many things that others consider comfort foods, bland foods, etc.  Yes, I get gas from too much milk, writhing painful gas from bananas and oats.  Do I eat them..on occasion, but would never consider certain things in the morning since I wouldn\\'t want discomfort during the day.\\n\\nPersonally, many dieticians don\\'t have a clue regarding specific issues unless they\\'re willing to offer many options for a client/patient and are able to describe why someone would be having some symptoms, etc.\\n\\nI\\'ve had many people ask me if I can eat certain foods or if I can\\'t, but I\\'ve never blamed anything on my disease.  If I\\'m flaring....just eating can cause butt spasming and possibly a dash to the bathroom, but the food itself has no bearing on that issue.\\n\\nYour choice to eat meat is probably a better thing for your body than remaining strict in withholding it.  Meat (and I mean all) contains nutrients for your body, is high protein...but you know all the benefits or you wouldn\\'t have included it.  Eggs are high on my diet..I have one or two every morning....depending on what time I get up and how long I\\'ll be going without eating.\\n\\nMy symptoms at the start of a flare are very specific and minimal visually (my doc didn\\'t believe me until recently...25 years later).  While I have IBS, it\\'s not debilitating.   I do take an antispasmodic, probiotics and fibre supplements.  I try to stay away from foods that cause excess gas, and yes...when I was first diagnosed I limited many foods because it would have been crazy to exacerbate loose stool, cramping or gas.  Once my meds kicked in and symptoms started to wane, I increased my intake of varied foods.\\n\\nYes, I agree with you that IBS isn\\'t taken seriously....but it isn\\'t UC.   It can happen in conjunction with UC or be more obvious while one is starting to flare or during healing. It takes a long time to differentiate food symptoms or IBS or UC symptoms.\\n\\nIn general, I don\\'t care what people believe about what I have....it\\'s unfortunate your partner has a lack of sympathy.  One day, just ask him what part he doesn\\'t get to clarify.  Sometimes it\\'s not what we might assume.\\n\\nq',\n",

His doctor never thought diet was a huge factor in his disease, although, our son does not eat poorly.....he hardly has sweets....no alcohol....rarely caffeine.....nothing hard to digest....so we feel he eats good, but in answer to your question, he follows no special diet for UC. If I may ask...wow 25 years with colitis?! What medication have you been on, that has held off surgery for you?  Feel better Dars!!\\nHi Anxiety Mom,\\nsorry to hear your son has no experienced remission in 7 years. I pray that he finds relief soon. As far as medication, usually a combination of 3 medicines helps control my UC and often puts it in remission: Asacol HD, Canasa Suppositories, and Rowasa Enemas. All three medications have the same chemical, Mesalamine. The Asacol HD is pill form and only pill form of Mesalamine that has worked for me ( there are others), the Canasa Suppositories reach the rectal area and are good and the Rowasa enemas reach deeper into the colon than the suppositories. The combination of all three make a big difference. Often my doctor will prescribe Prednisone on top of all that, its a steroid. But in the future, I'd like to avoid it because it can cause osteoporosis, even in men. I never want sugery...it would be horrible to have any part of my colon removed. I'd rather keep my colon and deal with flareups.\\n\\nI wish your son all the best...God bless you and your son. - Dars.\\nThank you Dars. You are very blessed to be on Asacol, the enemas and suppositories.......and no biologics.  Jake has been on the three you are on, but sadly didn't work for him. Yes, surgery is something no one wants to do, but Jake has been on 3 biologics and years and years of off and on steroids.....and as you know steroids are not good at all for a person. We are afraid they have already wrecked havoc on his body, so surgery may finally give him relief. He flares so often, he really can't live a full life.

Liver ok?\\nHello dinayinyang,\\nI guess you meant hydrocodone. This looks like a painkiller, like codeine and morphine.\\nI think the risk to the liver comes from paracetamol (active ingredient of tylenol). The pill that you are going to take might have 300 mg of paracetamol. So it is not a good idea to take this pill and also tylenol because that might cause a paracetamol overdose. I think the daily max for paracetamol is 4 g.\\n\\nI know that codeine is sometimes sold like that = paracetamol + codeine + caffeine\\nor ibuprofen + codeine + caffeine\\nand some of them have no caffeine at all.\\nThe idea is to enhance the effect of the codeine, so you need a lower dose of codeine.\\n\\nThe problem with such drugs is dependence. Which means after a while, the effect goes down so you will need to increase dose and then the effect goes down.....\\n\\nI had that experience with klonipin (clonazepam 0.5 mg). After 3 weeks, I felt that I needed more, perhaps twice the dose! I should not have taken it every day.\\n\\nStay strong!\",\n",

I am concerned that she is not being aggressive enough in my treatment, but at the same time I don't want to jump into anything too quickly. She has me taking Delzicol and then Canasa suppositories. Neither works. Aren't they pretty much one and the same? I want to question her on taking either pred suppositories or enemas instead of Canasa. These were effective for me a long time ago. This stuff can really drive you crazy.\\nHi...sorry for the late reply.  How are you doing at this point, and what meds has your doctor put you on now?\\n\\nI would strongly suggest to try the Rowasa mesalamine retention enemas and if they're not working as well as you'd like, you can support them with a foam steroid enema to use during the day.\\n\\nWhere exactly is the extent of your UC...limited or throughout?\\n\\nAre you on pred at this time?\\n\\nq\",\n",

       " {'post': \"Glad to have found this forum.  I have had UC since 1998.  I am 56 years old and otherwise in very good health.  It is my only real health issue.  It has been in remission most of the time and I get flares every 5 years or so easily controlled with medication increase (Delzicol) and/or prednisone and Canasa suppositories.  I had a very bad flare in mid-November - came out of the blue.  I was on vac in New York City.  They called in a script for prednisone.  Started with 40 mg for a week and then tapered off.  It helped control it and at the end of the taper I was probably 90% better.  Still having looser stools than usual once a day but I could live with that.  Since Christmas Eve, I started flaring again and the last few days have been the worst in terms of a flare up in my life.  I have had accident after accident, extreme urgency and incontinence and have even gone while sleeping once.  I am at my wits end and could not get into see my doctor until Jan 13.  I'm going to call again Monday, but I needed to reach out to see what suggestions/thoughts anyone here had.  My questions are:\\n1) Could this be something other than UC?  Everything i eat unless extremely bland goes right through me.  Stomach rumbles like a volcano and then it's like lava coming out uncontrollably.  Sorry to be so graphic but I'm sure it isn't totally foreign to people on this site. I wondered if I had an allergy, some type of infection?\\n2) Canasa and Delzicol are not touching this.  Are there better meds to take?  What about steroid suppositories.\\n3)  Should I be eating more fiber or taking fiber supplements to bulk up the stool?\\n4) what foods should I absolutely stay away from?\\nI am looking for some relief before I can talk to the doctor.  If anyone has had a flare like this, please tell me what you did for it and what helped you.  I feel very alone and scared.  Hard to discuss with others.  It's embarrassing and disabling at the same time.  I am wondering how I will make it to work after being off for almost 2 weeks for holiday time, which wasn't so good with this going on.  Thanks for your time - I appreciate it.\\nFor me my UC is food related.  Following the FODMAP diet may help.  There are some foods that are not on the FODMAP food list that give me problems (like corn, corn syrup is on the list but not corn, go figure). There are multiple lists and they do not agree.  You may have to eliminate a large number of items from your diet and slowly and methodically reintroduce them one by one.  Oatmeal, rice, meat, sugar are usually a safe start.  Be suspicious of all you eat and read labels for ingredients.  Keep your meals simple.   As far as medication liada is effective and targeted to the colon. It is expensive without insurance or a high deductible plan.  Also consider a medical grade probiotic like VSL #3.   For years my PA's and Gastro's told me it wasn't food related but they are slowing coming around.   When you look at the FODMAP food list some of those items may standout to you and eliminating them from your diet may offer some relief but it can take a while to get it under control.  Hang in there.\\n\\nThanks for your reply.  I will google FODMAP.  I was also told to eat low residue diet.  Maybe it's similar?  I think each flare gets worse and more complicated as I get older, and I think you are correct in saying that food plays a bigger part than previously thought.  Thanks for the support!\\nI too have UC and currently in a flare. I have been on imuran and Remicade for the past three years.  That combination has worked until just recently.  I refuse to take prednisone anymore as I don't like side effects.\\nYou might want to consider Remicade.\\nDid the Remicade and Imuran cause you any side effects or problems?  what is your next option?\\nThe remicade and imuran do have side effects.  However nothing that I can't live with.  Mostly fatigue, muscle and joint pain.  I do have a comprised immune system as is what these drugs do.    I've been on imuran for 6+ years and remicade 3years.  The combination itself can potentially cause other issues but so far I have not experienced these.\\n\\nSaw my Dr yesterday and I'm in wait and see mode\\nMy daughter is on Apriso and Remicade, and has some really bad skin issues crop up-like huge sores on her legs and a fungus on her toes. When you are on something like Remicade that messes with your immune system it causes you to be much more susceptible to fungus related conditions.\\nGood luck, and I hope you get some good answers. We are currently researching taking wheat out of her diet-I mean-when do you stop trying ANYTHING YOU CAN, right?\",\n",

       " {'post': \"Hello everyone,\\nIm a 21 y/o male. I've been having the feeling that gas is bubbling around in what feels like my lower abdomen and possibly my bladder for about 6 months now. The feelING is especially felt when laying down. It doesn't totally hurt but it's enough to concern me. Im always hungry but ive also lost weight. My upper abdomen seems tense and bloated. The hairs around my belly are very sensitive and i feel the need to pee when i dont have to. About a year ago I really cloudy urine so I took a uralysis and came up clean. I've started eating healthier hoping the problem would just go away. Any clues as to what this might be?\\nNo idea initially, but you best see your doctor and get other testing done such as stool sampling.\\n\\nhave blood testing for hormones, liver enzymes, vitamins and kidney functioning.\\n\\nWhy do you think you're losing weight?  are you eating regular meals? and give an example of foods you're eating.\\n\\nAre you on any medications, drugs or supplements?\\n\\nq\\nThanks for the reply. Usually I start my day off with a shake consisting of egg, carrots, kale, starwberris, bluberries, yogurt, olive oil and naked mango and green machine juice.\\nI skip lunch most ofthe time just because ive been sleeping in later and mkssig the appropriate time (unemployed and depressed). But i fill in he gap with a lot of snacking.\\nDinners can range, as its usually what my mom makes but ive started t turn away from meat. I dont drink pop or alcohol and dont use drugs.\\nIve noticed what feels like a strong heartbeat just below my belly button.\\nMy bowel movemnts are regular and easy going.\\nIm concerned as to why my pee was so very murky for just about a year and now its fine. Could i have been peeing out the linig of my bladder all that time?\\nHi..how long have you been having the shakes for brunch?\\n\\nWhat's your reason for not eating meat?\\n\\nAre you drinking an average amount of water during the day?\\n\\nSome veggies can make urine cloudy..... by murky, do you mean dark and cloudy?   One possibility for that is you might have had a mild infection, irritation or even small stones and have finally peed them out.  You don't pee out the lining, but the lining does have mucus that can be increased from irritation or inflammation.\\nIf you increased your fluid intake, that could have helped as well.\\n\\nq\",\n",

So far it has been a stressful 2014 and at the start of 2015 there was some good news,but the problem is still there.\\nLet me just start that I started to get anxiety and also physical symptoms of anxiety after quitting tobacco smoking this was back in October 2013 and have been smoke free ever since.\\n\\nI have every test done possible which ruled out the anxiety,but there was something they caught back in 2014. They caught a fatty liver in the ultrasound, they were originally checking for gallbladder, i originally came in due to complaints of RUQ pain just below the right lower rib cage area.\\nOk so during after the diagnosis, I became depressed so what I did was do some changes, exercise, eat healthy. Came back for a second ultrasound\\nit showed no fatty liver, bile ducts, gallbladder all appear normal same as my pancreas and kidneys.\\nPain is still there and has dramatically gotten worst,but still tolerable.\\nI had my pcp feel around the area of pain and he's pointed thats your large intestine/colon area. The pain is tender and can be quite stingy that radiates all around that RUQ and RLQ area.\\nI can start my day with a flat stomach,but drinking water, or eating something small can cause a small bloating but eating a full meal will make me look like I am pregnant even though I am a guy. I am not obese,but a bit overweight just 10lbs over my ideal weight.\\nI do feel tired all the time,but I have never experience any type of vomiting, fever, chills only some nausea, cloudy feeling, depression, palpitations which is probably my anxiety kicking in. I do get acid re flux but on rare occasions.\\nNot to sound disgusting,but my stools are random, it can be loose, watery colors can vary from being dark brown, green, brown but at times its normal or it can be little tiny drops. Just recently I feel I'm not emptying my bowels and also urinating a lot. I'm due for some blood work to see if I have any issues with my colon and my pcp will consider a colonscopy and sleep study since I snore and choke during sleep witnessed by my wife.\\nI'm only 30, I miss being healthy and worry free. I miss doing stuff\\nand actually feel great going out. I enjoy driving around, taking trips now I feel I like I can't enjoy that stuff. I never thought in my life will ever join a health forum.\\nNow I feel cloudy, disconnected, always worrying, I want to enjoy my kids.\\nLife throws lemons, its not fair where other people abuse the heck out of their bodies yet nothing is wrong with them and I know a lot of people like that close to me ranging from friends, family etc.\",\n",

       " {'post': \"For about a month I was seeing blood after a bowel movement and wiping. My stool was a normal color, but there was a little mucus. This was brought up to my doctor during a physical for school when she asked me questions about me stool. She asked me to keep a close eye on the situation and prescribed a stool softener and metamucil. I protested saying that I didn't think that I needed a stool softener but she insisted. That same day (Monday) I received the flu nasal spray, PPD, varicella, and Tdap vaccines. That next day I had an upper respiratory cold that lasted the next four days. And two days after having the vaccines (Wednesday) I started using the stool softeners and metamucil as prescribed. Sunday night I had what was beginnging to be constipation and horrible stomach aches. I emailed my doctor the next day and she advised me to lower the dosage of the metamucil.\\nIt is now the next Saturday. For days I had horrible stomach aches. With the items I was prescribed I also took 2 different gentle laxatives 3 separate times. They did help with the constipation, but today has been the worst of all. I had a stomach ache so bad that I almost threw up and felt very fatigued afterwards.\\nYesterday I did start an antibiotic for a UTI. I have looked up the side effects for what was prescribed to me and I do not feel that it is what has made my stomach make another turn for the worst today.\\nThe main reason why I wrote this post is because I am at my wits end with these stomach aches and the constipation. Plus i'm seeing a lot of yellow mucus now and I know that is not normal. Basically that was what my last last bowel movement was only consisted of.\\nWhen my doctor initially discussed the blood and bowel movements she mentioned crohn's disease.\\nI don't understand why I am constipated as well. I eat plenty of fiber and exercise. Plus I drink lots of water.\\nI will be trying to get a same day appointment on Monday with my physician. Any advice would be great if I do have something like crohn's. I'm ready to get rid of this mess!\\nHi...it's a difficult place for you to be in when you're suffering and your doctor isn't doing anything to get you the testing you need to give insight as to what's going on.\\n\\nAre you still seeing blood after bms?\\n\\nIs the blood mixed up in the stool, or just after you wipe?\\n\\nWho gave you the antibiotic for the UTI?   While you're on it, I'd suggest you take a probiotic.  What antibiotic are you using and when is the timing of it?\\n\\nWhat Metamucil formulation exactly are you using, and when?\\n\\nyou should email your doctor again and request that she send you for some tests at the very least.  She should have you do stool testing to rule out an invader in the stool, and it could reveal blood IN the stool...which will give insight whether or not you possibly have bleeding in the colon or not.\\n\\nShe should also be sending you to a specialist to do a colonoscopy at the very least.\\n\\nhang tough...I've been in limbo with symptoms and my doctor saying it's only hemorrhoids when bleeding started after almost 3 years of diarrhea.  She finally sent me to a GI who diagnosed me with Ulcerative Colitis (which was a relief to know).\\n\\nBe proactive and insistent.  If she's going to send you for a barium enema, pass on it and push for a colonoscopy...the barium enema testing I had showed absolutely nothing of the obvious inflammation and bleeding in my rectum and sigmoid.  It was a waste of valuable time and one of the worst tests I've had.\\n\\nq\\nHi Quincy,\\nThank you for replying.\\nI stopped seeing blood when wiping about a day or two before I started the stool softener and Metamucil. It only happened when wiping. I've also beeing having mucus in my stool. Sorry lol, I know it's tmi\\nThe UTI antibiotic was prescribed by the same physician that I spoke to for my physical. I have actually been taking a probiotic for the past month before this all started. I didn’t start taking it for any of these reasons since it was before all this came up. I just did it to be healthy.\\nThe Metamucil formulation is 5.4 GM individual packs.\\nI am definitely calling my doctor’s office on Monday and will try to go in the day and will demand that it needs to be looked further into.\\nShe has mentioned that she will send me to a gastro specialist so I will most likely start with that.\\nI will definitely pass on the enema. Thank you for the advice!\\nHi...while it is possible you have hemorrhoids or even a fissure (considering it's only after a bm and when wiping), it should be fully checked by a gastroenterologist rather than assuming.  So that would be a good next move.\\n\\nMucus usually shows that the colon is in a bit of more active state, either from IBS or inflammation or even hemmies.\\n\\nThere are so many formulations of probiotics...always trial and error.\\nI take mine at bedtime about an hour or two after my meds.  They are enteric coated (Primadophilus Reuteri capsules and Renew Life 50 Billion) capsules...one of each and when I'm flaring I increase them to two of each.\\n\\nAre  the Metamucil packets sugar-free? Sometimes for some people...the artificial sweeteners can cause irritation/gas and discomfort/increased activity in the colon.  I find that the capsules are best for me...I take with meals only and I can take them with when I'm out for eats.\\n\\nKeep me posted if you don't mind as to how you're doing.\\n\\nq\\n\\nJust an update. I went and saw my primary yesterday. We discussed my symptoms. An infection has been ruled out. She noticed that the corners of my mouth were cracked so she had me do blood testing for celiac and b12 levels.\\nI also had an abdominal xray just to make sure it wasn't something else. She emailed me back saying that of coarse I am very constipated as she also said when she was pressing around my colon. Most of all she thinks this is from stress. Which could be absolutely true. However is makes me wonder a little that it's not from stress since this has never happened in the past. And i've been in a lot more stress than I am in now.\\nAlso as stated before I drink plenty of water and eat great amounts of fiber. I go on atleast 1 long walk a day with my dog and I also practice yoga atleast 4-5 times a week.\\nWe have made a few adjustments to my treatment so hopefully things will start looking up.\\nThe metamucil is sugar free. And she also asked me to change to align instead of the probiotic I was already using. In a few days I will post another update.\\nThank you for your insight. I really do appreciate it.\\n\\n\\nHi...thanks for the update.\\nGood infection is ruled out.\\n\\nI do hope things even out for you with the continued changes...and while stress can definitely cause constipation, adding fruits and veggies can help keep stool from compacting too much.\\nSubjectively, of course...depending on what you find agrees with you.\\n\\nI suspect you have a fissure...if you do get bleeding from the same type of situation, you should just take a look-see yourself by squatting over a mirror and see if there's a cut around the anus.\\nShould it happen again, don't ignore that aspect of it...it should be treated as well with a topical ointment.\\n\\nlooking forward to your update,\\nq\",\n",

I cannot relax and i cannot think of anything positive.\\n\\nI'm in the same boat, good thing I found a really good doctor who finally understands me only difference from my symptom from yours is I don't have bloody or pale stools,but they are loose, watery and at times normal looking. Do you have some type of tender pain below the right side rib area? I was also tested for celiac and h.pylori,but all negative.\\nPale stools can relate more to liver or gallbladder most common is gallbladder problems.

Since you dint get bloody diarrhea, or mucus in your stool, which would indicate IBD, and other disorders. Your mebeverive is for IBS, STRESS is the biggest trigger for IBS symptoms. Furthermore its the act of holding your bowels(when its time to go) that will eventually develop into IBS symptoms. Infections can also lead to acute, but not chronic ibs(it will eventually resolve it self). Putting yourself under stress makes your ibs worst, please take some time off from work, 12hr per day is extremely stressful, because you wont have time to relax at all. You might want to speak with gastroenterologist, about your stool, could be sign of galbladder,pancreas, or liver disorders.\\nthere would also be other symptoms, like mouth ulcers.\",\n",

I looked it up on the internet and was surprised to see that virtually all of my symptoms are described!  It is hard for me to believe that none (and I have 7) of my doctors ever mentioned this before.  I'm now on antibiotic/probiotic treatment but am looking into some diets which may help manage long term as I do not want to stay on antibiotics.  If you have any experience with SIBO and what worked for you please let me know.  Thanks!\",\n",

Mild tenderness in lower left abdomen.\\n2. Going to the toilet once or twice per day, mixture of runny and normal stools.\\n3. Bright red blood and mucus in toilet, with the occasional darker blood on stool.\\n4. Rectum quite tender too.\\n5. No weight loss although since January I have been dieting and working out a lot.\\n6. Do not feel really tired or have any other symptoms.\\n\\nI am going to the doctors next week but I was wondering if anyone could advise what this sounds like and what I should be doing to remedy it.\\n\\nSeems like it only comes every three years as this is the third time in nine year that it has happened!\\n\\nAny advise would be very much appreciated.\\n\\nThanks\\n\\nGareth\\nIt sounds like a colon inflammation that could be an inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohns/ulcerative colitis. Your PCP may do an anoscope exam, but you need a colonoscopy to see up further into the bowel. You should also get a CBC done to see if you are anemic from the bleeding. Was anything diagnosed the two previous times you went through this? Do you have a gastroenterologist already that you could contact? It could take awhile to get a colonoscopy scheduled, which might delay treatment, and this has already been going on for awhile. Early treatment is the goal to keep the inflammation from getting out of control. (If that is what this is) I hope the Dr you are seeing IS a GI Dr. so you don't have to wait for a referral, appointment, etc.\\n\\nHello,\\n\\nThank you for your reply and advise, I have made an appointment to see my GP this week.\\n\\nOn the previous two occasions I have ignored it (stupidly) as it cleared up.\\n\\nIs there anything that I can eat (or avoid eating), or anything that I can take which would ease this condition- if it is an inflammatory bowel condition?\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nGareth.\\n\\nHi,\\n\\nThanks for your suggestions, to be honest I take a caffeine dietary supplement (Grenade) and have Whey protein on a daily basis as well as drinking mile and coffee...I will cut these out though.\\n\\nHow comes this condition h only has flare ups in three year intervals when I eat/rink caffeine and dairy products consistently?\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nGareth.\\nI would also avoid roughage, like salads, raw veges, nuts and high fiber foods. I would stick to soft, bland uniformly textured foods, like soy yogurt, noodles (rice would be good), applesauce, oatmeal, and soft cooked veges like soft cooked carrots. Beans, seeds, crunchy coarse and spicy foods may aggravate this. It is interesting that is recurs in 3 year intervals. Have no idea what that would mean, but glad you are not ignoring it this time.\",\n",

I then had the botox injection to heal the fissure (during which the doctor found 4) and because the area was numbed for days afterwards, I could not feel how hard I was straining to go to the bathroom and I developed a new hemorrhoid.\\n\\nToday I am certain that same hemorrhoid turned into a skin tag which I have had for months now. The same doctor who performed the botox injection suggested I could have crohns because of all the fissures I had before. I did some research and think I could have perianal crohns. Most of my symptoms match up. I also have had very bad heartburn for years as well as constipation which I wonder could be a symptom as well. I take stool softeners everyday and have tried everything, (I am gluten-free and vegan for years) but still every time I go to the bathroom I am in excruciating pain.\\n\\nI spend my summer in Colorado in the mountains and I think the altitude makes the pain worse. I recently ended up in the emergency room (my second visit just for fissure/hemorrhoid pain) because the pain after going to the bathroom was just too bad. They gave me a prescription for the pain killer norco to take after I go to the bathroom because the pain is too horrendous. That helps but constipates you which is even worse for fissures/hemorrhoids/skin tags. I do not know what to do, after I go I cannot move for hours, the pain lasts for as long as 14 hours.\\n\\nI have tried everything, and have had chronic pain for 6 years now and just want to figure out a diagnoses. Every doctor has told me something different, I know crohns is difficult to diagnose, but I feel like this could be it.\\n\\nCan anyone help me figure out what this is and if it does indeed sound like perianal crohns? I cant take it anymore\\n\\n\\nThank you!!!',\n",

I've had maybe 2 or 3 pancreatitis attacks, or at least what I believe to be attacks, and a few UC flairs. Otherwise, I've felt completely fine and normal since I was diagnosed with my diseases, and haven't experienced any symptoms for quite a long time.\\n\\nOver the past few years, I've been seeing a gastroenterologist and have been getting blood work every 6 months. It seems that my liver enzyme levels have been fluctuating between normal and elevated every other time I've gotten blood work, with my most recent test showing elevated levels. It has really gotten me depressed lately, and makes me question if my medicine will continue to work for me, or if I'll have to risk taking something else that may not prevent all of my symptoms from showing up like my current medication does.

Before she lost her job she was getting regular Remicaid treatments and I\\'m guessing other medicine; not quite sure but I do know for sure she was getting Remicaid.\\n\\nShe has had no appetite for a few months, and has slowly but steadily been losing weight. During the last two weeks she became very sick - always with stomach cramps, nausea, and if she ate anything she would throw it up. In Sept she was about 200 and she is currently 158.\\n\\nShe FINALLY went to the doctor two days ago and they gave her medicine including an anti-inflammatory. She has an anal fistula and has consultation for surgery in about 2 weeks. They tested her stool for other infections but it came back negative.\\n\\nWe are just lost on how to help her. We are terrified for her because she is losing SO much weight and hasn\\'t been eating and sometimes falters when she walks because she is so weak. She just got the pills two days ago and said that she is feeling a little better - still cramping all day but she actually ate breakfast without throwing up. The doctor said it will be a slow recovery period. She was approved for Johnson and Johnson\\'s program where they send your doctor free Remicaid if you qualify, but she will not be able to get a treatment until she has the surgery.\\n\\nI\\'m just wondering if there is anything we are missing here - is she just having so much trouble with the constant nausea and cramping because her colitis is going untreated? Is there some medication we should be asking her doctor for that she might not be getting? Do you have any recommendations for things she can eat that will be maximum calories and not upset her stomach? We need her to get stronger so she can be in good enough health to actually get a Remicaid treatment. I just don\\'t know enough of what\\'s currently going on with her body and what she needs, and it doesn\\'t help that I am out of state.\\nHI........well my son has ulcerative colitis and it sounds like your mom is in a huge flare of the disease......and especially being she wasn\\'t on meds to control it, it probably just got to far. You mom should be in the hospital for her flare.....and given saline to hydrate her, and then probably be given prednisone through infusion to help calm the colon down. If your mom got hydration and steroids (the prednisone) she might notice a huge relief fairly quickly.....not overnight, but soon. Can you find a hospital that takes people with no insurance? Try calling around to different hospitals and find out.  For sure your mom needs hospital care. The fistula itself could be awful, so for sure your mom needs immediate care. Has she had blood work lately? Have they checked her \"sed rate\" or \"crp\"?..........thee are both inflammation markers......if they highly elevated it will show. When my son is in a flare, he loses weight quickly because of not eating and diarrhea. Dehydration can occur quickly in people who are flaring with Colitis. Please get your mom into an ER as soon as possible. What kind of doctor did she go to? what pills did he give her? if her flare is too far gone she for sure needs to be in the hospital to get it under control.......the hydration alone they automatically do in the hospital will make your mom feel better......if she has blood in her stools, they might even give iron infusions.....and most likely like I mentioned, the infused steroids. Remember call around and see if any hospital will take your mom with no insurance. Do you have a City Of Hope in your area? Don\\'t wait.....your mom needs relief ASAP. Please write here in how she is doing.\\nHi it\\'s me again.....I forgot to mention in my post above that for maximum calories/vitamins......your mom should be drinking Ensures.......she might need \"bowel rest\" which means no foods passing through her colon.....BUT ONLY A DOCTOR CAN TELL HER THAT!! In the meantime though, she needs some Ensures to drink to keep the calories high!!! and hopefully she can hold that down.  Also I read you are out of state from her.

       " {'post': \"I have had loose bowel movement for the last 4 months.  I had thought is was due to my gall bladder removal years ago.  When they roved my gall bladder I was given this powder to mix into water to help with the diaherrea and I thought I was having the same problem.  Finally got into see the gastroenterologist and was tole the pain I was experiencing was not from that anymore.  He thinks it could be an ibd, colitis.  I went in for an endoscopy to see whynimwas having tenderness in my stomach and was diagnosed with a hiatal hernia and gastritis.  He gave me a antacid along with a probiotic to help with the diaherrea. I'm now scheduled to have a colonoscopy. He still believes this is colitis and will confirm once he sees the intestines.\\n\\nI've never had one of these procedures before.  I'm nervous to find out what is causing this problem.  If this is colitis, what kind of mediations do they give and how do people cope with this disease. As it is anything I eat goes right through me almost instantly, so going out or anything is uncomfortable especially if there is dinner involved.  At times even water sets this condition off.  Is colitis hereditary?\\n\\nIf its not colitis what cold this be?\\n\\nAny information or advice is greatly appreciated.\\nHi Valis, my son was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis at age 15 and he is 22 now. His symptoms were blood and diarrhea. A colonoscopy with biopsy confirmed this. Don't worry about the colonoscopy.....it's a breeze....I just had my first one and I was petrified, but it was an easy thing to go through. As for my son, we have yet to find a medicine to work on him, so after 7 years of him being sick, he is thinking about surgery to have his colon removed. See what your doctor says.....maybe it's just IBS.  If it is indeed Ulcerative Colitis, your doctor will give you what he thinks is the best medicine for you. He might start you off on pills or a biologic......all doctors are different....some want to start with a more mild treatment, some with a stronger one.....it depends how your colon looks. please write and post what the doctor said!!  Good luck!!\\nValis....I forgot to ask you in my last reply to you......How old are you? I am in my 50's and in peri-menopause and have many digestive issues that come along with that......when a woman's body starts to go through the change....many digestive issues occur.......and I also myself have major anxiety and stress (due to our son having colitis) and if for whatever reason you have stress and anxiety in your life that can cause stomach distress and diarrhea.....just wanted to mention that. As for going out, yes, it's hard when my son is in a flare, he does not want to venture out.  Did the doc say you can take something for the diarrhea besides a probiotic?\",\n",

I get bright red blood on toilet tissue and streaks on the stool. In addition the colonoscopy sometimes shows mild inflammation on the right sided cecum and in lower part of my bowel – (patchy and mild inflammation) with no urgency or diarrhoea.\\n\\nWhat I want to investigate is whether this patchy inflammation is IBD or something different given my very mild symptons, whether the current bright red bleeding is my haemorrhoids or something else more sinister - I do not have any other symptoms apart from an sore bum.\\n\\nI feel totally fine, except for the bright red blood on stool and on tissue which now comes on occasions after a disappearance of some 4 years!\\n\\nIs this complex investigation something you peeps can help me with?

I have a lot of bloating sometimes, which can be painful. Anyway, she had me do a blood test and stool sample which both came back perfectly normal.

My recommendation would be to contact the local chapter of the Crohn\\'s /Colitis support group and get a recommendation from them.  It is important that your gastro specializes in treating such a disease.  So a conclusive diagnosis can be reached.\\nHi...blood tests and stool samples done initially by your GP are a good idea to make sure nothing obvious (such as infection) is going on.\\n\\nYour symptoms could initially fit into the criteria of inflammatory bowel disease, but the only way one will know is for your doctor to refer you to a Gastroenterologist.  He/she should then put you through testing series of elimination, which would include a possible initial look-see with a rectoscope, maybe some swab testing done and probably more stool samples.\\n\\nI encourage to push for a colonoscopy with biopsies rather than only a sigmoidoscopy (limited only as far as past the sigmoid and maybe to the transverse).  You need to know what\\'s going on throughout your full colon since there can be some inflammation above where a sig-scope can venture.\\n\\nIt takes time for the process....and while it\\'s possible you have an IBD, there are possibilities for it to be something else where symptoms can be the same.\\n\\nHang tough....do the research for proper testing.\\nDO the c-scope first (my GP at the time had me do a barium enema...which didn\\'t even show the 15 inches of bleeding/inflammation from rectum to sigmoid....that was a waste of my time, let alone an undignified test to start).\\n\\nAsk questions here, formulate your own for your appointments and make sure you get copies of any testing results you\\'ve had done to this point (which includes the recent bloods and stool) for your research and knowledge base.\\n\\nLet us know what\\'s happening for sure.\\n\\nq',\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi everyone,\\n\\nI went to see the GI specialist today and given I have a slow bowel, I think they think it's not only more cost effective but probably more helpful if I swallow a pill cam. I'm showing thickening in the midsection of my bowel and the doctor's first suspicion is Crohn's, but it's not a diagnosis since he can't 'see'.\\n\\nI first have to swallow a different type of capsule to ensure my bowel can take the pill cam. If the first one doesn't pass easily, it will simply break up. But they're out of stock, so they'll call me when they get it in.\\n\\nAnyway, I've been under suspicion for a while I may have Crohn's, despite the lack of diarrhea which tends to be typical in many Crohn's sufferer's symtoms. I'm not worried about the diagnosis. I just want an answer because then I can look at treating whatever ails me - as I'm sure many would understand.\\n\\nHas anyone had the pill cam for diagnosis?\\nyes....i had pill cam for ulcers and to locate a small bleeding fissure in the intestinal wall....has no problems....the hardest part is fasting....and swallowing the dang thing! it's about the size of a large vitamin but HATE taking pills due to gag reflex so that was a pain .....  no worries tho, you s/b fine  !\\n\\nHi Parker,\\nThanks for your reply. Do you also have to fast for the dummy capsule, or did you not require one? It's to make sure the pill cam will be able to pass through bowel.\\ni never had a dummy pill just rite to the good stuff.....but i promise - if i can do it ANYONE can do it!....to be fair tho, i got a big butt, so they realized the laws of physics would apply n my case !\\nMine's not small, but I think because I have thickening in my bowel, they want to make sure it passes. I just read a horror story on another forum and the poor bugger came out way worse off than when he started. Granted, it might have happened anyway. I won't elaborate because it's pretty shocking.\\nHave you made sure that the pill cam is covered by your insurance? My insurance would not cover it. My gastro pushed for it for investigative purposes but my insurance said because of strictures it may necessitate surgery so they would not agree to the pill cam that would break up. Sux because I wanted to try it.\\n\\nI haven't had the procedure yet for that very reason. We're waiting to find out that it's medically necessary. Why else would someone swallow a camera? For fun? I think because of where my issues are, they're figuring this is the least invasive way and probably safer, if the dummy pill is successful first. Thickening in the intestine is the concern about whether I can take the pill cam itself. What you said about the strictures might be why it's taking so long for me to hear back. Perhaps they might be getting turned down and I might end up with a rather long endoscope - it's the mid section of my small bowel, I think, that they have to explore. Not so easy to get to.\\nIt did take a while for a response from my insurance, too. When my GI got ahold of them they said it was a no go. About 6 months later I had surgery where 6 inches of my ileum was removed.\\nI really wanted to try the pill cam. For fun! really. Im a weirdo like that. After having Cd for this long I need some new things. wink.\\nTake care.\\nYou wanted to experience a new test. I understand and it's not weird. It's just an experience. How long was the recovery time for removal of part of your ileum? Six weeks, or longer? I know the bowel goes to sleep when touched, so when resected, I imagine it's real grumpy when it's waking up.\\nWell this was the worst recovery of all maybe 9, 10 surgeries. It was a big one that I had put off for 3-4 years. All I have is small intestine. Large was removed at age 10. Of my small theres about 2 feet removed off the very end. This time there was a few pieces of what my surgeon referred to as gnarly, fistulatized, and strictured. Every two weeks for 2 years I had bowel obstructions which ended up with me in horrible pain and vomiting. No fun. Seriously I would throw up and think when did I eat that? Food would back up for about 4 days but the liquids got through. This surgery was in November of 2013 and it really took me to February to get back to almost normal. I also was sick with a cold that slowly progressed to asthmatic bronchitis by February. During the surgery and recovery I went thru 3 picc lines and did tpn at home through the picc. One night my arm just ached so bad and started running a fever and I called my surgeon. He said it should be pulled because an infection was starting. My nurse came out at 3am and pulled it. A weird thing after my latest surgery was bad gas in my abdomen. It made me burp loud, seeminly neverending man burps. Not pretty.\\nSo it is really odd that you do not have diarrhea but they suspect you may have Crohns. Although they also say that Crohns is hereditary but not in my case. They also say a symptom of a flare is a fever. Rarely do I run a fever.\\nTheres no way really to see the mid section of the intestinal tract either. The endoscopy goes down through the stomach and a little into the duodenum if I remember correctly. The colonoscopy goes maybe 4 or 5 feet up from the bottom. Have you done barium tests? That would show cobblestoning, a pattern that shows up in Crohns. Its like an old cobblestone street design.\\nWow. You've been through the works! How are you doing now?\\n\\nI had the dummy pill last week, but it git stuck in my small intestine, so I can't have the pill cam - I'm not a viable candidate due to the thickening in my intestine. (I'm glad we did a dummy run first!) I'm assuming a double balloon endoscopy is the next step. They mentioned an endoscope when I was in hospital, but I would have to go to Kansas City because they don't have a scope long enough in this town. I'm guessing they think they can reach.\\n\\nI had barium a study done and CT with contrast. The CT mentioned enhanced mucosal lining, I think and thickening in small bowel (not sure which part), inflammation higher up and telescoping or intussusception (Sp?) further down. the barium study was over within 3.5 hours, so it was fairly quick - well in contrast with what I was expecting. I obviously don't have a lazy bowel, but rather a lazy colon! I just see test results for latest blood work (just BC) have come back. Going to check.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Any help here would be greatly appreciated...\\n\\nI am a 26 year old woman who has been constipated my entire life to the point that I was placed on Milk of Magnesia as a child to ease my anal tearing. As an adult, I am very used to not going to the bathroom often, sometimes once every 2 weeks. I have always had a dull ache in my lower abdomen, most predominately in the right side.\\n\\nIn January, I cut gluten out of my diet in order to lose weight. At that time, I weighed 253 pounds. I began losing weight but became sick and needed 3 rounds of antibiotics shortly after. At the beginning of April, everything changed and I started experiencing severe diarrhea upwards of 10 times a day. At this point, I stopped trying to lose weight but have inevitably kept dropping pounds. I was referred to a GI who put me back on gluten 2 weeks ago. I continue to lose weight and am currently 201 pounds.\\n\\nThe pain I\\'m experiencing is excruciating and my bloat is not pleasant. As of yesterday, I\\'m leaking blood from my bottom. When I pass wind, I leave a mist of blood. When I use the washroom, the water in the toilet turns pink. I am used to bleeding from tearing, but there is NO anal pain with this new bleeding. It\\'s just there. The pain I feel right now is on the right side of my belly button. I went to the ER yesterday and my blood tests came back normal. I\\'m waiting on a date to have a scope performed. My eyes have also been wrecking havoc. They are so dry and painful that I\\'m becoming quite embarrassed about the amount of blinking I do and no, eye drops don\\'t help.\\n\\nMy question to everyone is what you do or use to make the pain and bloating stop? Tylenol and Advil aren\\'t doing anything and I\\'m at my wits end. I have no idea where to go from here.\\n\\nAdd: My grandmother had Crohn\\'s and died from colon cancer and I have several cousins diagnosed with Celiac.\\nThe only way you\\'d know is to have a referral to a gastroenterologist and get thoroughly checked out.\\n\\nHave you taken a look to see if you have a fissure (not all hurt while having a bm).  You could possibly have a hemorrhoid that\\'s decided to bleed.\\n\\nI\\'m curious what you do eat and drink on a daily basis...some foods can cause more gas and extreme discomfort.  As well...what supplements do you take?\\n\\nAre you regular with your periods?  Sometimes hormonal changes can cause gastro issues.\\n\\nHang tough...it\\'ll be a process for you to get it all sorted.  It\\'s good you\\'re having a scope done...is that a colonoscopy?  But you should first get in with your GP, ask for stool sample test kit, and ask the doc to take a look at your anus to see if you do have hemmies or a fissure that\\'s bleeding.\\n\\nRegarding your eyes...what drops have you been using?  The weather pretty much everywhere has caused many problems for breathing, eyes, etc.\\nThe other suggestion is to see an optometrist who will check out your eyes and see if anything else is going on.\\n\\nq\\nHi Quincy, my GI has checked for hemies and a fissure but can\\'t see anything with her naked eye. I\\'m sure I have a fissure farther up my track somewhere because of the years of constipation and tearing. My periods are extremely irregular since the diarrhea has started. As for what I eat, I\\'ve cut back on certain fruits and veggies which have caused me to bloat previously, but my bloat seems to occur sporadically, even on an empty stomach. I do not eat refined sugar and try to stay away from processed foods. It feels like everything starts up while I\\'m sleeping and when I wake up in the morning, the pain and bloat are fierce. It then seems to lessen in the evening if I\\'m not in a state of \"attack\". As for supplements, I\\'m anemic and take a vitamin with iron every day. I was on iron pills for a while but I found those to be too constipating and previous to that, I received iron injections every two weeks.\\nAdd:\\n\\nI\\'ve had over 10 stool samples since April and have been treated for parasites and c. diff, neither of which alleviated my symptoms. My optometrist noted that I\\'ve developed Presbyopia swelling, and dry eye and I have new glasses but my eyes have not improved.\\nHi...you have a lot of stuff to deal with at one time...and it\\'s very difficult to get things sorted.\\n\\nWhat meds are you on right now?\\n\\nIt\\'s good you do have a GI...how long have you had her?  It\\'s good you\\'re being set up for a c-scope.  That should show if anything\\'s going on.  Hopefully she\\'ll take biopsies throughout even if things look good visibly.  One thing that it could be is Microscopic Colitis (either Lymphocytic or Collagenous).\\n\\nRegarding your vision, meds can sometimes cause changes in vision. The other thing is possible autoimmune such as Sjogren\\'s.\\n\\nDo you have the results of all your blood tests?  Has anything been out of whack regarding liver function tests?  Sometimes that can lead to possible diagnosis.\\n\\nHope your c-scope is soon.\\n\\nq',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hello everyone. I\\'m posting this on behalf of my cousin who is 21 years and suffering from what appears to be Crohn\\'s disease.\\n\\nThe quick story is that she was diagnosed about 3 years ago with ulcerative colitis, but saw little improvement. About 4 months ago it got so worse that she had to do surgery to remove most of the colon. During the operation they did a biopsy and it turned out actually it was Crohn\\'s disease (I\\'m no doctor, but based on her symptoms I was suspecting Crohn\\'s disease all the time). Now she\\'s hoping to do a second operation and reconnect the colon, but the rectum appears very irritated. The doctor prescribed Mesalasine and Asacol, but from what I\\'m reading they are used to treat Ulcerative Colitis. Also after surgery the doctor told her \"don\\'t worry\" Crohn and Ulcerative Colitis have the same medication, so it was no big deal that you got Ulcerative Colitis meds.\\n\\nNow, from what I\\'m reading although the symptoms are similar, the meds are quite different. Can anyone please shed some light on this, because I suspect the doctors are just telling a lot of ******** to \"protect\" themselves and not accept that she got the wrong meds.\\n\\nThank you',\n",

       " {'post': \"I probably wouldn't post here normally since I have lymphocytic colitis, but figured that many of you would have experience since Entocort is often used for Crohn's.\\n\\nI was wondering if this is normal for a taper from entocort.\\n\\nWhile I was on entocort (began in Jan), I felt relatively normal.  I spoke very fast and talked a lot.  I also had insomnia as in, I never felt tired.  Also, we have a vehicle that rides very high and I did not like riding in this at all as it felt like a roller coaster which I am not fond of....and I got very jumpy with traffic.     Oh...and I gained weight and at an appointment with my endo for my thyroid, my blood pressure, which was always very low, was very high.  Otherwise, I felt relatively normal and certainly felt a lot better.  Before taking it, I was REALLY tired and just had constant nausea, pain, and diarrhea.\\n\\nI've been tapering since mid May.  I didn't have a difficult time until I went to one pill a day.  Two days ago, I dropped to none.\\nI have been VERY emotional.  I am not a big crier, but I've had many episodes of heavy, body shaking crying fits. I'm also irritable.  I feel highly unstable, but at the same time, there is a part of me that knows this is due to medication fluctuation.  I am tempted to have rather depressive thoughts, but I don't carry things out because there is still some sense in my head.    It is really embarrassing.  Thankfully, I have wonderful family and dh who will sit with me and tell me how he loves me and how everything is ok.   Before this, I've been very happy with life, etc.  I am really tired.  And the past week, I've become so very sore.  Also, I have asthma and it seems to be flaring quite a bit.  I've also had really terrible headaches.  Oh, and I get very flushed and sweat periodically...which happened when I first went on, but this seems different.\\n\\nI've read a lot where people say that they never had anything negative with entocort.  I also have read that it is very mild compared to other steroids since it is only released in the gut.\\n\\nMaybe I just don't know what a taper is like after long term steroid.  I have only been on oral steroids once before for about 2 wks (during which I could barely function) for my asthma.  I think it was methylprednisone.  I also take inhaled steroid and flonase.\",\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi, I am 34 and have stomach issues for many years. I have had 3 colonoscopys and 2 endoscopys. my most recent one was less than a yr ago. It showed mild diffuse gastritis and a hiatal hernia. My stomach issues range. Usually have several bms a day and feel nauseated alot. I get lots of bloating and stomach rumbling. I tested negative for celiac but gonna go gluten free to see if it helps. My question is, I had a ct scan of my abdomen and it shows prominent fluid filled small bowel loop seen in the left lower to mid abdomen with normal appearance of the remaining bowel smd no evidence of obstruction. potential etiologies include gastroenteritis. I am confused because I wasnt having vomiting at the time....I was in the e.r 3 weeks prior with a stomach bug (i think)....I have been told all my biopsys are normal , no chrons or anything but she wants to treat the inflamation with a chrons med????? I have been diagnosed with ibs only thus far. I am so confused. I dont ever have blood in my stool or anything. is this chrons , should I see another doctor. any advice would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\nEven though you tested negative for celiac, many people have gluten allergy or intolerance without celiac disease that improves greatly on a gluten free diet. I am one of those myself. I could tell within a week of going gluten free that it was helping, and for sure within a month. Not everyone responds that fast but I think it would make sense to try. Where is your Dr, thinking the inflammation is, in the fluid filled loop? If you can hold off on the meds until you try the diet, that may be a reasonable approach. I guess it all depends on how sick you feel. If you do the diet change and the meds both at same time, it will be confusing as to which is helping if you respond well.\\n\\nThank you! I was thinking the same thing! try the diet first. I got everything at the store to start it after this weekend. gonna be difficult at first. I am not really sure what gastroenteritis means.....She said inflammation. So I guess she thinks in the fluid filled loop, whatever that means! So confusing reading those reports! It also states that I have an appendicoloth and she said I will most likley get appendicitis because inflammation was also seen on the tip. ugh! I am so scared I might have ibd instead of ibs. I appreciate your response so much!\\n\\nWith the appendix stone, it is important to be familiar with location of pain and symptoms of appendicitis, so you don't ignore those thinking it is IBS or IBD pain. If your usual pain is more central or around belly button, it will be easier to tell if RLQ pain from appendicitis starts up. If you have RLQ pain with the GI problem, you could even consider getting appendix taken out on an elective, scheduled basis when convenient, rather than risk an acute appendicitis occurring and having confusion about diagnosis. I hope the gluten elimination works to quiet down the inflammation. Did you have blood work done that included a sed rate or CRP (inflammatory markers)? The small bowel forms loops, but is usually not fluid filled, so that apparently is the site of inflammation. Gastroenteritis just means inflammation or infection of stomach, intestines, usually caused by viruses. Another test that can be helpful to rule out Crohn's is a small bowel follow thru xray, which shows up the mucosa or lining of the small bowel well.\\nHi, Thank you. I do get lots of right sided pain. I am switching insurance at the moment so I am gonna see a surgeon soon about that issue. I had a normal crp a few months back and I had a negative ana test also.I will get the small bowel x-ray. I thought colonoscopy was the gold standard for diagnosing this?I feel very aloneand scared right now but gonna keep my head up till I have a definate answer. Thanks for your help.feeling a bit better now.\\n\\nThe small bowel follow-thru is an older test, but may be helpful for Crohn's and celiac, especially if the problem is higher in the small intestine than the colonoscopy can reach. You can have celiac disease with negative antibodies in serum. Nothing in medicine ever seems to be 100%, there are always exceptions to the rule to add to the confusion. Hope you get some answers soon and it's nothing serious.\\nHi, I wanted to update. I had the test done and it sucked! Had to drink lots of barium! yummy! it took a couple hours. The result was normal!!! Why the ct showed what it did, I dont know but no inflammation showed in the follow thru. Happy about that.\\nwhere to go from here I am not sure.\\nthank you ladybud\",\n",

Going from normal to loose and sometimes watery. Spotted blood only once with normal formed stool. I dont have bad urgency for defecate.   I went to 2 doctors and they said its ibs, but one of the doctor decided to do colonoscopy. The biopsy said mildy congested mucosa in rectosigmoid junction. Everything else looks normal. I do have joint pains sometimes. I have swollen lymph nodes on neck for past 2 years.\\nI need opinions. I m confused and dont know what to do.  I m 23 years old male.\\nThank you\\nSince swelling of mucous membrane showed up on scope, I would see a GI specialist. Was a biopsy of mucosa done during colonoscopy? Your symptoms have been long standing enough and with tenesmus, joint pains and swollen nodes, you need an evaluation by a specialist for inflammatory bowel disease.\\nThank you for the reply!! Yes biopsy of mucosa was done during the colonoscopy. My doctor is gi specialist. Even after looking at the biopsy reports, he still thinks that its just an ibs. Should I get a second opinion?  According to you, does it look like crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis?\\nThanks!!\\nI would ask for a copy of the biopsy report. You can always post that if you wish. I wouldn't venture a guess. It is my understanding that IBS is a movement disorder in the peristalsis with smooth muscle spasm causing cramping, diarrhea and/or constipation. Swelling of the mucosa sounds like inflammation, and IBS should not cause blood in stools. Have you ever had the joint pain and lymph node enlargement worked up? I would see a rheum for that, and it may shed some light on the bowel disorder as well, especially if all this started at the same time.\\nHi Paul,\\n\\nThere are two terms that are different - that are often confused with each other.  IBS and IBD.  The key thing to remember is IBS = irritable... and IBD = inflammatory.\\n\\nWith Crohn's, when I was diagnosed, there were certain areas that were inflamed which, thus, ruled out Colitis.\\n\\nI'd take lady's suggestion about having the joint & lymph related stuff looked at by a separate docotor. I'd be surprised if they didn't take a wealth of blood tests as a standard routine to look for indicating factors.\\n\\nNo harm in getting a second opinion, however, I'd move forward with whatever treatment he suggests and do all the reading you can about IBS.\\n\\nHope the best for you, hope it's not Crohn's ......... It's been 14 years from my diagnosis and I'm still fine, so, try to keep calm if it is starting to get to you and just do everything you can to learn about how you can get it under control.\\n\\nRegards....\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I was diagnosed with Crohns in June. The beginning of September had a very bad flare. Went to gi and they did. Colonoscopy the next day. It showed inflammation throughout colon, put on Asacol HD and Rowasa and scheduled to go back in 2 days. When I go back they also said I had c diff (they took a sample) so they sent me to the hospital. After a few days there, improving with liquids only and Vanco and flagyl for c diff they tell me the biopsies came back showing melanosis coli and I must be abusing laxatives. I was dumbfounded. The last laxatives I uses were the ones for the colonoscopy test. They wouldn\\'t and still won\\'t believe that I have not been a long term laxative abuser. I\\'ve had 3 EGDs all showing inflammation. I need a laxative like I need a hole in my head! So they discharged me with a diagnosis of \"suspected laxative abuse\". Without me knowing they did a laxative screen there and then when I followed up with gi dr and both were negative. I am so hurt that the drs so not believe me. I have found a few places that say melanosis coli can be attributed to increases cell apoptosis and that can be def related to IBD. So my question- anyone else with an IBD have a biopsy show melanosis coli or been accused of abusing laxatives and what did you do? I don\\'t know what to do since both my laxative screens came back negative. This has consumed me since then and I\\'m so sick and anxious over it.\\n\\nThanks!\\nHello,\\n\\nI had never heard of Melanosis Coli.  I looked it up, merely a change in pigmentation and a few other features.  It did mention laxatives as a cause.  As you imply, most people with UC or Crohn\\'s can\\'t even look at laxatives on a store shelf without feeling sick.  Sometimes Crohn\\'s patients get partial or full small bowel obstructions and a very few of them will turn to laxatives with disastrous results.\\n\\nIt would be entirely okay to admit such a thing, wouldn\\'t it?  Not to imply that you have done this... but, have you felt constipated at all in the past?  Have you ever had a bowel obstruction?\\n\\nYou could share with them how their incorrect conclusions have upset you greatly and demand some sort of apology.  You can also get a new set of Doctors.  Try to let it go if you can.  Go back in a few months and get yourself retested, if the condition persists then they need to figure it out, right?\\n\\nIso~',\n",

       " {'post': 'Just trying to see if anyone knows of any successful treatments besides resection. I\\'d really like to avoid surgery.\\nHi..what was the reason that you had the resection?\\nDo you have Crohn\\'s disease?   If so, are you on any medications?\\n\\nq\\nI\\'m 41 yrs old.  The resection was at age 19, while I was pregnant.  Pathology report said \"indicative of Crohns but not conclusive\".  I had been sick during the pregnancy.  I thought it was morning sickness.  They did an exploratory surgery based on my high WBC.  Found more than a dozen granulomas and they removed about 8 inches of the ileum, through the terminal ileum about halfway through the transverse colon.  I\\'ve never had symptoms of Crohns.  I just had my 4th colonoscopy.  My first a couple years after the resection showed a couple polyps, so really that\\'s what they keep checking for.  The ilieocolonic ulcer worries me.  I know they can pop up any time after the surgery...even 22 years later.  I have an MR enterography and some IBD serology tests coming up.  I don\\'t know a lot about all of this and I\\'m just hoping to gain some knowledge before I meet with the doctor again.\\n\\nThank you for any help you can provide.\\nWow, that\\'s a big surgery and change of your gastro tract.  Especially since you had it done when you were pregnant.  It must have been a scary time.\\n\\nHave you had a lifetime of diarrhea because of the extent of intestine/colon removed?\\n\\nSince you\\'ve had polyps and I\\'m assuming they\\'ve been removed...you being monitored regularly is a good thing.  You are having all the testing possible to determine if you have CD, so all bases are being covered.\\n\\nI don\\'t know much  about it...just what I\\'ve read and am reading.  I was initially interested if you did have CD and ere on meds and if the ulcer was CD related.  I\\'m very familiar with all the meds related to IBD (CD and UC...I have UC)\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t seem that surgery is the initial treatment.....but it does depend on your symptoms and for them to be dealt with.\\n\\nI do have tons of questions, however..(as usual)\\n\\nWhere exactly is the ulcer?  is it bleeding and are you anemic?\\n\\nI would think that your first-ling possible medication to help the ulcer would be a mesalamine, if it\\'s around the resection site.  There are many options...It\\'s also thought/believed that mesalamine can help to protect the colon from cancer...which might also be a double duty help if you have polyps.  But....some polyps can be related to inflammation (pseudopolyps)..which some who have IBD have in the areas that are affected.\\n\\nIf you\\'re anemic, iron supplements or infusions would be given.\\n\\nNSAID meds must be stopped (Aspirin, Advil, Naproxin..etc).\\n\\nI think with further research, a list of questions for your doc and more testing for confirmation...it would depend on the extent of the ulcer and if it\\'s all clear regarding precancer...then treatments starting at first-line would be in your best interests if you\\'re wanting to avoid surgery.\\n\\nI also read that there\\'s a poly-type film that can also be put over the ulcer to help heal/protect it....cool stuff...\\n\\nq\\nGood morning....\\n\\nNo, I had no side effects from the right hemicolectomy.  The ulcer is at the site of the anastomosis.  I saw a picture of it.  It\\'s not bleeding.  Looks like a small blister.  I don\\'t have the results of my blood work back yet.  But I don\\'t think that I\\'m anemic.  Glad to hear that surgery is not the first line of treatment.  The stopping of the NSAID is terrible news!  What\\'s a person supposed to take for pain?  I occassionally take ibuprophen and naproxen.  Every GI doctor I\\'ve ever seen always seems hell bent on diagnosing Crohn\\'s.  But like I\\'ve said.  Other than the physical findings during the surgery and the colonoscopies I have no symptoms.  They always get frustrated at me when they say that I have it and I say \"prove it\".\\nI just don\\'t want to be treated for something that I don\\'t think that I have.  It can sometimes mean taking many many pills a day!\\nPathology report came back.  No cancer.  They say \"active colitis\".  Not sure what that means.  But anything is better than cancer right?\\n\\nHi...definitely the NO CANCER is a huge plus, and that would also mean no cellular changes in that direction.\\n\\nDid you have the polyps removed from previous scopes? ..and they came back with what pathology?\\n\\nDid the GI take biopsies throughout the area that was accessed by the c-scope?  Do you have the complete pathology report?....the reason is that each biopsy would be analysed from each section.\\nIf they report that you have active colitis with all the biopsies other than the one from the ulcer, then something\\'s going on.\\n\\nThe worst meds you can take are naproxen and advil....for body pain I\\'d suggest you try one with a muscle relaxant (methocarbamol) such as Tylenol for back pain.  I use that, and it certainly helps take the edge off.\\n\\nI suggest you request a 5ASA medication (mesalamine) which is topical.  There are few side effects unless you\\'re allergic or sensitive to it.  I\\'ve taken oral/rectal 5ASA for almost 25 years....no precancer/cancer/polyps...but I do flare, but I\\'m no where near what I\\'ve been since diagnosis.\\nIf you\\'re in the US, Apriso is a good medication since it\\'s a lower dosage with very effective dispersal method.  I know many who use it with no problems.\\nIf your inflammation isn\\'t extreme, it\\'s a good one to consider...of course, I could suggest others, but it does depend on where your sites of inflammation are, the fact that you\\'ve had the ileum removed and where the med will start to release, etc, etc, etc....\\n\\nIs there anyone in your family who has UC or CD? or any bowel issues at all?\\n\\nok, enough questions....lol.\\n\\nq',\n",

       " {'post': \"Greetings Sufferers,\\n\\nLong time Inflammatory Bowel Disease, J-Pouch.\\n\\nNew to Crohn's last year.  Fatigue and Joint Pain so bad I can hardly drag myself through the day.  My productivity is close to zero due to these symptoms.\\n\\nWhat drugs or therapies will help?\\n\\n\\nIso~\\n\\nCurrently:\\nHumira\\nImuran\\nHmmm.... No Crohn's sufferers out there with extreme Fatigue and Joint Pain?  Yikes, am I the only one?\\n\\nIso~\\nHave you been tested for nutritional deficiencies?  When the small intestine is affected in Crohn´s there is a risk of nutritional deficiencies. To name a few, iron deficiency (which can also cause anemia), or vitamin B12 deficiency. With long-running inflammatory bowel disease there may be also be a risk of bone problems (low bone density) due to low absorption of vitamin D or calcium. If you have a nutritional deficiency, supplementation should help.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the inflammation associated with Crohn´s may also directly cause fatigue and Crohn´s can be associated with a RA (rheumatoid arthritis)-like syndrome causing joint inflammation. If you have an RA-like syndrome, treatment may be different so I would certainly consult a doctor/specialist.\\n\\nIn any case, it seems likely that your symptoms can be improved with the right treatment.\\n\\n(I haven´t been diagnosed with Crohn´s but have had some GI complaints and have had nutritional deficiencies).\\nisotope, what is your diet. have you ever tried irrigation with wáter or suppositories.\\nHello Friends,\\n\\nThank you for writing.\\n\\nSince I first posted above my symptoms have spiraled into a myriad of issues.  My hair is falling out, my skin is red and flaking on my face.  Every joint aches and my bones hurt.  And of course the fatigue is just unreal.\\n\\nI'm very surprised by all of this.  I've been battling these diseases, first Ulcerative Colitis in the 80's, then J-Pouch surgery in the 90's, and now Crohn's.  I'm very accustomed to feeling bad nearly every day but my coping ability has really been tested over the last year or so.\\n\\nIn total contrast to how I feel, my monthly labs always come back normal.  I take 2,000mg Vit-D, a Multi, B-Complex, Fish Oil, Aspirin, and Pro-Biotics.\\n\\nMy diet could definitely be improved, nothing too awful but I should probably be Gluten free, or Paleo or both or something.\\n\\nMy Doctor lays no blame on Humira or Imuran and is of no help otherwise.  I'm suspicious of these drugs.  I had a very minor toe surgery last year to address a cyst.  I'm still limping today, 14 months after this surgery.  I finally sought treatment this week.  The toe is blown up, red, swollen, and the bone has remodeled and doubled in size.  The Podiatrist now wants to remove the bone entirely, suspecting a bone tumor!\\n\\nI'm worried that any further surgery will aggravate something else and cause some other issue.  My immune system is completely wrecked.\\n\\nIt feels like I'm playing in a different ball game now, the stakes keep getting higher, and my condition continues to deteriorate.  Very discouraging.\\n\\nIso~\\nIsotpe,\\n\\nI'm new to the boards hope your still checking this. Ive had crohns for 22 years had resection 15 yrs ago disease came right back and at the same time joint pain started, burning, aching like a fire in joints especially with flares no doc quite figured it out since there was no inflammation in the joint. I have been on daily pain meds since. 2 yrs ago my knee filled with fluid, had to drain now it hurts worse gets red hot and puffy after exercises.  From what docs said it can all be caused by the crohns disease.  So sorry you have to go thru this. Talk to the docs about pain management but don't let them give steriod shots unless absolutely necessary.  Made mine worse.  Double check meds some can cause these symptoms and fatigue, hair loss,  delayed healing or make you more prone to infections. If doc won't listen find a better one who will. They are not just treating a disease,  they're treating a person.  Sometimes they forget that. Good luck best wish.\\nThanks for writing.  Yes, I hear you.  I'm a PT smoker, was told to quit.  I was taking Narcotics for pain, I was told to quit.  Man oh man, just no relief in this disease at all.  I'm taking Humira and Imuran.  I feel toxic.  I think we need fecal transplants.  I hear some are not waiting for big pharma -they are merely asking healthy friends to fill empty capsules with stool.  I know, it sounds horrid but what can we do?\\n\\nIso~\\nI've done a bit of research on the fecal transplant heard it is more effective for problems stemming from bacterial infection.  Don't know how well it would do for crohns because your immune system is attacking you not really bacterial.  Plus wouldn't want capsule to dissolve in stomach might make it worse. With joint pain even though it hurts try to keep stretching them. Also try warm or cool packs sometimes it helps a bit. Some docs are bad about helping with pain they don't get it. Once had doc tell me he only helps with pain if patient iz terminal.  Like you only deserve to be comfortable in your own body if your dying.  Find one with more compassion.  Either way its hard. Do what's best for you. Why are you on immuran and humira? They're both immune suppressant.  I would think humira would be enough.\\nWell,\\n\\nMy previous UC and J-Pouch surgery complicate everything.  So I'm now Crohn's with these other issues.  Some percentage apparently lose their J-Pouch and require permanent Ileostomy, so my Dr's med plan is geared to saving the Pouch -hence the Humira + Imuran + Cipro.  The guy is all about stats, maybe a good thing, maybe not, I can hardly think straight from doing this dance for so many years.   I've always been able to push through many of the GI symptoms and get a few things done in life but these non-GI symptoms are in many ways more debilitating than I ever thought possible.\\n\\nYes, many theories out there.  One is that the immune system is under performing which is counter to the accepted immune suppression therapy.  Another cellular theory is that there are genetic flaws that don't allow the cells to eliminate waste products or pathogens.  The Gel-Cap I was speaking of would survive the stomach and release in the small bowel.  I have no first hand accounts of anyone actually doing this with any success but there are studies and a few c-diff patients who were brought back from the brink with the procedure...\\n\\nAs for Narcotics, the patient should be the boss of their pain.  I feel like if I can't cope with the discomfort then I should allowed to make that call -if it means a Fentanyl patch for life, then so be it.  Unfortunately, a high Narcotic load causes mechanical bowel issues and other problems so the decision is always a balance.  I'm currently on a trickle dose of Dilaudid, nearly in withdrawal, then on really bad days I blast it with a good dose and I seem to get the full benefit for at least a few hours.  That seems the best I can hope for since I've tried them all and had very high daily doses in an effort to function and get relief but tolerance would ramp up too quickly and my GI tract would begin to melt down from it...\\n\\nBest efforts that work somewhat, walking, hot baths or hot tubs, sleep, small meals, Probiotics, and Klonopin.\\n\\nIso~\\nIsotope,\\n\\nWell I hope they can keep your j pouch and not do the iliostomy. I've talked to another who went through that w/UC and cancerous cells. She now has a bag and its not been healing well. I've been lucky to stay out of surgery these past years.  My disease is now mostly in jejunum and at the resection area where small meets large intestine.\\n\\nI tend to think crohns could have different types for people. Some could be bacterial but for myself I tend to think my immune system is crazy attacking itself. Rounds of cipro and flagyl have never helped me and I have other health issues immune related. My CD is mainly inflammation and ulcers. It seems each person has different symptoms and degrees of illness.  Some take better to the meds than others and some are mild cases, while others are moderate or severe.\\n\\nAlso, if you haven't already check you vit d, b12 and magnesium levels. Being low on those can worsen and even cause some of those other symptoms. Check out low magnesium especially you might be surprised how many symptoms it can cause.\\n\\nIts been nice talking with someone else with these problems.  I don't know anyone else with crohns and as much as they might try to understand friends and family don't always get how bad it can be. Thank you.\",\n",

Do you have copies of them to review the pathology results?\\n\\nIs the location of your UC throughout or limited?\\n\\nWhat is your med history?  What's your flare history...constant? controlled..etc.\\n\\nHaving UC as well, I would opt for the surgery if there were several areas plus a polyp with dysplasia.  The main reason would be because I'd constantly be worried about it, and the eventuality would be surgery anyway...or worse.\\n\\nI think that those of us with UC have the benefits of more c-scopes and biopsies with the only conclusion of precancer/cancer to have complete removal of the colon rather than areas.\\n\\nI'm going to wait for your answers before I comment further.\\n\\nq\\nThanks for your reply.\\nMy patholology reports from 1 & 2 years ago showed active colitis with several small foci of low grade dysplasia.  My most recent pathology report (from 3/1/13) showed the same active colitis with several areas of low grade dysplasia plus an adenomatous polyp with low grad dysplasia in my ascending colon.  All of the areas were negative for high grade dysplasia and malignancy.\\n\\nMy colitis is thoughout my entire colon but I have not been having any issues with it lately.  I've had a couple of flare ups in the last 15 years, which subsided after about a couple of weeks on low dose prednisone.  I've been taking Apriso (4-.375g) and Immuran (1-25mg) daily which has controlled the colitis.\\n\\nDr. is recommending complete removal of my colon and a pelvic pouch (pull through) procedure, which would require a temporary ileostomy.\\n\\nSince I havn't been having issues with my colitis, this decision is even more difficult.  I'm currently just trying to get more information and determine the risks of colon cancer if I don't have the procedure.\\n\\nAny information and support is greatly appreciated.\\nHi...I would do serious research on dysplasia and what that means.  Since you already have a history of it over the past 2 years, to me it would be an easier decision of the inevitable.  better to make the decision than be forced, and you would be doing the surgery for ultimate prevention rather than already progression.\\n\\nSince you do have active colitis, your meds aren't controlling the inflammation...even though you're not having obvious symptoms...it's not a good sign for the dysplasia.\\n\\nYou definitely need to ask questions on the colon cancer forum, hopefully others will be able to lead you further.  Ultimately, the decision is yours.\\n\\nI wouldn't hesitate to have my colon removed given your situation.  The truth spoken, for I know of a few people who have died from colon cancer. You have the benefit of early knowledge that many don't.\\n\\nHow is your family history regarding colon cancer?\\n\\nq\\nI'm continueing to research dysplasia and it's links to CRC.  It seems there is some disagreement with when a colectomy is necessary with reguard to low grade dysplasia.  Also there is inconsistency with pathologists diagnosis of dysplasia.\\n\\nI am waiting on a second look at biopsies from pathologist from Cleveland Clinic.  In the mean time, still gathering information.\\n\\nI have no history of CRC in my family.  Unfortunately, both my mom (overian) and dad (melanoma) died of cancer in their mid 60's.  My brother also passed away form Multiple Myloma.  Not sure that any of it relates to my condition but it does make me think cancer is much higher risk.\\nWhat are you most afraid of to consider the surgery?\\n\\nTo me, your risks are high, and being on Imuran can push the risks of cancer a bit in the plus rather than the negative.  Do your research on that as well.\\n\\nDysplasia is the early stage...the warning stage.  Since yours has been continual over the past few years with no change to improvement(meaning less sites), it's certainly a game of chance to continue to see what happens.\\n\\nHowever, everything is...if things are taken in comparison.\\n\\nAs well, the sites are varied throughout the colon, if the doc took at least 5 from each section each year,  I would assume that your entire colon is in a state of dysplasia.\\n\\nHave you had blood marker tests done?  maybe that's a route you could explore to see how that may measure up...although not all are conclusive, and that may cause more disagreement than purposeful guide.\\n\\nHave you had an MRI or other test that could see if there are other sites that might be questionable?\\n\\nPlease let me know.\\n\\nq\\nHi Eagle,\\n\\nI know this is an older post but I wanted to comment, as I'm in a similar position as you.\\n\\nI had a large polyp removed two years ago which came back pre cancerous but my GI wasn't overly concerned because based on the pathology at the time, it was rather unremarkable and wasn't related to my UC.  He continues to monitor the area every time I have a colonoscopy for changes, taking biopsies of the area where the polyp had been removed.  Things had been fine but with my last colonoscopy in June,  the pathology came back showing low grade dysplasia, so my GI had me come in and we talked about it, that the recommended guidelines indicate complete removal of the colon so he wanted to prepare me for that. I was stunned with this news because I've been in remission for several years (currently taking Imuran), so I do understand how hard it is to reconcile feeling good, having the disease controlled and yet being told the whole thing has to come out anyway. It really messes with your head a bit.\\n\\nMy GI doc is in a bit of a disagreement with the pathologist based on the minimal dysplasia.  So my GI is taking an aggressive monitoring approach, to have another colonoscopy in 6 months (scheduled for next week) and we'll see if the pathology comes back the same.  If it shows more definitive results with the dysplasia, then it's surgery. If it's status quo, we do another colonoscopy in 6 months, and reassess again.\\n\\nI was thinking getting a second pathology opinion from the Cleveland Clinic as well.  We'll see what comes about next week.\\n\\nAnyway, just wanted to reach out, see if you've gone forward with the surgery of if you're still monitoring things.\\n\\nUC, the gift that keeps on giving!\\nI have not had the surgery yet.  I'm doing something similar to you....having colonoscopies every 6 months.   I had my last colonoscopy in September and things looked about the same with colitis thoughout the colon and one area with low grade dysplasia.  I'm going back to GI Dr. in a couple weeks, he is still recommending colectemy.  I'm still unsure what I will do since I'm not having any problems with the colitis.\\n\\nLet me know how things go and if you go to Cleveland Clinic.\\nYou know, it makes me feel a bit better knowing someone is doing a similar approach. I mean, whatever is going to be is going to be, but I also want whatever I do to be based on rational thinking and data rather than on complete fear.  And I'd like it to be on my terms which I know isn't always possible but that's always my goal.\\n\\nI'll let you know what comes about.\\n\\nStay Healthy!\\nHi Eagle just wanted to let you know my colonoscopy went well yesterday.  Barring anything funky from the pathology report, everything looks in good shape.  My GI is happy with things and doesn't expect the pathology to reveal anything progressing.   He did burn the entire area where the polyp had been so that new healthy tissue can grow in.  Plus he tattooed around the area so he will be to see where the specific area was and how it's doing during subsequent scopes.  So that continues to be the plan for, keep tight and aggressive with the surveillance. Fortunately, I'm also still in remission.\\n\\nMy colon lives another day!\\n\\nHope things continue to remain status quo with you!\",\n",

I do suffer alot of symptoms. stiff joints, nausea, brain fog, my legs get very heavy and I have trouble walking. However over the years I have had alot of gastric problems. My weight goes up and down as does my appetite. I have lost alot of weight at times and only put a bit back on. Two years ago I had gastroenteritis, it nearly killed me and I lost 3 stone. I am noticing that if I eat certain foods I get terrible brain fog, its like feeling drunk after eating and my bowels just seem to go into a knot. Sometimes the pain is so bad i can be on my hands and knees. Twice this year I have been admitted to hospital with an impacted bowel and now I seem to live on Lactulose, milk of magnesia and buscopam to help with the cramps. Lots of other symptoms, ie extreme tiredness, inflammed eyes, night sweats and so on. Does anyone else get impacted bowels, its so painful, iv been put on morphine each time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, does this sound like Crohns?.....Thanks...\\n\\n\\nParasites are an epidemic these days. PARATREX cleanse WORKS (all-natural) GREAT along with LOTS of alkaline water! You may also want to get a liver/gallbladder detox. All can be purchased online. You'll feel bad during the elimination due to the body detoxing and ridding of whatever is hosting your body. Parasites cause many auto-immune diseases; and more often, than NOT, go undetected lots in stool specimens during lab tests. A healthy immune system begins with a healthy digestive tract. Years of rotten feces cling to intestinal walls, parasites host humans/animals/pets and feed on nutrition causing a laundry list of life-threatening illnesses. PARATREX works GREAT! Paratrex can be ordered online. Adopt a high-fiber, high alkaline diet of fresh fruits/veggies (organic foods, drink lots of alkaline water) for long, quality-filled life. Being gluten/wheat/dairy free brings about tremendous results. Meat proteins are highly acidic too. CLEANSE REGULARLY.\",\n",

They did a CT scan and it showed imflamation in my sigmoid colon area and my blood work showed some infection. I was admitted to the hospital for a few days and given antibotics.  I had a colonoscopy and my husband said that the DR didn't find anything.  I don't know if he took any tissue samples.  I have a lot of stomach pain and was hoping to get some kind of answer.  Maybe it was just a one time thingi don't know.   Anyone else had a normal colonospy and still have some kind of imflamatory bowel condition?\\nWho was the doctor that did the c-scope?\\n\\nWhat exactly are your symptoms at this point.\\nq\\nA gastro dr did the colonoscopy.  Back the end of July I started out with upper right quardart pain.  I figured it was phantom pains from having my gallbladder taken out 8 months prior.  after having that pain for a week I had a sudden onset of left lower quadart pain and had diarhea, i normally am constipated. After 4 days I went to the Dr who said it could be diverticulitis.  Later that evening I went to the ER because of the pain and the meds my general dr gave me I can't take.  They did blood work and a ct.  The Ct scan showed imflamation to my sigmoid colon. I was admited to the hospital for iv antibotic because the blood work showed elevated white blood count.  So yesterday I had a colonoscopy and my husband said the doctor said everything looked good and he didn't see anything.  I am only 27 but for as long as I can remember I have had issues with my stomach.  I still have pains in my stomach from time to time.  Fro the past 2 days my right upper quad has been hurting, what I call phantom pains but I guess it could be something else.  I had the same pain prior to having my gallbladder removed and didn't have any of the normal gallbladder problems all i had was pain and a low ejection fraction of 5%.  I also haven't had any of the common issues people who have had their gallbladder out have.  I don't know what it is that is wrong.\",\n",

It was like an attack under my left rib round my side and up to my left shoulder... I had a scan on my pancreas a chest X-ray all clear, my bloods showed what the told me was small inflammation until I returned again a couple of days later, they gave me tramadol ora-morph and a morphine patch and only then did the pain sit at bay they did a scope n said I was constipated and topped me up with a bunch of laxatives and I spent the next week waiting to have a bm before being discharged\\n\\nI returned to the states at the end of may soon after ran out of both the morphine patches at tramadol, low and behold the pain returned!

I'm so ready to be pain free\\nDamn this crohns disease and all it brings lol ive literally only just fought of a damn abscess too haha, just not been my lucky month\\n\\nSorry for the length & Tia!\\nLeft upper quadrant pain can come from the spleen, especially if it is enlarged. Since Chrohn's is autoimmune, it is possible you are developing another autoimmune disease affecting your spleen. Your spleen is where red blood cells are broken down, and the breakdown can be excessive, which can cause the urine to be dark from bilirubin pigments. I would ask to have a urine check, for bilirubin and other abnormalities, have your spleen examined, some blood tests including a CBC, Coombs test for autoimmune breakdown of RBC, and ANA. Of course, Crohn's can cause bowel complications such as perforations, adhesions and obstructions, and an abdominal ultrasound may help sort some of that out. Keep us posted and I hope your Dr is thorough at checking this out.\\nSounds to me like u have adhesions have u ever had stomached surgery\\nThank you both for your replies I am hoping to reschedule my appointment next week and get to the bottom of it!!\\nMy CBCs have been coming back normal but I shall ask him if he thinks he needs to do some further tests to check my spleen!\\n\\nAnd nope never had surgery yet (touches wood) can adhesions occur without surgery?

Well I was wondering if you could tell me your symptoms when it first started and how it is now? I am now thinking that it may be something I have had longer than I thought. I did have to go to doc about 3-4yrs ago for stomach pain and they gave me prilosec for 2 weeks which cured it. Then a couple years ago i was having severe stomach and digestive problems which I noticed to be related to milk. I then stopped consumming it and felt so much better. Been dairy free since then with the occasional bite. a 1 and a half yrs ago I had to be on doxycycline for a year for a chronic infection. Well 8 months into the medicine I noticed some more stomach and digestive problems. Now everything is all messed up. I know antibiotics can mess you up. I do know there is a report on doxy causing crohns. Which my gi doc kinda ignored. He said I should be better if I would stop the doxy so I did and 6 months later I am still no better. Anyways I was wondering if I could have had crohns or some other autoimmune disease all this time and the symptoms were flaring up but the prilosec and the dairy free diet suppressed the symptoms. Then the doxy made it become active again. Could that be possible?\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi, I\\'m new to this forum but i have a few questions that really need answers. My daughter is 4 years old and about a year ago she started having abdominal pains and she would run a fever only in her mid section though and she would be constipated sometimes and diarrhea with blood other times. I switched her pediatrician because i felt her pediatrician was not listening to me. Now she has a new doctor and he referred me to a pedi gastroenterologist. So on September 12, 2012 they did some kind of blood test and the lady said in her exact words \"We tested her for Crohn\\'s disease and Ulcerative colitis. The Crohn\\'s was negative but the Ulcerative Colitis test was postive. It immediately turned the tube a different color.\" she also said that my baby pancreas enzymes were elevated. So yesterday October 12, 2012 (Friday) her gastroenterologist did a colonoscopy on her with a biopsy, but we wont get the results back until next week. I was told that the blood test for UC is not accurate and her diagnosis could be wrong. So My question is, Is the blood test for UC accurate and will the biopsy confirms if she has UC or will it tell whats wrong? My baby has been suffering for a year and she\\'s so young, to young for this. This situation has really drained me to the core. Please answer if you have any idea or knowledge of what I\\'m saying.\\nThanks,\\nConcerned Mommy\\nHi Felicia\\n\\nSorry to \\'meet\\' you like this! I think there\\'s nothing more upsetting than for our beloved children to be sick. It\\'s such a helpless feeling! I am so sorry! As you now know, change doctors until one will listen. They are just human, and they aren\\'t all equal.\\n\\nHere is a good resource\\nhttp://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/colitis/\\n\\nI don\\'t have personal experience, but my daughter (grown now) has. Hers was diagnosed with a blood test. When I was born I was described as having colic, and always have problems at various times in my life, and I have to go back to bland foods, and there are other things very helpful to soothe the system. It isn\\'t a cure, but best she learn now how to take care of her personal physical tendency.\\n\\nUnless her life is threatened please don\\'t let them do surgery. My daughter almost never has a problem now, nor do I. Even if she has an autoimmune disease there are things that can be done to bring down the inflammation and help facilitate healing that you may want to try before adding a regimen of drugs. we never had surgery or used the drugs.\\n\\nFirst follow the advice for food in the link above...no caffeine, sodas, and for that matter no fruit juice. Avoid sugary drinks. Later on after her system is calmed down she can have an occasional cookie (no nuts). Not while she has bleeding ulcers in there. No spicey foods or food cooked in oil, butter or fats. They are hard on a raw digestive system. For now, avoid meats, grains and don\\'t give her any raw vegetables. No cooked greens. They are all too harsh on her right now. Give her system a rest so it can heal.\\n\\nIf not allergic to these foods, right now she can eat fresh soft cooked apple with a very light sprinkle of honey or cinnamon, or with no flavoring. only use a little of cold-pressed olive oil, which is easy to digest. She can eat mashed banana (not too ripe or too green). Other soft cooked vegetables with a little olive oil are OK. such as soft cooked yams or sweet potatoes, white rice are soothing.\\n\\nI am sorry I have an appointment, but rest assured there are some things you can do. I will get back to you. I will be praying for her and for you and the rest of the family. This affects all of you, I know.\\n\\nBlessings and hugs.\\nTF\\nThanks for the information and advice it was really helpful!!\\nHi Felicia,\\n\\nI\\'m back. You are welcome!\\n\\nI forgot to mention, make sure to peel the apples. She shouldn\\'t get roughage right now.\\n\\nOK,some more info... regardless reasons\\nshe has these problems there are things you can do for her that are not harmful, that soothes the entire digestive system & helps it relax so it can recover. It takes time. But my daughter had marked improvement in three days time. Every situation is different, so be patient.\\n\\nI\\'m not a person that believes diet cures everything, but your daughter\\'s diet is critical right now...from experience I know that stress uses up the B complex vitamins and that they are critical as they feed the nerves. Normally any over the counter B complex vitamin is fine, but when the digestive tract isn\\'t working normally nutrients must be in a more natural and digestible form.\\n\\nBrewer\\'s yeast powder can be gotten in bulk from health food stores. You won\\'t want to buy more than about a 1/4 pound at a time, as one takes a small amount per day. It is a food rich in naturally balanced B complex vitamins. It isn\\'t wonderful tasting on it\\'s own, but a 1/2 teaspoon of the powder sprinkled on mashed banana or steamed apple doesn\\'t taste bad. You can give that to her once a day for two days, then twice a day until her gut settles down. Taking this daily is good for anyone, esp a stressed out mom. I take it mixed in orange juice.\\n\\nGive her a good quality probiotic or acidophilus to rebalance the normal good VS bad bacteria in the gut. Ask for a knowledgeable person at a health food store to help you choose one. Give it to her as instructed. That too is good for all of us.\\n\\nThe other thing I recommend is food grade aloe vera juice, daily, and again it has healing qualities but is benign and won\\'t do any harm. All of these can be bought at a health food store and don\\'t cost much compared to the benefits.\\n\\nShe needs taught to take care of her body and not eat or hardly ever spicey, greasy foods again. Even if the body settles down when we are prone to a problem, such as a weak digestive system we have to take special care of it.\\n\\nI say this, but don\\'t always follow my own advice. Then I pay for it big time. Right now I am nauseated from too many rich or spicey meals and so seeing your post reminds me what I need to do.\\n\\nI\\'m off to bake some sweet potatoes! By the way, real maple syrup tastes wonderful on them and it\\'s good for us, too!\\n\\nPlease stay in touch and let us know how your daughter is doing and how you are holding up! I will keep on praying for her full recovery.\\n\\nOh, and plain yogurt is a good source of probiotics and also protein while she heals. Easy to digest. Don\\'t get the sweetened kind. If you want you can added a little bit of honey, and can add fresh fruit you peeled and steamed yourself.\\nOh wow so much information. This is all new to me and I vow to do my best with her diet. Im really waiting on her biopsy to return, because i wanna give the cafeteria at her school a change of diet form but it has to be signed by her pedi gastroenterologist and he may not sign it if he don\\'t know for sure if she has UC. It\\'s taking forever to get the results!!\\nUpdate on Kensie: Her biopsy results came back and she does have UC. It\\'s not bad though, so they say, she\\'s on prednisone and previcid. I\\'m praying for a complete healing though!!!\\nGood for her!! I\\'m so glad. It makes recovery so much easier.\\n\\nShe can have plain store bought applesauce too, if it says there is no added sugar.\\nFor protein give her poultry or fish...no lamb or pork and after her gut is healed, you can try low fat beef once a week and see how she does having it only occasionally.\\n\\nPlease let us know how she is doing.\\nthanks Tree Frog. its weird tho becaus even though they say it mild she still complains of her tummy hurting. she has another appointment on November 14 though thank God and I will tell him everything I need too. It could be her pancreas. we will just have to wait and see.\\nMy daughter was diagnosed with Crohn\\'s 7 years ago.  She got very thin and sick, before the diagnosis, but after they put her on prednisone for a short time, and she began to follow the diet in the book Breaking The Vicious Cycle and she has been symptom and drug free ever since. *knock wood*  Sometimes she cheats and eats something that she shouldn\\'t and she says that she can feel it, (stomach pain) so the diet appears to be working.  I tell her not to cheat but I know it\\'s hard to be perfect all of the time.\\n\\nI wish your young daughter all the best!',\n",

My diet is pretty clean, lots of lean protein, veggies, good carbs like oatmeal, rice, etc. I tend to avoid fruits because they make me have to go to the bathroom more often.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nJoe\\nI will tell you what helped me.  I have lived with UC for 2 years.  I have been in remission for the last 6 months.  I had moderate to severe UC.  Bad days BMs 8-12 times a day.  Spent half my waking hours on the toilet on bad days.  Suspicious of everything I ate.  Severe cramps and nasuea.  Scope and blood test with the diagnosis delivered by the nurse practitioner (doctor always booked out at least 2 months).  One day the normal NP was on vacation so got to see the other NP.  I was on 2.4 g of Lialda a day.  Did a course of prednesone which didn\\'t help the UC (made the aches and pains go away while I trained and raced Mtn bike s(hobby) (surprisingly I didn\\'t have to go when I was riding (was in the porta potty until the race started though). The normal NP was guiding me toward remicade.   Didn\\'t want to do that so when I saw the other NP I asked if there was anything else?  He said VSL#3 (probiotic) had some success in limited clinical trials.  It didn\\'t work as advertised just taking it alone.  Got to thinking the best I felt over the two years was after the colonoscopy.  Colon seemed to heal a little.  So asked the NP if I could get some colon prep.  He said no but there is some over the counter colon cleanse (magnesium citrate I think).  He said take plenty of electrolytes just like the colon prep.  I go till clear on a Saturday (drink plenty of water and electrolytes (warm chicken broth, gatorade, tea and jello work for me).  Don\\'t eat until Sunday.  Take 8 VSL #3 capsules first thing Sunday morning (capsules I think give the bacteria the best chance of making it through the stomach and are no where near as nasty as the powder in water).  Keep taking your medication for the UC (mine was as mentioned above the Lialda).  Start eating low fiber food for a few days and move to more normal food. Bananas are a great prebiotic so eat a few bananas right after taking the VSL#3.    I took 4 to 6 VSL#3 capsules each day along with the Lialda.  Started to feel better within a few days with fewer BM\\'s but the UC was not completely gone.   Stools were  loose for nearly a month while the bacteria repopulated my GI tract.  I had to repeat the cleanse after about a month when my symptoms flared up again (I wouldn\\'t do a cleanse more than once a month, I think it is hard on the body and you loose some weight in process).  It steadily got better each week and better every time I did a cleanse.  It took  4 months before my colon healed and my BM\\'s looked normal (didn\\'t think I would remember what that  looked like).  The bottom line is it worked for me and it may not work for everyone.  Sounds like medication advertisement but ask your doctor first.  The VSL#3 by itself has some clinical evidence that it works and I think no risk of side effects.   Just taking the VSL#3 everyday did not work for me.  Reducing the problem bacteria population with a cleanse and seeding my GI track with the good bacteria population seemed to help me.  I had some flare ups when I traveled for work and ate hotel yogurt (so only take the VSL#3 and no other yogurt, keifer or other probiotics for a few months (probably UC food suspicion on my part but happened twice).  I went on an 8 day backpacking trip recently so no VSL #3 for 8 days with no issues.  I just recently stopped taking the lialda but keep a full bottle just in case.  It may be temporary but I am enjoying the remission.  I hope this helps someone else cause I felt pretty hopeless more than a few times.\\nDaughter was diagnosed with Crohn\\'s 7 years ago.

I ended up in hospital for two weeks on 400mg IV hydrocortisone per day. It took quite some time for the hydrocortisone to start working, but it eventually did, and on the day my flare turned around, my GI started me on Imuran....given Imuran doesn't work for ~3 months, I know my flare was totally cleared with the hydrocortisone (and now I'm tapering prednisolone and am down to 25mg).\\nIt was my worst ever ulcerative colitis flare, but it was 4 months after I had a baby and I've heard that autoimmune diseases often flare most severely after having a baby. Previously I'd only ever had one attack that was bad enough to need prednisolone and that one cleared up within 12 hours after my first dose of 30mg.\\nMy problem now is that I HATE being on Imuran. I never wanted to be on it. I'm an outdoorsy person, with fair skin and living in Australia where the UV is always high, so I hate the heightened risk of skin cancer. I hate waking up and taking a cancer-causing drug every morning...and I can't relax or enjoy the things I used to because I'm so worried about cancer. I've now got severe anxiety (also needing medication)... but my GI absolutely insists I need Imuran. She thinks my anxiety was brought on by the prednisolone? I don't know what to do because if I stay on Imuran, I will surely have a cancer within ~20 years and I'm only 30. I don't want to be on Imuran indefinitely. Because my GI doesn't support me coming off it, I feel anxiety when I think about doing so because I'll be worried about a bad flare.\\nAny suggestions/advice?\\nHave you ever been on any of the oral AND rectal mesalamines?\\n\\nq\\nI don't think the data demonstrates that you're guaranteed to get cancer from Imuran.\\n\\nMaybe he can put you on something else, and if it doesn't work, then try Imuran.  That's what I did with my GI when my meds stopped working and I needed to go on something else.  I told him I had concerns with Imuran and so he said we could try Lialda first (my GI said he didn't think it would work and he was right but he let me try that first).  After a lot of soul searching, crushing fatigue, anemia that required iron transfusions and pain, my desire to be well trumped my fears about what may happen down the road.    I've been on it since 2008 and have been flare free since. I feel great.\\n\\nIn the end, it's your choice what you put into your body.  You have to do what you feel is right for you, but you have to go into any decision informed with the pros and cons so you can weigh the risks and benefits.   I've never made a good decision solely out of fear.\\n\\nHope you feel better soon.\\nThanks for the replies.\\nQuincy - yes, I have been taking oral and rectal meselamines (salofalk enemas and mezavant tablets). I'm also taking a cortisone enema.\\nPwno - I think I'd be similar to you and would come around to Imuran if I knew I needed it and nothing else could work, but I started Imuran when I was already recovering with steroid treatment, so I'm not convinced I need it...but my GI is very bossy and doesn't like me making the decisions. I feel a bit like I was bullied into starting it and she won't support me trying without.\\nI actually decided not to take it today - I'm not sure what I will do tomorrow. I'm still on 20mg of prednisolone that will probably keep things under control, but I'm tapering 5mg per week. I'm scared to come off the Imuran on my own, in case I flare up and don't have any medical support (my doc will be angry)...but I just hate taking it. I've been on it for about 1.5 months so far (do you think that's long enough for it actually to be having an impact?) I will book in to get a second opinion from a different doctor in the new year.\\nFor me, it took about three months for the Imuran to start working.\\n\\nSteroids are a short term solution, not long term disease maintenance. So I suspect your GI started you on Imuran now so that by the time you're completely off the steroids, you'll be supported by the Imuran.\\n\\nBut, I think it's worth getting a second opinion for your own peace of mind and to see what else is available to you.  If it were me, I'd start calling new GI's first thing on Monday because it can take a while to get into any kind of specialist.  You don't want to be hanging out there too long without a game plan.\\n\\nGood luck!\",\n",

I had never brought it up to my doctor, but now that I am going away to college next year I feel that I need an answer to my issue. Most of the time when I go out to eat at a restaurant, I end up with a horrible stomach ache. I feel fine at first but then about 20-30 minutes later I suddenly get nauseas and have horrible pains and need to go to the bathroom asap. I usually have diarrhea and end up in the bathroom for a quite a while. I also have other abnormalties that might be connected to my stomach issues. I'm currently 18 years old and first got my period when I was about 13. It is very irregular, for instance, the last time I got it was in June and it is currently November. Also, i have very itchy skin and have eczema, seasonal and a few medication allergies, and I have a little bit of anxiety. And lastly, I read a few articles that say there might be a link between crohns and kidney stones. This past June I ended up in the emergency room because I had my first (and hopefully only) kidney stone. Please please please someone let me know what you think of my symptoms. I have friends that have crohns and they said that the same bathroom issue happened to them. Also both parents have some sort of digestive issue.\\nSorry to hear you are having a hard time. My digestive issues started while I was in high school as well, and it is really difficult!\\nIt sounds like you may have Crohn's or Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Definitely go to your family doctor and get a referral to a GI. That is definitely something you want to get under control before going off to college, trust me! I really hope everything works out for you!\\nHello\\n\\nI had severe diarrhoea, weight loss and stomach pain, lost 3 stone in 6 weeks, doctors said it was all in my mind and needed to see a psychiatrist.  I refused and after seeing a surgeon he put me under the knife so to speak and had a laparotomy where part of my intestines were removed and found that I had crohns disease.  Everytime I have problems no matter what they are my stomache goes into spasms but I do know what it is now so I can cope.   It is not knowing what is wrong is the main concern\\n\\nMy nan died from bowel cancer and my neice at the age of 17 was dianosed with Ulcerative Coilitis who had a iliostomy fitted.

My Mother was dx with Pernicious Anemia and had to have Vit B12 shots. Just wonder if it could be related?\\nYou need to have visual testing and biopsies to help make a diagnosis.  Your mom's pernicious anemia could be related to a dysfunction of the small intestine that you might have interited...but again...biopsies might help make some diagnosis.\\n\\nThe yellow/green colour of stool really means not enough bile...\\n\\nAre you seeing a liver specialist?\\n\\nA small bowel follow through and a colonoscopy might help determine what's going on.\\n\\nHave you been tested for possible celiac's?\\n\\nq\",\n",

A few days ago, all of a sudden the seton seemed to hang much looser than it was and a small bit of blue thread came out. Now it seems to have started to untie itself, there are two bits hanging out. Also, the fistula wound seems to have turned some of itself out (if you can work out want I mean, some of it is on the outside, I think). I rang the surgeon's secretary and today, missed the phone call from the surgeon. He left a message saying it was nothing to be worried about. However, the only information he had was that it was loose, I hadn't explained to the secretary that two bits of it were hanging out. Basically, I'm just wondering if anyone else has had experience with setons and if what I'm experiencing is normal? If a seton does come out, how will I know if it is and what happens then? Will I have to have a full operation again? Thanks. Also, I'm in the UK so with the NHS.\",\n",

That should be a tell if you have any \"invader bacteria\" in there.\\n\\nYour symptoms are definitely what I experienced....very painful and scary to say the least.   Having you on the antibiotics initially could very well help if you have bacterial infection.   It won\\'t help if it\\'s viral, however.  How long have you been on the meds?\\n\\nIt sounds as though the inflammation is limited to just the rectum because you\\'re not having diarrhea as of yet...that\\'s the gummy worm stools.

If the biopsies have cellular changes that are consistent with UC...then the diagnosis would probably be UC if it fits in with the pattern of UC.  The pathology will not state it is .... only consistent with.  The GI will usually diagnose that is is (based on what he has excluded as possibilities).\\n\\nOf course, some patterns of CD can mimic UC when CD is in early stages...some cellular changes, etc can be in the grey area of indeterminate colitis...meaning it could be one or the other.   if it\\'s suspected that it\\'s Crohn\\'s...the doctor would more than likely send the patient for further testing to see if there are other areas of inflammation in the digestive tract..not only the colon.  If there are, it\\'s suspected that it would be CD and not UC.  CD does involve deeper layers of the digestive tract...UC\\'s involvement only goes as deep as the mucosal/submucosal and sometimes into the lamina propira.\\n\\nIhope you get your answers soon...there\\'s nothing worse than the waiting.

My email has been messed up so I did not know until now you had posted. Here\\'s where I\\'m at right now. I been seeing the pcp who suspects crohns or uc.

He then informed me he isn\\'t a gastro doc, just family doc that does scopes. What?!?! I was livid. I thought he was an idiot. I knew it wasn\\'t my meds and I was confident my pcp would feel the same I did. I took it upon myself to make appt with a real gastro doc one that my relative has used and really likes. I go see him on the 27th, next week. It can\\'t get here soon enough. The idiot doc I seen did run labs and said all my labs were great. However I was also told my pharmacy friend and online research that my igg and my iga were low. So I\\'m not sure what\\'s going on with those results nor do I know if they have anything to do with crohns or uc. My iga was 12.2 and my igg was 18.9. Does that mean anything to y\\'all? Lol labs all confirmed no infection no bacteria or anything. I ended up in er last night. Couldn\\'t take it anymore. They gave me nausea and pain meds and told me to get to gastro ASAP and asked if I had ever been diagnosed with crohns or uc. WARNING-TMI- I also have some excruciating pain. Well you know, down there. During and after bm. Sometimes for an hour or so after even. I have 2 kids and let me tell you, whatever it is down there is causing excruciating pain. I\\'ve never felt it before. I also have inspected the situation and there is something there. Not sure what. Not sure if that is common in uc or crohns either. Any help or suggestions would be great. I feel like I am up against a wall and facing this alone. This has been ongoin since feb. 22 and it is not getting any better. This is my sons spring break. He is 7. My youngest is 4. They wanna do fun stuff. But thanks to me it isn\\'t going well. Thanks so muh for listening to me and helping me out!! Any chance y\\'all are in oklahoma? Lol\\nTMRJ, Perhaps you can call the GI office and get into a cancellation spot sooner since you are so sick and in such pain. Both Crohns and UC can cause mucus in the stools,(looks like clumps of egg white) and blood, along with the pain. I would also ask the GI Dr to check you for gluten sensitivity, as it may be related to inflammatory bowel disease. The IGA and IGG are immune globulins, like antibodies. When they are low it can make you prone to infection. I would expect those to be high in inflammation of GI tract. You might also ask to be checked for C Difficile, as that can cause severe diarrhea and pain, and can actually be caused by Cipro. That is a blood test your GP could run now, especially if still on the Cipro. It is a bacteria that produces a toxin that really irritates the intestine. You have been thru a lot! I would call the GI and beg/plead for an earlier appt. Please keep us posted.\\nThanks. I have already been tested for all those things an they were all negative. As far as getting into the gastro ASAP the one I want is off this week spending time with his family on springs break and I go see him next Wednesday. I would rather hold off till then and see the one I want and know is good rather just be thrown into te arms of any doc I know nothing about. When I see him in 27th though I am going to make sure he knows how desperate I am and see if he can get me in ASAP for the scope.',\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi there,\\n\\nI'm just writing to get some advice from those who know first hand and have experience with colitis.\\n\\nOn Jan. 24 my daughter had a colonoscopy to find out that she had a severe colitis infection in a portion of her colon.  The surgeon thought it was probably not ulcerative and hoped with the use of Asacol that it would clear up and not be a problem for her anymore.  She seemed fine for about 3 weeks afterward, taking the Asacol then a sudden flare-up that is causing her alot of abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, nausea, hot flashed, muscle and headaches.  I took her to Emergency, they said it was normal to have flare-ups even while on medication.  Thats it, no advice, no alternatives given!\\n\\nSo, since then, she's been home from school almost a week.  We've changed her diet, removed Dairy completely, she's taking probiotics and vitamins, drinking green and peppermint tea for nausea......We've tried it all and she has moments where it seems to be improving but then it goes bad in a hurry again.\\n\\nAnything I've read tells me its normal and could last a couple days to a couple weeks.  She's only 14 and I hate to watch her suffer, she's normally so outgoing but has no ambition for anything right now.\\n\\nCan anyone give me any insight, advice, anything that might help at all would be greatly appreciated.  Just trying to understand and know what to expect and when to worry.\\nThanks in advance!\\nHi...Did you get the results of the colonoscopy biopsies?  I would suggest you get a copy.\\n\\nWas your daughter seeing a gastro doc or a GP?\\n\\nHow many mgs of Asacol is she taking?\\n\\nq\\nNo I didn't get a copy but have seen the results and pictures several times.  The surgeon was the one who diagnosed it as a colitis infection, said he thought it would clear up but to come see him in a month.  She is taking 800 mg 3 times a day (prescribed by the surgeon).  I was just told to increase it to 2 pills twice a day.  I wasn't expecting a flare-up as it was never explained.  She has been referred to a gastro-intestinal specialist but could be several months before she can see her.  Thanks.\\nHi...colitis infection would mean from something....did the doc say specifically what the infection was?  I'm surprised that he didn't give your daughter any antibiotics...unless her infection was caused by previously using antibiotics?\\n\\nI suggest you call the surgeon's office and request to go pick up a copy of the biopsy report and do the research long before you see the gastroenterologist.  That way you'll be ready with a list of questions that we/I can help you with.\\n\\nAt this point....what's your daughter's diet like?  Is she consuming foods that may cause more activity in her digestive tract that will cause more discomfort or more loose stool..etc.\\n\\nYou should consider for her to use fibre supplements to help bulk the stool...I use metamucil capsules, which I take after eating.  I started with one capsule a day for a week..then added.  I can explain that further if you're interested.\\n\\nAs well...I strongly suggest a good probiotic.  If your daughter indeed did have an infection from a bacterial imbalance or from a virus, her intestinal flora should be encouraged into a better balance.  I use Renew Life Ultimate Flora Critical Care...one a night before bedtime.  But for your daughter, there is one that's a bit higher dosage..I can find the name if you're interested.\\n\\nI'm pleased your daughter will be sent to a GI doc....I do hope she doesn't have UC or CD....but sometimes triggers such as infection can set it into motion.\\n\\nThe Asacol will help deal with the inflammation.\\n\\nLast question...what areas of her colon are affected?\\n\\nquincy\\nI have found out that some food can cause flare-ups. So i would keep a food diary to see if any food cause flare-ups and see about using prednisona to help get the flares under control.\\nThanks,  we have taken some things out of her diet or cut right back on things that have always caused some bloating and gas such as cheese.  I've also taken her off of the Asacol and it's replacement Salofalk the anti-inflammatories that caused severe side effects.  She takes acidophollus, yogurt and a product named Intestinew from the Health Hut.  Her symptoms are under control but not in remission.  She can now cope and is not in any pain.  Eventually we are hoping that with continuted natural treatments and healthier diet she will go into remission or be rid of it perminantely assuming it's only Infectious Colitis instead of Ulcerative.\\nSorry it happend to her at 14.  It happened to me (I'm 24) this past spring.  Mine is mild but I do get flare ups once in a while, I take 3 asacols a day.  I figured I mostly have to stay away from fried foods.  Even if I have some chicken nuggets from mcdonalds I think that gives me gas and a small flare up.\\nMake sure she stays away from greasy foods.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'hello,\\n\\nI am not new to this forum, but I am new to this section.\\nI am a disabled cop, and have been battling chronic health issues for 5 years.\\n\\nI was just diagnosed with colitis. after some rectal bleeding and discomfort, I had a colonoscopy and the report came back with moderate colon inflammation. They took several biopsies, but told me they came back negative for both Ulcer colitis and crohn\\'s. Now I am confused. I keep reading colitis is one or the other, but so far I seem to be in a grey zone with neither?\\n\\nI have mucus, blood, bloating, gas, cramping, and worse of all, I get these spastic colon attacks where diarrhea comes on strong, causing me to strain uncontrollably, sometimes for hours. This has caused me to tear and get a fissure, along with a hemmroid. I am in a ton of pain. I can\\'t even leave the house and run errands much.\\n\\nI am going to try Asocal and Rewasa ( think that\\'s what it is called) but I am nervous about the drugs. I never react well to medication ever since I have been chronically ill.\\n\\nanyone have any advice or input for me?\\nthanks\\nHi...colitis is a general term for colon inflammation.  nothing more.\\nBiopsies don\\'t state a diagnosis, just that they\\'re consistent with whatever.\\n\\nDid you have stool samples done as well?\\n\\nDo you have a copy of your pathology results?  if yes...would you mind to state the findings?\\n\\nYou are on a medication for an inflammatory bowel disease...and I\\'m very impressed it\\'s both oral and rectal.\\n\\nI\\'ve used Asacol and Salofalk (same as Rowasa) for over 24 years.  Unless you\\'re allergic to it, you\\'re on one a very good medication that should help deal with the inflammation, and your symptoms will change/improve. Hopefully it won\\'t take you too long to feel normal again...have patience.\\n\\nAsking your doctor for a prescription of an antispasmodic will help...I use dicyclomine (started with 10mg).\\n\\nYou do need to make another list of questions for the doctor to answer. hang tough, it takes a while to get it all figured out.\\n\\nq\\nno, they never took stool samples. Everything I read says inflammation of colon is either caused by crohn\\'s or UC. I find it odd that I don\\'t have either according to my doctor. Unless of course I can have non specific colitis.\\nYou NEED to get a copy of the biopsies results.\\n\\nThere are many reasons for \"colitis\" that would mimic UC or CD....\\n\\nGet that copy.  You don\\'t have the answers you need/\\n\\nq\\ndo you guys find that rewasa or asocol helps? Are these generally well tolerated?\\nI\\'ve been asking the doctor to call me back. Im going to have to go in there I guess. He has the copies, and so far states is for sure colitis, however it may be early stages of UC. I want more info then that though. Do you guys find that Rewasa and asocol helps? are they well tolerated?\\nthe doc reviewed the biopsies and got the reports. he said its colitis, however it appears to not be UC or crohns. perhaps an early onset of UC. I will try to go in and see him for more info, he is not returning my calls. Do you guys find that Rowasa and asocol helps? are they well tolerated?\\nHi..you need to ask him to send you a copy of the pathology report.  It doesn\\'t matter what he says, you should have it for your research.\\n\\nI have UC, I\\'ve been on Asacol and Salofalk (just like Rowasa) for over 24 years.  Yes, it helps.\\n\\nq\\nthanks quincy, I\\'ll get a copy. Iwas curious is this is normal with colitis. Every now and then I get these severe episodes where I have these massive waves of bowl contractions. They come just like contractions, and they are strong. I end up on the toilet sometimes for hours. My stool comes out like ribbons, and it\\'s always lots of little ones, its never full or bulky. By the time they stop, im am left severely sore and in mass pain. The last time this happened to me, I began to develop a hemmroid because the strain was so bad. I try to not strain, but I have no control.\\nYes, it\\'s definitely a symptom of \"colitis\"....the term is tenesmus, and the ribbon stools are caused from tight rectum/sphincter and/or inflammation.  I call them white-knucklers, and that\\'s a huge distinguishing factor for flaring for me.\\n\\nAre you using the meds the doc gave you?\\n\\nPlease ask him for an antispasmodic.  It will help relax the spasming and give you some relief from the feelings.  It won\\'t help heal the inflammation.\\n\\nPlease let me know the results of the biopsies if you don\\'t mind writing them out..\\n\\nHang tough...you are on good medications...for any colon/rectal inflammation.\\n\\nq\\nI haven\\'t tried them yet.I was hoping to find a natural way to combat this. I don\\'t handle meds well, so I use them as a last resort.  I have hemorrhoids, an internal fissure, and colitis all at once, so I  I do have a full plate on my hands.\\n\\nI was looking into Nopal cactus to fight the inflammation and VSL#3 to balance the flora\\ndouble post\\ndon\\'t play too long without taking the meds....especially since you don\\'t officially know what you have.\\n\\nDefinitely let me know what the biopsies state...I\\'m very interested\\nq',\n",

Took some pills a while then got to where I didn't need them. About 12 years ago I was told I had ovarian cysts. I was told in the last 5 years or so I had uterine fibroids. Last year I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I also have high blood pressure, psvt, etc. fun right? Lol I had a scope last July with a dif doc and e said yeah you have colitis. It will take care of itself. The only reason I went to him was due to passing some blood and that was from internal hems.\\nWell. Feb 22 I noticed a change in bowel frequency, appearance, odor etc. feb 24 right side was sore and swollen. I had nausea and vomiting. I have had some fever. Weight loss. Pcp said it sounds like colitis. Put me on cipro and medronidazol those didn't help. Lon story short I seen my new gastro about 2 weeks ago. He told me that day it sounded like Ibd based on last year scope. He also said it sounded like my colon was full so he sent me for X-rays. Long story short after 4 rounds of X-rays, 4 preps, 5days of 3x a day milk of mag and mineral oil my colon FINALLY empties enough for scope. Gastro told my husband my colon was so full and problematic due to lorTab and norco I take for fibro however I haven't taken those in a long time.\\nThey did upper and lower today. They took 3 biopsies. Colon, duodenum and ilium I think. He said I had ibs... What happened to the ibd he said 2 weeks ago? Lol anyways he is sending me Monday for small bowel series follow through and also scheduling me for a geosaphageal manometry. Why I don't know. Why is he doing all these biopsies and other tests if its just ibs? My pcp is very concerned I have crohns or uc. Is it possible to have those and thy not show on the scope? Just not sure what to think. Please give me your thoughts!\\nIt is possible for biopsies to come back showing inflammation even if it can't be seen. My daughter had no visible inflammation in her stomach but biopsies showed a different story. Crohns can sometimes be hard to diagnose especially  if its in the small bowel.\\nGood luck with your tests\\nThanks. They did small bowel series yesterday and the nurse told me today that it was normal.. How can that be?! So where does that leave me? I'm so frustrated and so sick of being sick!

I have read about how pancreatitis and colitis can be related but would be interested in hearing from anyone who has experienced both.

However I had no pain whatsoever. My lipase levels were 4x higher than normal level, amylase not much. I had 2 ct scans, one with and without constrast. Ultrasound was normal. ER docs diagnosed me with acute pancreaititis. However my gastro think it was a fluke with no underlying cause. I tested for genes and all were negative.\\n\\nJust weird, that was 3 years ago.

You should see a gastroenterologist for diagnostic testing for celiac disease, malabsorption, possible gall bladder problems and to get treated for your viatmin deficiencies. Anemia is common in celiac disease from lack of iron absorption, so iron levels and blood count should be done as well.',\n",

       " {'post': \"I was diagnosed with Colitis in 2012, but I know I've had it for almost 2 decades.  The reason I finally broke down and went to the Dr was because of the pain.  I've been scoped from hither and yon, top to bottom, bottom to top.  My Colitis is at the top of my large intestine, and also at the bottom.\\n\\nDuring all of this, my common bile duct has been getting inflamed, I've been getting jaundice.  I'm on my 3rd temporary stent to keep the bile duct open.  ANYWAY...\\n\\nAfter I was diagnosed with colitis, my Dr. prescribed me a powder (apparently it's really just a binding agent for the gut) to keep me from running to the bathroom all the time.  That's it.  Nothing else.\\n\\nI don't see how this is helping my colitis at all.  I am having flares.  I have all but begged for something for the pain.  He said he didn't prescribe pain medication.\\n\\nI am constantly on the verge of going to the ER because of the pain.  But if I went every time I needed something for the pain, I'd be there every day for a couple of weeks.  (I get about a 2 week rest between flares currently.)  I'm not working right now, but I know if I were, I'd either be fired for not going in (because of the pain), or I'd have quit, to be able to stay home, it's really that bad.\\n\\nI feel just short of a junkie, the way I am wanting to get my hands on pain medication.  (The last time I took pain medication was 2 yrs ago when I broke my nose.)  I just need a break, but I hurt from the time I get up until I go to bed.\\n\\nIs it normal to be denied pain medication by your gastro dr?  This doctor is supposed to be the best in town, but I'm just not seeing it.\\n\\nI'd really appreciate some feedback.  I'm hoping I'm seeing this clearly, and not through biased eyes (because of the pain).\\n\\nThanks.\\nUC.\\nDo you take any meds for your colitis? If your not there should something you can try thats non narcotic,to control the colitis,and while the meds are starting to get in your system, you should get a little something for pain. Is the powder they gave you a bile binding resin? Not to mention if your running to the bathroom all the time,narcotics are know to cause constipation. I will say I've had numerous scopes..they find nothing..then I end up having my jpouch removed due to multiple fistulas and abcesses...keep trying, go to another doc...they dont always listen...and they dont always know...good luck..\\nThanks for replying.\\n\\nI'd have to look up the med online to know what it is.  All I know is he said it would keep me from running to the bathroom all the time.  My Dr tells me nothing.  He is treating me for an inflamed bile duct as well, and on my first ERCP he put a stint in and didn't even tell me until a month later when I saw him again.  Every time I see him I have to get a new stint (literally every time), which is out patient, but it's almost starting to feel like a game.  He is all over the situation with the common bile duct and totally ignores my colitis.  I pretty much get the feeling that he sees it as my problem, deal with it.  It's like, oh, you're in pain.....gee that's gotta suck....now let's get you a new stint.\\n\\nMy husband is the most level-headed person I know, so I pretty much bounce everything off him, and he thinks ignoring my pain has gone on way too long.  He's less than thrilled that my flares are not being treated at all.  Of course I am too.  I just want to check around and see if anyone else is having to deal with the pain on their own.\\nGo to a new doc!! If your not treating the colitis you could really be doing some damage. There a lot of meds you can try to alleviate the flairs..you don't have to live like that. I had to have an illestomy done, and I can say my life is %100 better, but that is extreme..last resort of course.\\n\\nRemicade\\nAsacol\\nEntocourt\\nPrednizone- however it is the devil..I don't suggest it unless totally necessary!\\n\\nHave you tried any of these? If not, ask or get in to see someone else.\\nI saw the best doc in STL, and he completely missed my abscesses and fistulas..missed completely. I don't know about your bile duct, but a Cholecystectomy- gallbladder removal fix the problem? Plus they need to find out why the stents are necessary....don't keep putting a band-aid on it..\\nPlease let us know what happens, get down and dirty with him..hes not god!!\\nI've never been given any of those medications.  He's never mentioned anything to me about my colitis other than I have it and that's why I've been passing black 'stuff'.  (I still do.  I pass red blood as well, which tells me I'm bleeding from both the upper and lower parts of my bowel, where my colitis is located.)\\n\\nI had my gallbladder removed eons ago at quite a young age.  I did have a stone last year and it was removed, but the problem with the duct continues.\\n\\nAs far as I can tell, no, my dr is not treating my colitis in any way.\\nAs for the stents, I agree, and have for quite some time that we are treating the symptom and not the problem.  I have really come to feel that I am just making car payments for this doctor.\\n\\nI still have a stent in me and have not been back in almost 4 months, and the stents are supposed to be changed out once a month.  I'm just sick of this revolving door of one stent after another, a guaranteed new stent every time I see him.  If I see him on a Thursday, he'll have me in the hospital literally the next day for a new stent, guaranteed.  So far he has no idea why my bile duct is getting inflamed.  He's not done anything to find out the why of it either.\\n\\nI will let you know what happens.  My husband is almost angry over all of this.  I've been feeling like if this is all there is to it, then I need to see a pain management doctor, because my GI talks like it's just something I have to live with.  He's given me a diagnoses and nothing more.\\nGet to your primary...get a cbc right away...blood in the stool is dangerous stuff...demand something be done...if u are activly bleeding,and the doc is ignoring u...hes a bad doc..u must feel like total crap..I was 10 when i had alot of blood in my stool..so i didnt it was bad...my hemolgobin was a 6...traumatic low...please make someone help u!\\nHi...the reason you're having your bile duct problems is because you probably have Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis...it's a secondary disease that can be associated with UC.\\nIt was thought that I have either that or PBC (Primary biliary cirrhosis), neither of which are a good diagnosis. The doc is leaning more to PBC as per blood testing and the MRCP.\\n\\nMy belief is that if the UC is nicely dealt with flare-wise, the PSC or PBC will hopefully stay in a fairly non-active state.\\nI'm also on a medication called URSO...it's a bile acid.\\n\\nYou should be on a medication to deal with your UC...an oral mesalamine AND rectal.  What country are you in?\\nWhen you say your UC is also at the top...I'm assuming that's the cecum?\\n\\nYou need to get to see another doctor asap...one who can set you up with at least the FIRST LINE medications and deal with your UC.  Pain meds won't do a darned thing except help with the pain a bit...\\n\\nAs well, you could ask the doc for an antispasmodic.\\n\\nHave you had blood tests done as well...do you have copies?\\n\\nYep, you need a new specialist asap....\\n\\nq\\nI'm in the US.\\n\\nI'm not getting medication for the bile duct flares either.  He's not prescribed anything but the powder to stop me from running to the bathroom all the time.\\n\\nI've been up all night.  Both the colitis and the common bile duct are flaring, so it's pain on the left (colitis) and pain on the right (CBD).  I am so miserable.  Trying to be tough...but this is just so rough.  I can tolerate a LOT of pain, but this just isn't letting up.\\n\\nI don't know what the cecum is.  I was told the colitis was at both the top (beginning) and the bottom of my large intestine.  To be honest, I've not studied up enough on any of this.  What I have learned is nothing compared to what you know.  I haven't taken this seriously enough because my GI has pretty much shrugged it off, and I thought I should too.  I thought he was telling the truth when he said this is just something you live with.  I wouldn't have found this place if I hadn't been searching for information of pain relief.  I have really felt like I was just being a wimp, that everyone else lives with this...and that I just needed to adjust to a higher level of pain.  But that's hard to do when flares come every two weeks and stay for two weeks.  I'm starting to buckle from it.  (I am the only girl and youngest in my 'family', and grew up being called weak and a wimp, so I've always tried to 'tough it out', but I guess that's really more for the PTSD board (recently diagnosed)....I feel like I'm getting a one-two punch without a chance to catch my breath!)\\n\\nI've had so many blood tests that I've lost count.  But it was always to check my liver enzymes, to see if I was jaundiced.  (I guess looking like a banana wasn't proof enough?)  I know that's what every test was for, because I always asked the nurses each time to be sure.\\n\\nI asked my husband again to PLEASE find me a new doctor ASAP.  I feel like my whole stomach is one big hot coal.  And I do get fever with this quite often.  I really feel this doctor has led me down the garden path.  More money for him I guess.\\n\\nI want the inflammation and the pain gone, or at least reduced to a level I can better tolerate.\\n\\nThanks.\\nOh, I don't have any copies of anything.  Just bills we're trying to stay ahead of.\\n\\nI just read up on Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis.  <--  Does the outcome mean what I think it does?  I'm angry that this doctor has not addressed this in any way.  He's never even talked to me about any of it.  It's ALWAYS just about getting a new stent until the inflammation decides to go away.  He seems so perplexed over the CBD situation.  Like he just has no idea what the problem could be, but a stent would be a great help!  I feel so let down.  And stupid.\\n\\nI guess my next doctor will get to remove/replace the stent I still have in.  Maybe he will let me choose which hospital I want my procedures done at.  My current GI always opted for the older more archaic hospital.  I got to choose the first time and I chose the newer better staffed and better equipped hospital.  He was not happy.  (I am sure it must cut into his profit if he has to pay higher fees to use the equipment at the newer hospital.)\\n\\nThe word 'bamboozled' comes to mind right now.\\nHi...I think what's needed for you is to initially go to the doctor and get copies of ALL the testing results of\\n1) blood tests\\n2) ERCP findings\\n3) colonoscopy biopsies\\n4) where exactly is the inflammation at both ends and the exact extend of the severity.\\n\\nAs well, you need to get definitive diagnosis if you have UC or Crohn's.\\nThere is a form of UC that affects the cecum (the junction at the colon and terminal ileum).\\n\\nYou need to demand medications for your UC.  The continuing inflammation is not good, and your doctor is ignoring your basic needs as a UC patient.\\nI would suggest initially Asacol and Rowasa retention enema.\\n\\nYou do need to get to another GI. But you need to be fully informed of what's going on in your body.\\n\\nRegarding the continuing inflammation in your CBD..It is possible it's an isolated incident, but initially you need to make sure that you're in control of the knowledge of what's going on.\\n\\nContinuing ERCPs aren't good either, they can set you up for further side effects such as pancreatitis and further infection in the liver.\\n\\nI'm really not trying to scare you.  But you have been a victim of this doctor who seems to have an attitude that you don't need to know anything.  It's time for you to create a different scenario.\\n\\nMake more appointments and get the information in your hands...on paper.  That will allow you to do the research and formulate questions to get more answers.\\n\\nq\\nDefinitely get a new GI!\\n\\nI don't know much about the bile duct stuff but I do know about pain management.\\n\\nThey are cracking down on doctors prescribing pain killers for anything but cancer. My doctor even legally had to give me a speech about it, basically they are being watched very carefully by the regulators for how/when/why/what they prescribe. The government is doing this in response to those who are abusing the pills. Unfortunately, IBD isn't a common problem and people underestimate the level of pain it causes. I don't know anyone who has IBD that would willingly want to take pain pills if they didnt absolutely have to because they agitate your stomach even more.\\n\\nI was in the same boat as you, in horrible pain for hours in the bathroom every other week for several days at a time. It would get to the point to where I couldn't bare it. I didn't want to go to the ER because I literally couldn't get off the toilet long enough and didn't want to wait 6 hours in a disease infested waiting room to be told its a flare. But I had to several times.\\n\\nI finally got prescribed Vicodin, but that made me super nauseous and felt like it was burning a hole in my esophagus. Then I would be constipated and the whole cycle would repeat. I finally said I couldn't do Vicodin anymore, I was only taking a half a tablet anyway but at least it let me leave the bathroom for the night. It was a damned if you do even more damned if you don't situation.\\n\\nSo an ER doc prescribed me tramadol which helped a lot more because it was less strong. But it also made me constipated. Finally the third time I was in the ER I was prescribed Percocet which killed the pain and didn't make me constipated. For some reason? I only need one very low dose, like 5mg or even a half of a tablet and I'm able to get out of the bathroom for the night. Then I'm not constipated and my body doesn't get into a viscous cycle. I was prescribed only 10 and that was 2 months ago and I've only used 2. More importantly, no ER visits and no pain every 2 weeks. The pill helps me get through the night and go to an appointment with my GI instead of having to go to the emergency room.\\n\\nSo my advice would be to ask if you can have a low dose, low amount of a painkiller (theyre different for everyone, but percocet worked best for me) that you can try at home during a flare so you can get through the night to see the doctor in their office to assess the symptoms.\\n\\nHope this helps.\",\n",

It also rarely (2%) of patients can get a lupus-like reaction to Remicade. This could cause hair loss, severe fatigue, joint pains, pleurisy, bad aching pain in extremities, etc. If you have any of these other symptoms, I would notify your Dr, and ask to get an ANA and anti-histone antibodies checked on blood. If positive, Remicade is usually stopped and something else done for the Crohn's.\\nremember biologic meds like remicaide, humira, cimzia and many others are chemo drugs so yes hair loss is a side effect\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi all,\\n\\nFor the past two months, I have been having moderate to severe abdominal pain, blood and mucus in my stool, alternating diarrhea and constipation, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea. At first I thought it was my appendix, though it was not showing up on a CT scan. I had my appendix removed just before Christmas due to some inflammation, but the pathology report showed that it was normal. That led me to a GI, to investigate the possibility of IBD or Celiac. Prior to my appointment with the GI, my blood tests for Celiac came back negative and my CBC showed anemia. I started on iron and vitamin c supplements to help with that. My GI ran more comprehensive blood tests, looking for inflammation or deficiencies, as well as a stool sample test. I found out today that all of my tests came back normal. I will be having a colonoscopy soon, but I have some questions.\\n\\nIs it likely that I could have Crohn\\'s or Ulcerative Colitis but still have normal blood tests? I am really confused about how my stool tests could come back normal, since there was definitely blood and mucus in my sample. I have also had an abdominal x-ray, as well as the CT scan, but neither test showed anything. I know that the colonoscopy is necessary to confirm a diagnosis, but does it seem like my symptoms could mean IBD? To provide a little more information: I am a 23 year old female, and have had what I was told was \"mild IBS\", which to me means a sensitive stomach and occasional bouts of diarrhea that go away by itself. I have normal periods, though I did have ovarian cysts in the past, which leads me to think that this is not endometriosis. I experienced frequent fatigue and dizziness before all of this started, but have not found any causes. I have had very little appetite during the past 2 months, but am trying to eat as much/as well as I can. I have been keeping a food/symptom journal but have not found any connections. The pain started out mostly in my lower abdomen, especially near my navel, but recently I have also had pain under my ribcage.\\n\\nThanks for reading, and for any advice or answers!\\nBlood and mucus in the stool does occur with IBD, but also with infections, and sometimes for no identifiable reason. Stool specimens are checked for infection, so a normal result just means no parasites or bacterial infections. Inflammation doesn\\'t always show up on blood tests, but being anemic indicates a problem with iron absorption or sufficient blood loss in the stool to drop your red cell count. The fatigue and dizziness is likely from the anemia. Some episodes like this turn out to be a \"non-specific colitis\" which goes away on its own. If inflammation is found on colonoscopy it would be called colitis. Crohn\\'s affects the small bowel (end of ileum, last portion of small bowel) and may require a small bowel follow-thru xray to detect it.\\nThanks for your response, ladybud. Since I last posted, I have had a sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy and upper endoscopy. The GI found focal active colitis in the sigmoidoscopy and some inflammation in my esophagus during the other scopes, but neither of those GIs think that is significant. I saw another GI, a specialist in IBDs, last week and he is going to look at all of my biopsies himself, but he said that because my bloodwork and scans have all been normal so far, it is probably IBS. Obviously it would be great if I don\\'t have Crohn\\'s, but I\\'m not convinced because of some of my symptoms, like continuous rectal bleeding (no one has found the cause yet, though I had some small internal hemorrhoids cauterized), anemia, some vitamin deficiencies (have improved since I started taking supplements), weight loss, etc... The new GI is trying some new meds with me: Bentyl, Citrucel, Align, and Prilosec, so I guess I\\'ll wait and see how that goes. But do these symptoms sound like IBS? Should I push my doctor to do an MRI, small bowel follow through, or other tests? Has anyone experienced normal CT scans and mostly normal scopes but still been dx\\'d with IBD?\\n\\nThank you!\\nI was misdiagnosed with IBS for a year before being diagnosed with crohns colitis, crohns limited to the large intestine. I had blood and mucus, went through all the tests except a colonoscopy and was told I had IBS and that the blood was from hemorroids. Finally I ended up in the ER after a year of symptoms and was properly diagnosed.\\n\\nEight years later I have blood and mucus, redid all the tests and they are all negative for inflammation and again its blamed on IBS. But this time they can see scarring in my intestines (pseudo polyps) that is proof I do have crohns so they diagnosed me with both. If I didn\\'t have scars they would probably say I don\\'t have crohns.\\n\\nIt\\'s a long path to diagnosis and you still have to fight for it once you do get it but u have to insist that they keep looking. Once they see IBS they assume its IBS and not IBD. If you switch GI doctors, they all want to \"take a look for themselves.\" The one test that did turn positive was PANCA, it\\'s an IBD antibody panel. If you haven\\'t done it I suggest you ask for it. It helps argue against IBS. And only take tests when feel bad because they will refer to them every time even though you may feel different than you did that day.\\n\\nAs for what to do in the meantime, keep trying different medicines until you find something that works. Bentyl I find works if I am going a lot. Painkillers just make me constipated and worse later. Lomotil works for if you must get through something without using the bathroom, events car rides and such. Heating pads help at times, so do moist wipes.\\n\\nTo me, it doesn\\'t matter as much what I eat only no dairy, low fiber and smaller meals. They kept telling me to add fiber, which always makes me worse. Listen to your own body though.\\n\\nI can\\'t seem to figure out how to tell the IBS from IBD in my own body. Sometimes I feel horrible and they say its IBS. Then I feel not as bad and they say my blood tests are elevated. It\\'s literally a crapshoot.\\n\\nHold on and keep fighting for answers. It does feel better when they give you a proper diagnosis because you don\\'t feel like its all in your head. You want to be like \"I told you something was wrong!\" Hope you figure it out soon.\\nI do hope you have been tested for celiac disease which causes malabsorption and can be assoc with IBD\\nThank you both so much for your posts. I was tested for celiac and both the blood test and biopsy came back negative. I have tried several anti-spasmodics, which didn\\'t work and gave me some bad side effects, and my GI is now talking about trying anti-depressants for the pain. I\\'m hesitant to try that, since I\\'m already on meds for depression and anxiety and don\\'t want to change the delicate balance it took me so long to find. The rectal bleeding has gotten a little better, after using hydrocortisone suppositories, but everything else is still persistent or worsening. I\\'m seeing my primary care doctor again tomorrow to talk about testing for some other autoimmune conditions, since my fatigue, dizziness, night sweats, etc. have been a problem that the GIs haven\\'t addressed. I\\'ll ask about the PANCA antibody panel--I don\\'t think I\\'ve done any of those tests yet. I just don\\'t know if I should stick with my current GI or try another one--I understand that they haven\\'t found anything in my scans, colonoscopy, or endoscopy, but I\\'m just not confident that IBS explains everything. I\\'m so tired of this whole process--I haven\\'t worked in months and barely leave my bed--but I\\'m going to keep fighting for a diagnosis! Thanks again for all of the help.\\nI was so happy to read your post this evening but not so happy for you.  As I too myself am going through the very same situation but for the last three years and I still have yet to be diagnosed properly.\\n\\nI had a bowel resection in 2010 and was hospitalised numerous times after than and most recently has a blockage and surgery in Oct 2012 and a vulvulus in November 2012 and another surgery.\\n\\nBloods too come back normal most of the time and stool samples and it\\'s so frustrating.  Because like you I\\'m having night sweats, mouth ulcers, diarreah and constipation, mucus, and absolute fatigued out of it.  I used to live in Bahrain and was diagnosed there with Crohns and since I moved to Dubai they have again gone back to IBS.  I just came out of hospital after been admitted for two weeks and was given pethadine only and nothing else and I decided to change doctors again as I was made to feel like I am going crazy in the head.  My GI at the time insisted it was nerve ending pain from all the surgeries and I had a lumber sympathetic block last week.  Needless to say it didn\\'t work.  I have gone to another new GI and I started on Pentasa on Saturday.\\n\\nDon\\'t give up, keep going until you get a reply and a diagnosis.  We ourselves know our own bodies and we know what we feel is incorrect.  Its so frustrating when doctors brush us off with the IBS diagnosis when you know deep down inside something else is truly going on.\\n\\nLet me know how you get on and am sure we will all get thru this\\n\\nThanks for your response Juanie. I\\'m really sorry you\\'re struggling--I hope the Pentasa works. I\\'m currently trying Amitriptyline for the pain, though it\\'s still too early to see results. My primary care doctor told me to see an endocrinologist rather than testing my adrenal function herself, and also didn\\'t know anything about IBD specific antibody panels. I\\'m not sure if I want to ask my GI about it--she is so focused on it being IBS only. In the meantime I\\'m crossing my fingers and trying not to stress too much. Thanks for the reassurance--I will certainly update if I get news!',\n",

One question I have is when do I need to go to the hospital? Is this life threatening? I called my doc but he said im probably just backed up. I would hate to ignore an issue that needs hospitalization.\\n\\nthanks guys\\nYour symptoms are very charachteristic of Crohn's, and I find it hard to believe your Dr dismissed this as just constipation. The asachol should definitely help, but it will take awhile, like days to weeks depending on how bad the inflammation is. Is your Dr a GI specialist? If not, you certainly need one, and need aggressive treatment. I would ask for a GI antispasmodic for the cramps. I would also ask for a dietician's consult to go over dietary aggravants to avoid right now and in future. You might find it helpful at the beginning to keep a food journal to track what foods might make it better/worse, but right now, a soft. low fiber bland diet would be best, and the dietician can go over specifics with you. Asachol is an anti-inflammatory agent, and will be needed long term for prevention of flares. Prednisone is sometimes used initially to get the inflammation under control quickly and I would ask your Dr about that. Let him know about the bloody, ribbon-like stools and severe pain so he knows how miserable you are with this. Crohn's can cause very serious complications and shouldn't be treated lightly.\\nSorry, I should be more clear. Blood marker tets confirmed I have crohn's. My DR is a GI specialists.\\n\\nI called the on call Dr last night because of the intense and forced bowl movements. The pain was severe as well. The Dr on the phone said he didn't think it was an ER issue, and that he thinks I am backed up, most likely because of inflammation, and now its forcing its way out.\\n\\nI have Rewasa as well, however he wants me to wait for an X-ray of the bowel to make sure there are no obstructions before I stick an enema stem up there.\\nSo, let me get this straight.  your doc initially said colitis, but no UC or CD.  Now a blood test says CD?\\nTo be truthful...there's NO blood test that can be definite about CD or UC.\\n\\nWhere exactly in the colon is your inflammation...and didn't he recently do a c-scope?  The ribbon stools are classic of rectal inflammation.\\n\\nWhat's the dosage of Asacol? 800mg pills?  How many daily?\\n\\nI'd put off the prednisone until you've tried the 5ASA (mesalamine) oral/rectal.\\n\\nFor cramping, you can ask your doc for an antispasmodic...I use dicyclomine which helps a lot.  But for now, your cramping would probably be because of no treatment and continuing inflammation.\\n\\nDo you have a copy of your results as of yet...and the blood tests as well?  If not, I urge you to have them for your records and research.\\n\\nq\\nyes, I do have the labs. At first, they said the biopsies were inconclusive, but I for sure had colitis of some sort. This was evident. My doctor sent out my blood to a specialty lab called Prometheus IBD SGI  Diagnostic. They ran my blood checking for markers, i.e. specific antigens.  The results came back consistent and positive for Crohns.\\n\\nBased on the Colonoscopy report, showing my colon inflamed, and the the blood marker test, I was diagnosed with Crohns Colitis.\\n\\nI asked how accurate these test are, and he assured me they were about 95% accurate, and felt it was clear based off what he was seeing. He said I could do another Colonoscopy, but that would be unnecessary hardship in his opinion.\\n\\nI tried Rewasa last night, and had a bad reaction to it. I just left the hospital. I can pretty much say with certainty that I am intolerant to mesaline. I had watery diarrhea all night after taking the suppository along with nausea. Then, I began to run a fever and feel weak and dizzy. I went to the ER scared I had an infection in the GI track. While there, a few hours later, my fever went away. They gave me no fever reducer while I was there, only saline and some anti nausea medication.\\n\\nAll of these are listed in the the medication side effects, and only came on after taking it, then the fever left after a few hours of coming on.\\nI think you're jumping to an ultimate conclusion about the intolerance to mesalamine....could have been a coincidence, but it would be good for you to try it again.\\n\\n\\nHow much asacol are you taking?\\n\\nIs the Rowasa 4g or 2g dosage?\\n\\nThe Prometheus is NOT a 95% positive regarding diagnosis....I talk to a LOT of people who have had it done with multiple results, there are doctors and medical institutions who refuse to use it.\\n\\nBUT....you do have an IBD, regardless if it's CD or UC, you will need medications.  I'm not saying you don't have CD.....but with the doctor's statements initially, and for him to rely on the Prometheus, I think you actually need another opinion.\\n\\nI urge you to try the rectal mesalamine again when you're more settled, but in the meantime, ask your doc for you to try a steroid enema to help get the rectal/sigmoid inflammation under control.\\n\\nWhere exactly did it state your inflammation is located...throughout your colon?\\n\\n\\n\\nq\\nit seems to be only in my colon, however Im starting to get pain in my lower right abdominal quadrant, and just left of my belly button as well. I guess I could always go to a second doc.\\n\\nI find it odd that as as soon as I took the 4gram dose of rewassa, I got cramping, nausea, water diarrhea, and then a fever. I then got very weak and dizzy.  I thought the fever could have been an infection so I went to the ER. about 2 hours later, the fever went away on its own, no drugs. Blood came back normal with no signs of fever, and CT showed inflammation in the colon, but that's it. The pain on the lower right radiates to my lower right back as well.\\n\\nAfter not taking any more Rewassa, I have no more diarrhea, but I do have urgency with little to no stool, and mucus.\\n\\nThe prednisone they want me to take is of great concern for me, because I have had under performing adrenals with low cortisol in the past, and often do not handle steroids well. I could look into hydrocortisol suppositories, although that can give me similar issues....\\nAre you still taking the asacol?\\n\\nq\\nno, I tried the rewassa first, but stopped after the bad reation. Im not going to take oral mesilamine when I had a bad reaction.\\nAnyone have any luck with VSL#3?\\nI know of a lot of IBDers who use VSL#3...some continue to use it, others have switched to other probiotics.  For me, I'd not use the powder, I'd try the capsules first.  I'd also take them on an empty stomach at night and not during the day...reason for me would be discomfort, and I've read that they're better to take on an empty stomach during a quiet time (which would be sleep).\\n\\nBut the opinions vary....trial and more trial...\\n\\nEveryone should be on probiotics...but not all people's body agree with all probiotics strains.\\n\\nKeep us posted on how you do on them.\\n\\nq\\nthanks for the input quincy, so far I have only taken two a day, and I handle it fine. I guess I should increase the dose. how many do you take?\\nI use different probiotics, not the VSL#3.  You're using 2 packs daily?  I think the dosage for flaring is 4 packs daily?  At least that's what I read from others.\\n\\nWhat other changes have you made regarding diet?  I would also suggest adding a fibre supplement with your meals (start slow)...that can help feed the probiotics nicely as well).\\n\\nKeep me posted how it goes.\\n\\nq\\nI have been taking two pills daily, but it sounds like I need to up that....bottle said 2-8 so I figured I would start low. I am also going to try Apriso, perhaps I will handle it better then Rewassa. I know this is a long shot, but I am also considering Nopalea. Its a natural anti-inflammatory from the prickly pear cactus.\\nYes, it's a longshot, it won't replace the meds. If it was a help or replacement, we'd all know about it.  But it won't hurt you unless you're allergic to it.  You might get gas or discomfort...change the time of the day of when you take it to see if you do before you stop taking it.\\n\\nThe Apriso won't treat the rectum, but you could ask the doctor to try suppositories...they're not as effective, but at least you'll treat the rectum.\\n\\nI'm not totally convinced regarding the Rowasa, I think you should give it another try.  The other thing is that you might be sensitive to the sulfite as preservative.  There's a sulfite free version as well.\\n\\nNow, why am I trying to convince you to continue on the 5ASA meds you might be asking?  There's evidence they help protect the colon from cancer/precancer.  If you have continuing low level inflammation for a long period of time, it's not a good thing.\\n\\nThe two pills daily of VSL#3 is a good initial plan, and yes...best to start with a lower dosage...when does it say to take them?\\n\\nAre you having any discomfort with them at this time?\\n\\nq\",\n",

For the past six months I have experienced the following\\n\\nExtreme fatigue\\nWeightloss (I think from not eating very much due to feeling full quickly)\\nSlow digestion\\nLoss of appetite\\nSevere constipation (I can go well over a week and when I do go it's awful!)\\nMuscle pain and joint pain\\n\\nI've had a ct scan which has shown nothing too.\\nMany thanks\\nhave you had a colonoscopy?\\n\\nHave you had blood tests done....and do you have copies of the results?\\n\\nq\\nNo it's the one thing I haven't had done though I have had blood tests but for quite a lot of things and I have had a ct scan. What normally shows up in blood tests? Many thanks\\nThose are the exact symptoms I had and I was eventually diagnosed with Crohn's. Under went blood tests, then a ct scan but ultimately had to get a colonoscopy though. It's the only way to ultimately diagnose it, you have to get a colonoscopy so they can take biopsies and check for anything else.\\nESR and CRP are usually done to monitor crohns disease....but then these can be raised from any inflammation in the body so the best way to diagnose crohns is a colonoscopy with biopsies.\\nChrohn's usually causes diarrhea, right lower quadrant pain, blood and mucus in stools, cramping, sometimes low grade fever. Your symptoms are, IMO, not typical of Chrohn's. Have you been tested for celiac disease caused by gluten intolerance? It can be tested by blood tests or upper endoscopy with biopsy. I would consider that a more likely possibility. It also causes malabsorption of nutrients, particularly iron, causing anemia, and Vit and mineral deficiencies, like D, A, calcium. Those levels can be checked as well in blood.\\nConstipation is not a typical symptom of Crohn's, as most suffer from diahrea.  That is why for a long time I doubted that I had Crohn's.  But after I had a colonoscopy it was shown that I do have Crohn's.  It's not as common, but some patients do suffer from constipation instead, that is what my GI doc said.\\nconstipation would usually be caused by limited inflammation in the rectum.  Is that where yours is Greengal?\\nSince Crohn's can happen anywhere from mouth to anus with multiple areas, it could very well depend on which areas are tending to be inflamed and active.  As well, it can also depend on what medications one's using, how much food intake, etc.\\n\\nHazel, the only way that your doc will actually see what's going on is with a c-scope.  While other testing methods may see inflammation or thickening of areas in the digestive tract, it can't guarantee what's going on.\\n\\nEven c-scopes with biopsies cannot sometimes determine an exact diagnosis of CD or UC...it's usually through a process of elimination (other possible culprits such as STD, microscopic colitis, Celiac), blood testing for certain markers/inflammatory markers, anemia, diverticulitis, cancer, etc.\\n\\nIf the doc suspects UC or CD, the results will come back consistent with, not a definitive.  If all is eliminated of the other possibilities, the result is usually CD or UC.\\n\\nPlease keep us posted of the process to get diagnosed.  We might have some other suggestions for questions to ask the doc, etc.\\n\\nq\\n\\nMy Crohn's is actually in my terminal ileum and first section of my small intestines.  Which as I was told is the most common location for it.  But it took a long time and lots of different diagnostic tests to finally diagnose it since my symptoms were never your text book case of Crohn's. I've never really had diarrhea or much bleeding, which I know are the most common symptoms.\\n\\nMy biggest symptoms have always been severe constipation and nausea.  And then when I am able to have a BM it comes out in huge amounts but its all solid. So not having your typical symptoms caused a lot of missed diagnosis for me and continued trouble for years.\\n\\nIt wasn't until I had a colonoscopy last year, where they were able to really see up there and take biopsies that my Crohn's was finally diagnosed.  My GI doc said that not everyone presents the same, every case is different and usually needs to be managed differently. Right now I'm on a regimine of 2 Pentasa 3 times a day, fish oil, b12, calcium, probiotics, fiber supliments, and ginger for the nausea. I've also cut out dairy and am working on going gluten free.  I still have some bad days, but I've got some good one too and things have not gotten worse.  So I think I'm doing ok.  But it took a while to get here.\\nGreengal...Interesting...The Pentasa should help with the terminal ileum, but probably won't help if it's at the beginning of your small intestine..or do you mean at the beginning of the ileum (it will cover that area as well)\\nHave you been checked for celiac disease as well?\\n\\nBleeding isn't as common in CD as it is in UC, especially if it's affected farther into the digestive wall.\\n\\nYes, constipation isn't a common symptom with small intestine involvement unless there's blockage I would assume.  The fibre supplements will help with that as would probiotics.\\n\\nSometimes increasing vitamin C intake is helpful...at least for me it has been when I wanted to stay super regular when I was working full time..lol.\\n\\nJust as an aside...if you do have reflux as well...I've read that ranitidine (Zantac) also increases motility a bit...that might be helpful for you?  In effect that could help with nausea too.\\n\\nI have friends with CD, one who's had the terminal ileum removed.  Her major issue is diarrhea since missing that part doesn't slow down things at all.\\nI think having a slower moving system is better than constantly having to go. ah, there's never a happy medium sometimes.  But at least some meds/supplements can be helpful.\\n\\nIt's good you're using fibre supplements (which ones?) to keep things moving nicely, to help with exercising the digestive tract and to help flush out any invaders should they happen.\\n\\nSounds as though you're getting the hang of dealing with your CD without needing any of the big-gun meds.  Hopefully you won't need them ever!\\n\\nq\",\n",

There are diets that work for some like the SCD diet. Get the book breaking the vicious cycle it is worth the $.\\n\\nDepending how sever he has the symptoms are, this will dictate what he should be eating. If he is lactose intolerant he should obviously stay away from dairy, if he is not he should cut back to specific cheeses (in the book). I cut out Gluten, although it did not cause me issues it was not helping.\\n\\nHere are some foods that he should stay away from and some he should eat (http://www.*****.com/ibd-crohns-disease/ulcerative-colitis/creating-an-ulcerative-colitis-plan) - As far as a life style, don't change ....just be aware of the closest bathroom. I also tend to carry 2 Imodium in my wallet everywhere - just in case...\\n\\nA lot of this illness is mental, so you need to stay positive....is he on any meds?\\nThank you for your words of wisdom\\nHis dr. put him on Bentyl 20 MG and Asacol 400 MG.Been on these almost two weeks,and he says right after he takes the Asacol his stomach gets really upset.In your opinion is this about all the dr. can do?\\nMy Opinion does not mean much, I am not a doctor but Asacol did not make me feel good either, it made my stomach upset and it made me get hot flashes. I switched to Lialda and I tolerate it much better. It has allowed me to become more regular and it is a 24 hr slow release so you only take it in the morning with breakfast.\\n\\nI will tell you, I still get a little upset in the morning after breakfast, and especially after I go but this is a stomach/ colon illness so your have to expect some set backs.\\n\\nAlso my doctor made a point to tell me that this is a slow moving healing and that it is not a straight line, I am tired of it after 4 months I could not imagine the people who lived with this for years. Everyday I am concerned and it wears on me, and I am not used to that because I was a very confidant guy. So what I can tell you is that help your husband deal with this physical change by helping him deal with it mentally, because it takes its toll.\\nThanks for all your help in learning how to deal with this.His dr. didn't help with information.I hope things get better for you\\n\",\n",

Constipation seems to be the exact opposite of Ulcerative Colitis and I can't find much information from the internet. HELP me!\\nyes me!  ive never had diarrhea.  i was dxd last year in summer.  i think it means that the inflammation is in the lower end.  ie rectum anus.  the stool is already formed by the time it reaches there so it would be solid.  also if there inflammation higher up it would mess with the formation iykwim and cause diarrhea.  the constipation and blood is for the same reason.  inflammation in the lower end.  it means your colon is healed so its a positive, proctitis is harder to shift though.  can be very stubborn.  go easy on the laxitives and concentrate on some fibre and plenty of water.\",\n",

I'm 24 years old and I've been experiencing chronic abdominal pain in the upper right area of my abdomen, underneath my ribs for 3 months now. The pain is constant, and is accompanied with a lot of gurgling and a pressure that feels like there is a balloon inside. I haven't noticed any relation to anything I eat, it is pretty much constant, and I rarely have diarrhea. I have had almost every test done with inconclusive results, so I'm looking for any suggestions here.\\n\\nMy HIDA scan reported an ejection fraction of only 14%, but I have had two gastroenterologists tell me that my symptoms do not mimic common gallbladder issues and they do not believe it is the source of my pain. CT scans and ultrasounds have not shown any gallbladder stones or noticeable inflammation. The other tests that came back abnormal are a high bilirubin level in the blood (3.0 in the last test), a borderline low Vitamin B12 level, and a positive indicator on an IGG test. I have had an EGD, colonoscopy, and capsule endoscopy all of which did not find anything. With all of this, my gastroenterologist has diagnosed with me Crohn's disease and put me on Prednisone and Asecol HD medications. She admitted that Crohn's disease can sometimes be hard to diagnose and she can't confirm that is actually what is wrong with me.\\n\\nIs there enough evidence to be treated for Crohn's disease? Can it still be a gallbladder problem even though my symptoms aren't the same as the general gallbladder symptoms? What does a bilirubin level of 3.0 mean? Can my high blood pressure medicine, Bystolic, be related to any of this? My biliribuin was 0.9 in 2009 before starting BP medicine. Should I be doing more or just take the prednisone for the next 8 weeks? Any help or suggestions would be appreciated since I have had a few doctors testing me for months without anything conclusive.\\nI would get a second opinion before I started taking steroids and Asacol. It could be crohn's but with nothing showing on any of the test that is a reach in my mind. It would be like telling someone with a pulled muscle they have crohn's and starting tratment- she has the same amount of proof...\\n\\nGet a second opinion first, and ask your primary about the side effects of your pills. Also I assume that you have had your blood tested in the last three years while on the meds, ask your doctor to look at your levels over that time - see if they went up...\",\n",

       " {'post': 'How do you know that your in a non stop flare and how do you know if your not? I was really sick the week before thanksgiving, that I know was a flare....but after that my doctor said I was in recovery. Then Feb 28th and 29th I had a flare, I know because I had really loos muddy stool and I was worn out, since then I have felt a little better each day...\\n\\nAm I in a Non Stop Flare or did I go through two different flares. Another question I have is, I get a warm light pinching feeling in my mid left side - like a twitch....what is that?\\nsickinNj\\nI would of thought that being in a flare meant having symptoms however minor and the opposite was remission.  i would say your in a flare.  being totally symptom free is when you\\'re healed and in remission.  no blood mucous diarrhea gas.\\nThanks for the clarification, but even normal people get Gas and DH sometimes. So I guess if it is not happening consistently it is a good sign.\\n\\nI just hate the hot flashes, like I am a 60 yrs old woman. I get very warm - not fever. I walk around with a body temp of 96.7 normally (i know I am cold blooded...LOL) so when I get to 98.8 or so I feel very warm. I think it is the meds but my doctor thinks it is nothing to worry about. Does anyone else experience that- normally starts in my feet and then on my right side...\\nYeah, it is hard to figure out sometimes.  To me, \"in recovery\" is different than \"remission\".  In recovery means healing, on the mend, headed in the right direction, getting things under control.  Remission is completely symptom-free and on a stable maintenance drug.\\n\\nAlso, those of us who have had really bad flares in the past have traumatized intestines, which can often lead to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) even when we\\'re not flaring... IBS is pretty harmless, but the symptoms are almost identical.  So sometimes when I am in recovery, I still have some IBS symptoms that resemble my ulcerative colitis.  The only main symptom that I know is different between the two is blood.  If there is any blood involved, then I know for sure it is ulcerative colitis.  There is also blood test the doc can run called \"C Reactive Protein\" that measures the amount of inflammation in your body.  Normal is 0-9 (the lower the better).  When I was at my worst flare, my levels were right around 50, but when I\\'m pretty much in remission they are somewhere around 3.  So you know if there is a lot of inflammation, it is probably the disease.  If there is little to no inflammation, then it is probably just IBS.\\n\\nIt would be practically impossible for someone else over the web to be able to say whether you had a short remission or if you were flaring the whole time.  You would have to analyze your own symptoms and compare them to times you know you were in remission or before you got the disease.  It\\'s possible you may not ever be able to get a solid answer.  But we do know when our symptoms are bad or good, and which direction we want them to head...  Good luck with yours!\\n\\nAs for your other question... It depends on what meds you are on.  If it is just mesalamine (brand names Asacol, Lialda, Rowasa, Penasa), those are pretty harmless and shouldn\\'t be causing temperature changes.  But if you are on Prednisone or any immunosuppressants (Imuran, Remicade, Humira), then those could definitely affect your temperature, heart rate, etc.  The side-effects are not fun, but they are better than the disease.\\nYou didn\\'t double post....Don\\'t worry it was a good one, I would have read it twice. I take Lialda and Canasa, MY GI said he thinks that the hot flashes are nothing to be concerned about.\\n\\nI will say this, I have been on Canasa for 2 weeks - the first week I had some chills and D twice, since then (knock on wood) I have had consistent solid movements every morning. I take the Canasa right after so i do get some gas cramping, but that is because I think I am really cleaned out. My issue is I have never saw blood in the toilet, so I cant tell if I am flaring or just had a bad meal the night before.\\n\\nThis is not a bad thing, I don\\'t want to see blood. MY GI and my DR just took a ton of blood from me and stool and urine. They are looking to see if I have any other issues, or if my UC is being caused by any bacteria / infection. I just want to get healthy and would prefer not to take pills at all, because I am relatively younger (36) so taking pills everyday long term is going to cause some issues down the line...',\n",

Crohn\\'s has symptoms that are easy to brush off as other things.  Plus, the symptoms ie had we\\'re never your typical Crohn\\'s symptoms.  I never really had diarrhea or bloody stool.  My symptoms were sometimes severe constipation and often nausea.  I did have cramping and got gassy, but I am a female so I and other doctors always attributed the cramping to being \"female problems.\"\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t until last year when I suffered symptoms so severe that it about disabled me that I sought out a GI doc.  And after a barium CT scan, blood work, and a colonoscopy I was finally diagnosed with Crohn\\'s.  My doc put me on Pentasa and I\\'ve been working with a nutritionist.\\n\\nBut even now I still don\\'t have you typical Crohn\\'s symptoms.  I can go days at a time with no bowel movements at all, despite upping my fiber, eating healthier, and taking Miralax as directed.  And then a day comes when I swear 10 pounds of stool comes out, it just keeps coming and coming all in one day.  It\\'s like my body stores it up for days and then releases all at once.  And I spend the rest of the week feeling gassy and nauseated all over again.  That\\'s my cycle.  And it doesn\\'t seem that the medication or dietary changes I\\'ve made have helped.  I\\'m not really sure what to do at this point.  And given my unusual presentation of Crohn\\'s no professional I\\'ve seen really know how to help me, as the typical treatment advice given to Crohn\\'s patients doesn\\'t really seem to apply to me.\\n\\nI just know it\\'s very exhausting, frustrating, and it\\'s keeping me from having a life.  Any thoughts at all?\\nHi...I see we discussed this in the past.\\n\\nDo you not have any inflammation in the rectum?\\n\\nRather than the miralax, i\\'d suggest you maybe try another fibre supplement to help keep your colon functioning/exercising in a more natural rhythm.\\n\\nHow are you eating?\\nq\\n\\nNo, it\\'s actually in the terminal illeum according the colonoscopy I had 6 months ago.\\n\\nDue to the constipation issue I have been eating more fiber, both in the form of more fruits and veggies, but also fiberous cereals and grains as directed by my nutritionist.  I\\'ve also been using fiber suppliments.\\nMaybe consider asking your GI for a script of Bentyl (dicyclomine).  it\\'s an antispasmodic which could help.\\n\\nGood you\\'re eating fibres.  some,  however, could attribute to discomfort..it\\'s mostly a pick and choose based on comfort.\\n\\nHow much Pentasa are you on?  just curious.\\n\\nIt seems as though you have other issues rather than just CD...\\n\\nAre you using any probiotics?  That could help as well.\\n\\nq\\nI was diagnosed with Crohns in 1999 and since then the diagnosis varies between Crohns and Ulcerative Colitis... Now until the past 6 months I had the constant going going going problem. About 6 months ago I started getting constipation for days and days and then similar to you I would poop my guts out for 2-3 days... So hard to try and schedule anything. My new GI doctor said its possible and typical to also have IBS along with the crohns/ulcerative colitis. Which from what it sounds like could be what you have also but since you were diagnosed fairly recently it could be similar to mine.. My GI doctor told me to losen up on the fiber as I had upped it and she started me on Milk of Magnesia as well. This according to her and what I have read is safe long term and can help get your intestines \"working\" more regularly. I am still playing around with the dosage as what she said to take literally has me on the toilet all day everyday.. so I\\'m trying to \"fine tune\" everything.\\n\\nI would ask your GI about this since a lot of what I have read confirms what I stated above.

I eat salad almost daily, and romaine is a plus for me.\\n\\nThe pulling feeling...I would strongly suggest an antispasmodic for relieving the spasming.\\nIf your anus is sore, then an external ointment/preparation or even a hydrocortisone cream will help.\\n\\nYou should use the Canasa twice daily...\\n\\nSo, let me sum up that you've only been on rectal meds for a week?\\n\\nq\\nI take 2 Lialda every morning- I guess that would be 2.4 g - I was given instructions for 1 canasa a day- I don't think I should go away from what my GI tells me correct? I am going to add probiotics tonight. I just have to get a handle on this, the pull in my side is gone today but I had a lot of mucus in my stool today (formed not lose) but now my area around my anus (the but cheeks) feels soar and I have real light pinching in my stomach..... I feel like I just never have a good day.\\n\\nYou know I think this happened because I quite smoking, which has been linked to UC -some part of me wishes I never did. I take my meds, I don't eat bad and I just can not feel right...\\n\\nI lost an opportunity of a job with a great company last week, I was in the final interview and I felt so sick that I had to ask to go to the restroom while speaking to the CEO. They had already asked me when I could start and he was just giving his sign of approval.\\n\\nThey asked if I was alright and I told them I just ate something that upset my stomach, I made the mistake of telling them that I had UC, but it does not effect my work performance. All of a sudden the next day I got an email from the recruiter telling me they are going to continue there search....I know I lost it because of this crap and I am tired of living like this...\\nHi...it's unfortunate regarding the job opportunity lost because you were sick.  Try not to punish yourself.\\n\\nSmoking wouldn't have stopped you from getting UC or your quitting wouldn't have caused you to get UC.  It seems that smoking for some get control over symptoms.  Only you would know if you had any problems butt-wise while you were smoking...but ignored as just being normal.\\n\\nI, personally, think you're being undermedicated and believe that the retention enemas would be a better bet for dealing with your symptoms/rectal inflammation.\\n\\nIs there any reason you cannot call your doc and ask for them? or at the very least to ask for the prescription for the Canasa to be upped to twice a day?\\n\\nHaving UC totally sucks.  But...there are meds that can help.  You haven't learned yet how they can work for you and what other things you can add/change to help you feel better.\\n\\nA flare can leave you feeling absolutely dire...yours is mild at this point and focus on the part that you can most likely get this under control soon.  Try not to feel totally defeated at this point.\\n\\nYOU QUIT SMOKING!  That's a huge accomplishment and a great investment into your future health.  So, please keep a smile on your face for that.\\n\\nCall the doc...get him to call you back. Ask for stronger butt meds...and antispasmodics...I use dicyclomine and started with 10mg.\\n\\nAre you still doing the SCD?  How's that going?\\nq\\nI am trying to stay positive, but things like this morning happen. I got up this morning and exploded, worst D since my initial episode in November. I don't know if it was something I ate or the canasa. To be honest, I am worried about having a reaction to the canasa...the side effects are supposed to be bad gas and D, since I have been taking it I have had more D, mucus in my stool and cramps then I normally have and I pass wind constantly after taking it at night. All Air!\\n\\nI am not sure if this is working or hurting me, how can I ask to go higher. I am home today because I was so tired after 40 min in the bathroom this morning I could not get in the train. I was more scared to go to work than my stomach was upset....this thing has turned me into a whimp.\\n\\nI never got going on the SCD diet, it has too much Yogurt involved, I cant eat the Yogurt because I am lactose intolerant. I have not tried making my own Yogurt because I can find a Yogurt maker that stays on for 24 hrs....\\n\\nI am really lost, your right a year ago I would have written off the D this morning to the Gluten Free Pasta or the sauce, now that I know I have UC I panic that I am going to have to do 10 trips at work....even though I have not gone since.\\n\\nI am talking to my doctor today, I have to start to get a handle in this....\\nWere you able to talk to your doctor?\\n\\nAgain, can you tell me how long you've been on the Lialda, and how long on the Canasa?\\n\\nq\\nSorry Quincy _ April 5th was my birthday so I did not get back to you! 36 with the pooper of an 80 yrs old! Actually since the 29th I was fin until last wed when I had D bad in the morning. Since then I have been completely fine. I think that was because I had veggie soup and a salad on the 4th....too much fiber went right through me.\\n\\nI have now been in Canasa 2 weeks and it defiantly helps, the Lialda I have been taking since the end of Jan / start of February. I do still have bad days, like this morning...woke up from a dead sleep with the worst acid re-flux and upset stomach. Which was surprising because all I had for lunch was a grilled chicken wrap with L&T and dinner was salmon and W rice.....I think the Salmon is a consistent offender. That is the third time that i have had bad gas pains and upset stomach when eating salmon. I normally tied it back to the veggies I ate with it but the last 2 times it was white rice.\\n\\nSo no Salmon for me! I felt terrible all morning but I took my Canasa at 8:50 and now almost an hour later I feel better....I think it causes me to swell....\\n\\nI called my doctor last Wed, he just got back to me today (left me a message) - that said I am going to call him today and update him on my situation - + he took blood 2 weeks ago I want to see if he has the results....\",\n",

In October of 2011 I started getting constant back pain, I thought nothing of it....I thought is was an old sports injury acting up because of my new chair at work. I had just started a new job and the temp office was crap, and I might as well have been sitting on a wooden chair.\\n\\nThen right before Thanksgiving I woke up in the sweats and started getting the chills. That got progressively worse and I started having a fever spike, from there I had non stop D for 5 days - could not hold anything down. After about 5 days and an IV from my normal DR I was going normal, just a little lose. I went to my GI and had a the up and down scop done and that is what they came back with. Since December 21st 2011 I have not had D until this past 2 weeks.\\n\\nI have gone one time a day and somewhat formed, before canasa I would go a little heavy and dark but not watery. Now on Canasa I have gone formed but have had D 3 times ...I don\\'t think I am under medicated, I think I may just need to switch the type of Meds.\\n\\nWhat I wrote earlier is all that is on the report.\\n\\nCecum Biopsy : Chronic Active Colitis with Ulceration- No Sysplasia or malignancy identified.\\n\\nRectum Biopsy: Chrinic Proctits, moderately active\\nOK, so I\\'m confused.  You have rectal inflammation AND cecal inflammation, but not inbetween??\\n\\nWhat medication change do you think you should be on?\\n\\nq\\nHey Quincy\\n\\nSee, now we are on the same page. Yes I have colitis in the rectum and the cecal but not in between, at least that is what this GI has been telling me. I don\\'t know, I was thinking maybe 1000 MG in one shot is too much?\\n\\nI don\\'t know but I woke up with terrible cramps again and more D in the middle of the night for an hour. All I know if that I did not have \"D\" before taking Canasa and now I get bouts every 3-5 days on non stop.....and it wears the heck out of me.\\n\\nLast night I had to take 20 mg of Dicyclomine and 1 Imodium to get back to sleep so I could come to work. Now I am tired and my stomach has little pinches (small cramps I guess) periodically.\\n\\nI feel like on this med I feel great on my good days but it causes me to have more frequent bad days. I am actually really confused, and it is also a bit depressing. I have a job were I am constantly inform if people, running meetings, selling, ect....and I can\\'t really have days like this.\\nHi...well, again...I don\\'t think you\\'re on enough medication for dealing with the rectal inflammation.\\n\\nI use the enemas which are 4000mg in one shot.  You aren\\'t considering one thing...the rectum is where UC starts.  You have one form that\\'s unique in which the cecum and rectum are involved.\\n\\nYou haven\\'t yet told me how much of the lower part is involved...it should actually state that on your biopsy report.\\n\\nDid the doc do biopsies all throughout your colon?  It should also state the incriments...meaning each area should state whatever...no inflammation, etc.\\n\\nTry not to depend on the imodium..push for more meds...ask for the Rowasa retention enemas and get the inflammation dealt with.\\n\\nq\\nYes he did a Biopsy - This is the hole report: am I missing something? So you think I may want to do one in the morning and one at night?

The rectum biopsy has mild to moderate architectural distortion, mild to moderate chronic inflammation, rare Paneth cell metaplasia and patchy criptitis. There are no granulomas identified. The Findings are most suggestive of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease. Clinical enoscopic correlation is needed for accurate classification. There is no evidence of dysplasia. There are no organisms identified.\\n\\nThat is it, nothing says how much or where....Should get a new doctor? I have only seen him 4 times since November, not like he is on top of my situation\\nI\\'m puzzled that you don\\'t have other biopsies throughout your colon....I get 30 - 36 biopsies done each time.  5 or 6 in each section.\\n\\nBut, that could be at your next c-scope.\\n\\nAgain, it doesn\\'t say how much of the rectum is involved...should be in a measurement incriment.\\n\\nI think these are questions you should formulate and ask him at your next appointment.  I don\\'t think you need to change doctors at this point...but I still think you need to be on a stronger rectal med which covers more area such as the retention enema.\\n\\nq\\nThanks, I am going to see another doctor anyway because I want to walk him through everything I know and what is going on, I think a fresh set of eyes and ears would help at this point. I also seem to have an issue with the allergy shots that I just started, every time I get the I have a flare that night....I have very very bad out door allergies and I think my UC may be triggered by this also...So again all this information is something I want to run by a new doctor...\\nDefinitely make a list and push for a plan...then make another appointment in about 6 weeks to revisit.\\n\\nAre you on any antihistamines?\\n\\nWhat other supplements are you taking?\\n\\nq',\n",

Pain in my lower abdomen when I eat.  Sometimes it can be as little as a cracker, other times it's steak, potatoes, etc.  Not just mild pain, but full on doubled over, sweating, nausea, kill me now pain.  No antacid touches it.  Then we have the extremely irregular bowel issues.  Sometimes loose, sometimes not but always painful!  I've been to emerg a number of times and they send me home saying, nothing we can do.  I'm tired of all of this and a friend said it sounds like an ibd or Crohns.  Anyone have similar stuff going on or have any advice?  I'm back to my dr tomorrow to demand painkillers and pray someone has some answers.\\n\\nThank you so much.\\nIt sounds like what I experienced before being diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis this past November, but it could also be other things. The only thing you can do is wait to see your doctor, I would tell you to just watch your temp. If you start to get a temp before you see the GI of 101 or higher then go to the emergency room.\\nhi tic,\\nIm juju, i was dxd with uc last year after a colonoscopy in june.  my symptoms started with blood in the stool that got worse and the i started getting lots of moucous as well.  i think the main symptom thats common with uc is blood.  if you are getting no blood and a mix of diarrhea and constipation you could have colitis or irritable bowel syndrome but the only way of knowing for sure is a colonoscopy.  they will take biopsies to find the cause if they suspect colitis. i have a friend with ibs and it got so bad 1 time she had to miss a flight.  she said she was crawling around on the floor she felt so bad. also just a thought have you considered gall stones as the culprit.  keep at the docs, persevere with tests.\\nhi tic,\\nIm juju, i was dxd with uc last year after a colonoscopy in june.  my symptoms started with blood in the stool that got worse and the i started getting lots of moucous as well.  i think the main symptom thats common with uc is blood.  if you are getting no blood and a mix of diarrhea and constipation you could have colitis or irritable bowel syndrome but the only way of knowing for sure is a colonoscopy.  they will take biopsies to find the cause if they suspect colitis. i have a friend with ibs and it got so bad 1 time she had to miss a flight.  she said she was crawling around on the floor she felt so bad. also just a thought have you considered gall stones as the culprit.  keep at the docs, persevere with tests.\\nBlood is not always present with UC, I have never has an ounce of blood in my stool or bowl.

I went back to my family doc and they got me in to see a GI but not until July.  All of them 'surface tests' as my doc called them are normal but she said that doesn't mean I am fine, just means they are unsure of what exactly it is.

       " {'post': 'I\\'ve been dx with IBD since 2000 @ 12 yrs old. I\\'ve never had any surgeries for my IBD (which resembles Crohns more so than UC) and opt for meds only during a flare. I\\'m currently in what I believe to be a pretty severe flare waiting for my referral to a GI. My current symptoms which have me concerned is severe left sided pain that comes in waves and vomiting blood. My question is at what point should an IBD patient go to the ER? I do not believe I have an obstruction because I\\'m still having D so what can the ER really do for IBD patients? My OB (I\\'m 18 wks pregnant) gave me Bentyl and Percocet which neither are helping. Even on the percocet (an anti-diarrhial and pain medicine) I\\'m still going a LOT. I can deal with the D as I\\'ve never known anything different but the severe pain is unbearable.\\nYour pregnant and your in this bad of shape, why would you not go to the ER. What are you waiting for, you can never be too careful, and if your puking blood there may be something else wrong besides you IBD. I would GO NOW!\\nThe reason I\\'m hesitant is because I went to the doctor twice last week and both doctors didn\\'t seem concerned. (they\\'re OBs) In one of these appointments I was crying the whole time and could barely walk from the pain. That\\'s when he prescribed the Percocet and said \"yup it\\'s your bowels hurting.\" No really? The puking blood didn\\'t start until this weekend so after the appointment. Im thinking I may call nurse advice and if they tell me to go on I\\'ll have hubby take me when he gets off of work. I just don\\'t have much faith in the army hospital...\\nI would still go...\\nI called nurse advice who told me to call 911...instead opted to go to the ER when hubby got home. Because I\\'m pregnant they couldn\\'t do many tests. Did an ultrasound which showed a healthy baby, no free floating fluid, abscess or hydronephrosis of the kidney (since I also have kidney stones). I did have a UTI (always get them cuz of the stones) so they have me fluids, morphine, zofran, and rocephin. Sent me home on Prednisonolone & Cefdinr antibiotic. Suppose to follow up with my OB to speed up my GI referral. Didn\\'t really get answers but glad to be on steroids to hopefully help with this flare\\nI am happy the baby is healthy. I tell you, I don\\'t flare that bad, when I do flare I get a bit weak and have some cramps but most of the time I don\\'t get \"D\"- I give people like you a lot of credit, I don\\'t know how you can keep it together with all these symptoms....Good luck with your health and your baby!',\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi, I am really hoping there is someone on here that might be able to offer some input to what my son has been going through.\\n\\nHe is 3 years old and about two months before he turned 3 he started vomiting. At first we thought it was the flu, but then it kept happening. It would be daily then weekly, then nothing for a week or two, then again daily several times. I kept bringing it up to the pediatrician and he said it was post nasal drip and put him on nasonex. Vomiting continued and I kept bringing it up again to the dr. He then said acid reflux and put him on zantac - vomiting still persisted. Also said lactose intolerance and put him on lactose free milk.\\n\\n8 months later and he is still vomiting regularly. I changed drs 3 months ago as we were getting nowhere. That dr ordered blood tests and everything came back fine - no food allergies, liver good, no celiac disease (which I thought it was), etc. Referred him to a GI who we just saw this week after waiting 3 months to get in. My son was actually doing better and had not vomited in 3 weeks, almost cancelled the apt but decided to keep it since we had waited so long, then the vomiting started again right before the apt.\\nAlong with the vomiting he has abdominal pain, either loose stools or constipation (stools are often black). The GI had us bring in a stool sample and we are awaiting the results - said he is looking for h pylori or something else, but don't remember what the name was. If that comes back okay he is going to do an upper GI.\\nHere is where I started to think Chrohn's though- I started remembering other symptoms he has had, but I never thought to connect them. He has complained of his foot and leg hurting (bone pain?) which I thought was just growing pains, eye pain (which thought was due to his not sleeping), and mouth hurting (thought sensitive teeth due to all the vomiting-possibly cavities), cries when sitting in his carseat, complains his butt hurts a lot, and now has a rash on his butt, could these be related to maybe having Chrohn's?? I read that kids with Chrohns lose weight or are small though? Before this happened he was very small, now he looks kind of heavy for his age (but maybe he has a blockage causing the weight gain? he gained pretty fast it seems) The dr is checking for a twisted bowel if he does the upper GI, but does any of this sound like Chrohn's?\\n\\nI am just going crazy trying to figure out what is wrong with my son. Being this sick for 8 months is ridiculous and he is not the same kid he used to be. He used to love people, be outgoing, friendly, happy. He can still be that way once in awhile at home, but he will not talk to anyone he doesn't know really well, will grunt or scream when people he does not know even talk to him, won't even stand on the scale or let the drs or nurses touch him. This has been so traumatic.\\n\\nAny input or words of encouragement would be wonderful and appreciated. Thanks for reading\\nPoor little guy must be so traumatized after all this. I did Know a baby who had this going on, but it started as soon as he went on solid foods. His parents took him off all gluten and he did get better, or maybe he grew out of it. Anyway they still keep the gluten way down and he is five now and OK. I hope that this new round of tests will help him. Sera\\nI just can't wait to get some answers.He now has a rash on his feet that look like tiny bruises so I am getting worried\\nWell, his stool test came back normal so upper GI scheduled for tomorrow am\\nI am not sure about little kids with it but I feel for you, I truly do. My son was lactose intolerant and it took months to figure it out. I know you said he tested neg for celiac but have the doctors talked about maybe a gluten intolerance? I know a couple years ago I had the vomitting and other symptoms you mentioned (granted I also have Ulcerative Colitis) but it felt different than the UC flare ups so I went gluten free and it helped some. I did test positive for h.pylori but only after they did an endoscopy and took biopsies (no other tests indicated h.pylori).. I hope the doctors can figure out whats going on with your little guy\\nI feel bad for him because I know what it feels like as an adult and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.\\nThanks for the reply, his upper gi came back normal, they told me he is constipated!! (not sure how accurate since he wouldn't drink the barium, had to force it with a syringe and he hardly had any in his tummy) They put him on prilosec (but not sure why as they told me he does NOT have acid reflux) and miralax. He threw up the prilosec, it must taste really bad. The miralax gives him diarrhea so I don't give it to him every day or if I do I give him a little bit. Not sure how a kid that goes every day several times can be constipated.\\nHe has not thrown up in 3 weeks with the exception of one time, but I think that was due to the heat.\\nNot sure what i think now that he has gone that long (I am glad of course, but it wasn't like it was all in my head there had to be something wrong, right?)\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I am curious to learn early symptoms people had before diagnosed with Crohn\\'s.  I know this disease is very different for different people depending on which part of the GI system it impacts.  Did anyone have just vague symptoms of fatigue, occasional stomach pain, upset.  Occasional loose stool.  Gas. But consistently lots of fatigue and just not feeling well.\\n\\nI have a 16 year old I am concerned might have something like this as it runs in my family.  I don\\'t know if it is better to get a early diagnosis or let things run their course.  At times she is fine but has many episodes that are of concern.  I do not want to alarm her or put some worry in her head unnecessarily. So I am ambivalent about having any tests for most of the time she functions fine.  She does have occasional stomach/GI problems.  Fatigue and general not feeling well is more consistent.\\n\\nThanks for any thoughts.\\nTry starting her on an over the counter probiotic, see if she feels better after a month. Sometimes it is your digestion track, and many people react different to feeling \"off\" - If it is not constant I think your doing the right thing by not getting her worked up....\\nOK.  Thanks so much.  Both your suggestions make sense and are helpful.  We\\'ve had her on OTC probiotics when she has a \"flare up\" and they seem to help but haven\\'t maintained a preventative regiment.  I will do it!!\\nThere are yogurts that have probiotics that I take and seem to help. Other than that I\\'d just try and watch her diet, I was diagnosed when I was 17 and when I changed some of the things I ate it helped with the flares. Caffeine and raw veggies, and milk seem to be the main culprates during my flare ups. But I remember right before I was diagnosed I was really sick, and I mean really sick. My parents gave me anti-diarrhea meds but it didnt help. My stools were mostly mucos, and pink tinted. It took me a while to figure out the pink tint was from my stools and not related to my period. But things even now are always worse during or right before my period. I was tired a lot and didn\\'t want to get out of bed. I don\\'t remember much else though.  I hope she gets to feeling better.\\n[Thanks for sharing your information and helpful suggestions.  I\\'m sorry you have to go through your health problems with crohn\\'s.  My daughter has the same problems around her period. you speak of...feels worse and is so tired all the time.  I\\'m working on getting her to take probiotics and eating yogurt may be easier to get her to follow.  She doesn\\'t want to get out of bed many times.  My sister who is now 67 was diagnosed when she was 26 years old.  I have watched her go through so much with it.  Her son was diagnosed when he was in his 30\\'s about 15 years ago.  Watching what they have gone through I know it\\'s a very debilitating disease.  I know it seems like stress impacts her GI a lot.  I also wonder if just getting overly tired also makes it worse.   Take care of yourself and thanks again.\\n\\nYes getting overly tired will/can only make symptoms worse. I know this from experience. I have a 6 year old who gets up really early and sometimes I don\\'t get sleep at night because I am up visiting the restroom\\nand I know the next day is going to really hard!  Make sure the yogurt says probiotics on it, not all yogurt has it. I know activia and some dannon brands have it right on the label. My husband tried helping and got me yogurt but it didn\\'t have the probiotic in it... just look at the label (usually says it right on the front).\\nIt is possible that she has IBS and that it is draining her.  Find out what kind of stress she is under and help her find different ways to cope instead of putting it all on her stomach/colon. Also, it probably wouldn\\'t hurt to have stool samples checked for parasites.  You can get these from undercooked foods, water (Drinking it or swimming in it), and many of other thing.  This is what I would suggest.  Hopefully it is just a small case of IBS, if not just something viral that she has happened to catch.  I hope you find an answer and that she feels well soon.\\n\\nThanks so much.  Hadn\\'t considered parasites.  For now she seems to be mostly stable.  Just occasional minor symptoms.  I will be interested to see how it goes for her after school starts and she has more pressure and gets less rest.  The next trip to the doctor\\'s office I will have them do a stool check for parasites.  It\\'s interesting a read a research article about experimental treatments for Crohns for patients who don\\'t respond well to traditional treatment.  One approach was to inject the patient with pig worm larvae. Apparently the system will attack these and leave the gut alone.  One theory is that we are \"too clean\" as no 3rd world and/or underdeveloped countries have this disease. Thank you for taking the time to offer advise.',\n",

       " {'post': 'So i was dx with UP in 2006 ( mucous, bloody stool16-17 cm) , treated with Canasa, Flax, VSL, for about 8 months. Tapered to nothing, training for marathon ( 2010) , symptoms returned, but worse then ever...5-6 time/day bloody stool, diarrhea,severe pain,. just horrible. Had a sigmoidoscopy, 18 cm, proctitis, started enemas, and canasa, took about 2months, went away, tapered after about a year to nothin. Fast forward to March, ( 2012)  was probably eating a little more tabasco sauce, plus started to take ALleve again ( hadn\\'t taken them since 2006). Started constipation, then nausea, then the symptoms of UP, but never bleeding, just feeling like I had to have BM, pressure, pain with BM, started canasa, and rowasa, symptoms went away, but not completely.\\nStart training for a triathlon, and about 3 weeks ago, started pressure badly, and started seeing specks of blood again. Enema, and supps daily, symptoms aren\\'t worse, but not a lot better. One day nothing, one day pressure. Blood is once a week, and only a speck or so, but still there.\\n\\nMostly issues are rectal pressure, morning stomach pain, bloating. by the afternoon, after enema, flax, mint tea, I feel better. But after any BM, pressure hangs on for about an hour or so.\\n\\nMy colonoscopy is Wed ( endoscopy too), and I want to know what suggestions you have for my MD>\\n\\nAlso, does UP cause upper abd bloating?\\nAnd does it cause the symptoms that I have even with out the blood?\\n\\nIt\\'s not nearly as bad as 2010, but it\\'s still hanging on...would you suggest oral meds?\\nAnd finally, my GI never tells me that I need to do something, supps, enemas, etc...for the rest of my life, but I kind of think I should...? If not every day, at least weekly or something to keep the inflammation down??\\n\\nANy thoughts???\\nThe symptoms sound as though your UP flare (inflammation) is a bit lower than previously..meaning more limited  and milder at this point (because no bleeding).\\n\\nThe upper symptoms are common with limited in the rectum inflammation as well as the other obvious such as rectal discomfort.\\n\\nWhy are you using the enema during the day?  When are you using the Canasa?\\n\\nI would suggest you ask your doc for dicyclomine, it\\'s an antispasmodic that can help with some of the discomfort/spasming.\\n\\nWhat was your tapering process in the past?\\n\\nBasically, you should be on maintenance rectals after tapering to every second night, then to every third or twice a week...indefinitely .\\nIncrease the enemas at the first symptoms (which could/could probably be constipation and change of stool that reflect a slower moving colon).\\n\\nAre you taking the flax oil as your omega 3?\\n\\nI would definitely suggest a low dosage of oral 5aSA such as Asacol or even Apriso to keep everything above the rectum/sigmoid in a nice quiet state.  Plus...it\\'s believed that 5ASA is a good protector as well..helps lessen the cancer risk.\\n\\nDo you have copies of your previous biopsies?\\n\\nHope the scope goes well on Wednesday....ah, the dreaded prep.  What will you be using?\\n\\nq\\nGood Morning!\\n\\nThanks for your reply, you are very knowledgable on this subject and i\\'m so grateful that you responded.\\n\\nI\\'m using the enemas twice a day because I obvioulsy have no idea how to treat this and a medical website  said i could to twice daily enema and twiece daily canasa...? Of course tday, PREP day, is the first day that I have felt the best since starting them twice a day about a week or so ago.\\n\\nI have the prescription for the antispasmodic, but I never filled it.\\n\\n\\nMy tapering in the past has been basically every night supps, to every other, to every 3rd to weekly, ish...to nothing.\\n\\nI put 2 tsps of ground flax in oatmeal every day, have been since the first flare in 2006. I had stopped this year, because I was trying to up my protein for the triathlon training...that\\'s when things started to go badly. I was eating eggwhites with hot sauce every day, and taking Alleve for achilles tendonitis...not every day, but I know better...\\n\\nI was wondering about the upper abd symptoms...I had an upper abd ultrasound in March but it was normal, so I figured it ws from the UP, of course my GI was like \" well, it could be\"? He wasn\\'t very definitive on that, but I was pretty sure...\\n\\nI have copies of everything\\n\\n\\nI\\'m having the tests done tomorrow at noon...( moved from 7am sadly), so today im clears, at 2 it\\'s ducolax, then miralax. Then nothing...I hate the prep....\\n\\nSo i should speak to him about oral meds AND supps? His feelings are if it\\'s limited to the rectum, the supps and enemas are better absorbed?\\n\\nThanks again for responding...I\\'m pretty clueless with this and I am sure I should be seeing a different GI...\\n\\nCan you explain why it appears to be just limited to the rectum based on the symptoms? So The bleeding comes from higher?\\nIf there is no blood present, you may just have extreme IBS. That can cause all your symptoms and you could be getting it because of your change in diet or just anticipation of your events when training. I have the same issue, but I get it under extreme (I mean extreme) stress.\\n\\nI was diagnosed with sever UC and had a massive flare in November 2011, in May 2012 I had a second c-scope and they said I was perfect. Not remission, perfect! I said how? The doctors were not sure, so they gave me a blood test called Prometheus. Have you had it? If not do it.\\n\\nIt tells you if you have any form of IBD, if you don\\'t and it come back clear then it is more than likely IBS. I would then do what I did, get a life coach or someone you can really talk too.....it helps\\nI have no bleeding with most of my flares because I recognise symptoms early and treat my upping the rectals to nightly.\\n\\nRegarding the bleeding...remember that there are incriments in inflammation. Bleeding means that the tissue has already increased inlammation to the point of friability/fragility.\\n\\nMost of us with UC have IBS, and while some of your symptoms could be IBS, I would suspect it is NOT with the rectal / upper discomfort.\\n\\nI personally wouldn\\'t treat with enemas twice daily at this point.  If you have Canasa, use it during the day and the enemas at night.\\n\\nThe oral/rectal treat both ends approach is the best...the oral for coverage above to help it from spreading upward.  Yes, the rectal meds regardless how high it is because UC flares start at the rectum.\\n\\nLooking forward to hearing how your c-scope goes..sucks it\\'s late in the morning...enjoy your after-scope breakfast.\\n\\nq\\nThere is increasing evidence that food intolerances such as gluten and diary, may play a role in inflammatory bowel disease. I would suggest getting some blood work to check for celiac disease, and wheat and dairy IGG antibodies (delayed allergy testing), all blood tests. Be sure they do the IGG, not IGE, as IGE only tests for acute allergic reactions to foods such as will cause anaphyllaxis to peanuts. Gluten and dairy and many other food allergies are more slowly reactive and insidius culprits in the GI tract, which IGG measures. A functional medicine doctor will be more familiar with this approach. Food intolerance typically causes the upper abd. bloating. I agree with the previous suggestion of Asachol for prevention of these flares. If the involvement is up to 17 cm, that is clearly in the sigmoid colon as well, so not confined to rectum. This is a serious disease and should be treated seriously and aggressively enough to prevent flares like this and progression of the disease up the colon. I also wonder if the ground flaxseed could be aggravating it, as it is used for a laxative, and it\\'s coarse, hard texture could be irritating to the inflamed mucosa of bowel.\\nThanks for everyone\\'s suggestions...so the test was fine, but of course the prep...oy...just can never seem to do that without vomiting..right before the last cup of fluid...anyway, it\\'s over..\\nSo he spoke to me when I was still recovering, but from what I remember, he said, it was a smaller area, more mild instead of severe, exactly as you predicted Quincy...\\n\\nHe said to do whatever I was doing...then I told him I was doing 2 enemas and 2 suppositories for about 2 weeks...and that\\'s when I thought I heard him say we can start something like 6MP?\\nThe other thing was he found 1 ulcer in the ileum? The first time I had a colonoscopy ( not from him) they found 3 ulcers in the ilieum...and I am pretty sure they did some blood test for Chron\\'s? I\\'m almost 100% sure they did it, and it was negative. But he seemed a little concerned about that ulcer? Does anyone know why? If I had the blood test done and have had 4 colonoscopies since then and never have any biopsies said Chron\\'s, could it still be?\\n\\nAgain, I was out of it, and my husband wasn\\'t there yet. But he did say the same thing to my husband, that it was better than 2 years ago. I knew that just because this time, there really hasn\\'t been any bleeding...just very very little staining, and that\\'s only maybe once a week at the most...\\nSo I do feel better about the improvement, but I really want to make sure it doesn\\'t get as bad as 2 years ago.\\nAny suggestions? Im meeting him next week to find out biopsy results ( there were come ulcers in my stomach )\\nRight now Im using Canasa three times a day...I have my triathlon in 2 weeks, so I want tomake sure I stay controlled...then after that, I will start whatever.\\nShould I ask him about oral meds in addition to the canasa? If so what do you suggest?\\nANd what about VSL ? I can get a script for DS so my insurance will cover it? I used it in the past and liked it, but was wondering anyone\\'s thoughts?\\nThanks again for everyone\\'s thoughts and suggestions!!! this place has always been a life saver to me.\\nHi...congratulations on getting through \"most\" of the prep..good you only threw up the last bit. By then, the prior amount would have done its thing.\\n\\nYou had upper and lower scopes..wow, lots in one session, but considering you\\'re having multiple ulceration areas, best to do it.\\n\\nBasically, CD can happen anywhere in the digestive tract from mouth anus, different areas at the same time.  Considering inflammation areas are in the ileum as well..I wouldn\\'t lean toward you as a UC patient.\\n\\nI\\'m not clear on the term ulcers.  In the stomach I can understand if they\\'re isolated and inflammation areas that include ulcers.  They, however, could be caused by h. pylori...hope that it\\'s the issue...they can be treated by antibiotics.  If they\\'re not, then it\\'s possible that CD is the culprit.  Biopsies may tell the story.\\nThe term ulcers in the ileum...again, is that meaning areas of inflammation including separate ulcers?\\n\\n\\nRegarding testing for CD/UC differentiation via blood test...no such definitive actually.  The prometheus isn\\'t a guarantee.  I know of many who have had the testing...stated no, no, no for CD.  And after colon removal..some definite as yep, CD.    The only way for inflammation in the ileum with UC would be backwash, and that\\'s usually with pancolitis..you don\\'t have that from what I understand.\\n\\nWas there any inflammation in the cecum?\\n\\nwell, you were doing the right thing regarding treating quickly.  I\\'m concerned, however, that you dropped from 2 enemas and 2 supps daily to 3 supps daily.  Considering how you\\'re training and for a stressful event, I would suggest you stick with the enema at night and maybe one or two supps during the day.\\n\\nAre you not on an oral 5ASA?\\n\\nI hope the doc took lots of biopsies throughout to help determine what\\'s going on.\\n\\nRegarding the 6MP, that\\'s a personal decision whether to up to the immunosuppressant meds. The fact that you aren\\'t determined clearly of what you have, your flares aren\\'t necessarily horrific at this point and if you\\'re not on an oral 5ASA, that route isn\\'t totally exhausted.\\n\\nto be continued..\\nq',\n",

       " {'post': \"i have been having severe stomach cramps for about 9 months now that have gradually been getting worse. It got so bad a month ago that i had to ring 999 and was in hospital for 6 days. They did a CT scan and have diagnosed me with chron's disease. They said that my upper bowel and lower stomach were inflamed and when i was trying to eat it has been causing the pain. I am now 3 weeks into a polymeric diet where i aim to drink up to 7 ensure plus milkshakes a day. The pain did subside but the last week it has come back. I now get a sharp, very intense shooting pain in my stomach that only eases when my stomach makes a loud rumbling noise. I am usually healthy aged 28, male, usually weighing around 11.5 stone, but i am currently about 8.5 stone. I am not currently on any medication until i see a gastro doctor at the enf of the month, only paracetamol and codine for the pain which no longer work. Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this new pain and what i could do to treat it?\\nHey there. It sounds like you have ulcers in your stomach. I went through the same thing the first time around. I lost abunch of weight, was in constant pain, and had to drink shakes to survive. I would experience the pain and grumbling and tightness. My advice? Drink broth and gatorade instead of ensure. The shakes can be too heavy on your stomach, especially if they contain dairy. Best wishes.\",\n",

My worst prolonged flare-ups happened whenever I tried to quit smoking which ultimately led to resumption of the habit.

Thus, a horrid flare-up of colitis. Having been presribed steroid drugs, enemas, and prednisone(all to no avail) I discovered some promising medical studies on-line using nicotine patches.

       " {'post': \"Hi everyone, Im really new here, and just recently had to go to the ER due to some tummy issues.My family has a history of colon cancer, gall bladder issues, diveticuolous(sp), IBS and IBD, actually my mother had 2/3 of her colon removed due to cancerous cells. Pretty much all my life, ive had tummy issues, and just about anything can make me vomit, AND normally, I have a BM about 3 times a day with mucsos,until a 2 months ago.\\n\\nAbout 2 months ago, i started going more frequently, about 5 to 6 times a day.My stomach seems to be a bit tight and gassy. Let just ahead and 2 weeks ago, I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night, due to it waking me, and my toliet had a nice pool of blood in it. I freaked out a bit, but it didnt happen again the rest of the day. Well this past saturday, there was again another pool of blood, larger this time, and clots.Needless to say, I went to the quick care, and told the MD. He gave me some meds...BENTYL, and Sulfazine, and told me to see a GI for a c-scope, because it could be UC or crohns Disease. My appointment is Friday.Is it possible im over-reacting, and theres nothing wrong with me. O, im going on 25 in a month.\\n\\nSo Im just wondering what were you first signs or symptoms, and how do you usually feel on a daily basis.\\nThanks\\nMy first symptoms were I was very tired, had loose bowel movements several times a day to the point that they turned almost pure mucos and blood, and then it was just blood. On a daily basis I feel pretty crappy.. literally. I have 8-10 bowel movements a day, most are with little warning ahead of time. I really have to watch what I eat and how much sleep I get. If i don't get enough I am really tired and go to the restroom even more. I can't stand to have anyone or anything put even the slightest pressure on my abdomen because it is sore constantly, sometimes its more of a back ache it just depends. I was diagnosed in 1999 with Crohns, then 2 years ago they switched it to Ulcerative Colitis (not sure why). But int he beginning I just had the occasional flare ups though I did go a lot. The prep for a c-scope is worse than the actual scope part mainly because you are in the restroom for what seems like forever. It could be but I had a friend who also had similar symptoms to you and it was some sort of bug or infection in her intestine and it was resolved rather quickly. Hope all goes well but honestly the more you stress about it the worse you will make yourself feel. Try and relax, take hot/warm baths, get a massage or something to help you relax.\\n\\nThank you so much for the response. I went to the GI and based on my family history, and symptoms, he felt I need a C-scope.Its scedhuled for Aug 1, and the day before I have to do the usual preps,like taking 5 ducolax stool softners and a laxtive. Hopefully everything comes back normal.\\nhi Jessi, i'm glad you're getting a C-scope because that's the only way to find out.\\nas far as i know, symptoms greatly varies among individuals. i dont have diarrhea, mainly mucus on toilet paper, some rectal bleeding, mild abdominal cramping all the way to rectum and a little fatigue.\\nbased on your symptoms, this could be a lots of things. i hope it turns out to be nothing wrong, maybe just IBS???\\nsome tips for the colonoscopy:  make sure you drink that nasty laxative and stay home for the day. it basically makes you crap all day till you feel like your peeing through your butt lol i know the waiting game is awful. anyways good luck on your C-scope\\n\\nHi Jesssie,\\nMy 1st symptoms were blood and reared its ugly head last february. i had given up smoking and was moving house.  so stressed.  The blood was on the paper and marbeled through the stool every bm.\\nI went to the GP and the 1st thing that was done was stool sample to test for bugs and wait 4 months for a colonoscopy.  I had it in June.\\nthe prep wasnt too bad.  2 nights of dulcolax and liquid diet the day b4.\\nThe colonoscopy showed proctitis and they took several biopsies.\\nI had to wait another age for results of biopsies and it came back Ulcerative colitis.\\nGood luck in the scope.  with your family history at least you'll have alot of understanding support.\\nThank you both so much. Its nice to hear about others symptoms and their c-scope. My stomach has been okay for this past 2 weeks, unless you call occacisonal contispated.\\nWere you given the go-lightly type stuff, or an overthecounter type meds. My GI wants me to do a liquid diet the day before, along with 5 Duclax stool softners and than Mirolax....I will have a few movies and some books on hand for tuesday, since my c-scope is on Wedensday.\\n\\nNo, they sent me out 6 dulcolax and 2 sachets of citra fleet.\\nboy i wasnt well,\\ni must of went to the bog 30 times at least,\\nit was a full cleanout.  was completely wrecked and weak the day of the colonoscopy.  i had mine on monday there.  they only did the left side.  the transverse colon looked ok anyway so they didnt need to go further.\\ni watched mine with no sedation and it was obvious that my colon wasnt well.\\nhope yours goes well today.\\ntheyll be able to tell you right away what they see if you dont watch it yourself.  id recommend it.  it was a class exp.\\nlet me know how you get on.\\n\\nJu\\nThanks so much juju...so the doctors office called to let me know my co-pay and man that about knocked me out.

       " {'post': \"I know that this is an embarrasing question but i have a colonoscopy next tuesday and i am extremely nervous about it. More so about taking citrafleet. in fact the effects of the citrafleet are worrying me more than the procedure, i have heard that the more u eat leading up to the day you take it the worse the effects will be, and i have heard you are the toilet for hours, feel sick and have stomach pain. Is this true, an if so is there anything else i can take?\\n\\nNo questions are embarrassing for those of us who share this disease with you. You don't need to be too apprehensive about the prep. You're right that the prep is worse than the procedure, and I've had more than 10 of them. I haven't used citrafleet, but for my last two colonoscopies, I've used mobiprep and it's much easier than the golytely I used in the past. I would just follow the instructions from the doctor, and I wouldn't worry about eating more or less than normal. You do end up going to the bathroom quite a few times, but you're trying to clean everything out of your colon after all. I've never had to stay in the bathroom--just go when the urge strikes. I would stay home after drinking the prep. Like I said, I don't know how much you have to drink with citrafleet, but you'll be fine. You shouldn't take anything else along with the prep since the goal is to clear everything out so that the doc can get a good view. The procedure itself is easy in my experience, but I always get sedated for it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCitrafleet, although not exactly tasty is one of the better preps. I have the hardest time with the gallon go-lightly (how every you spell it). Its so yucky and just a lot of volume to drink of disgustingness. The citrafleet is best when cold and chugged and at least for me, once I get it down the worse is over. It does make you empty out (as it's indended) but not any worse than you probably already are experiencing with GI issues. You should take it once you are able to be home and have access to a restroom. Best of luck\\nthankyou for replying it has calmed me down, i think i am going to have to just chug it and see, im at home all day and off work for a day after so im hoping everything will be ok. Just hope my partner doesnt need the loo very much that day :-) thankyou again\\nHave taken my citrafleet but because my hands were shaking i spilt a bit n quite a bit still went in the cup still however ive yet to go. ive heard different people go at different times but i dnt want it to not work.\\n\\n\\nHi, Ive had two Colonoscopys and its no problem .\\nI cant remember what medication I had to take and yes you do go to the toilet a lot. After the first couple of bowel movements the rest is just like liquid.\\nI went about my normal duties and never had to bolt to the toilet, I did remain at home that day just in case.\\nThe lighter you eat before the medication the better, be sure to do exactly as you are advised with the diet.\\nOne thing I will say you feel wonderful after your(C) as you are cleaned out thoroughly.  Good Luck,  Solofelix.\\nNothings happened yet im a light eater anyway cause otherwise get intergestion etc so mayb thats why its taking a while. have to have another sachet tomorrow at 5am  but as u say im sure i will feel alit lighter after lol\",\n",

I'm surprised my wife puts up with my constant grumpiness to be honest.\\n\\nMy only concern relates to the incontinence issue, especially given my pre-existing condition. My surgeon is apparently an extremely experienced colo-rectal consultant but I find him quite gung-ho about the whole thing and he certainly hasn't offered anything to allay my concerns.

       " {'post': 'Hi there!\\n\\nI\\'m brand new here, but have read a few of your posts and I see that you suffer with this horrid autoimmune disorder as well.  I hope you can help me out..I need tons of information!\\nJust to give you some history, I was diagnosed with Crohn\\'s disease and ulcerative colitis 12 years ago.  I was adviced to have my colon removed, and to wear a colostomy bag for the rest of my life (I was 18 then, so I would have rathered died).  I begged to try ANYTHING and EVERYTHING possible to treat my illness.  So, I was on large doses of steroids, 6-MP, Interferon, Asacol, Pentasa, etc., etc...of course, not all at the same time, but we tried just about everything out there to put me into remission. The funny thing is (and this is completely off the subject..), I was actually a \"trial/study patient\" for the Asacol and the Pentasa..they were not even on the market back then.  Well, so summarize...I was blessed to go into remission two years later, and I have remained in remission for 10 years.  Now granted, I\\'ve still not been \"normal\" with my bowel habits...I fluctuate between severe constipation and/or diarrhea.  SO many people think I\\'m so odd in that I can go a week to nearly two weeks without having a bowel movement, but that is how it has always been for me.  Now on to my dilemma......I\\'ve relapsed (or, I\\'m having a \"flare\"..however you want to put it).  I had a colonscopy done two weeks ago and discovered not just a couple or even a few polyps, but literally hundreds.  Apparently, this is due to all the scar tissue, inflammation, etc. from my first bout with this disease.  My doctor was unable to get up very high, due to narrowing of my intestinal tract, and a partial obstruction.  I was scheduled to have a small bowel X-ray last week, but the prep. landed me in the ER for an entire night (after drinking just the first round of \"cleansing\" stuff, it sat in my stomach for an hour and a half before I finally began to vomit uncontrollably...nothing is going down, it\\'s all coming up....one of the reasons that I weight less than 100lbs at 5\\'5\").  Now I\\'m not real sure why I\\'m telling you all of this (haha), other than it\\'s nice to \"talk\" to someone that can relate and understand what it is I\\'m talking about.  My issues that I wanted to address and get some feedback on are the chronic pain issues I have.  First of all, I have severe inflammation of not only my intestines and colon, but my joints as well.  Some days I can\\'t even get up to walk due to the pain in my knees (and I\\'m only 31 yrs. old).  I also have chronic lower back pain, pain under my rib cage (right side), and of course..the typical, continuous pain within my abdomen.  I\\'m literally in agony. My gastroenterologist has me on lortab for the pain, but at a very minimal dosage.  He is very hesitant to raise my dosage due to the fact that opiate pain control has a tendancy to cause constipation...and he is afraid that this will just create more problems.  What he doesn\\'t understand is the extent that I suffer in severe pain each and every day.  I am a super active person..I have 5 children and I\\'m constantly on the go with them, doing things for them, etc.  I can\\'t live like this.  Would you recommend seeking the advice of a pain management doctor?  If so, does he/she have to get approval through my gastroenterologist before setting me up on a pain management schedule? If I had it my way, I wouldn\\'t take anything for pain and I would just deal with it...but if I had it my way, I wouldn\\'t suffer with this disease in the first place, and I would not have chronic pain.\\n\\nI apologize for turning this into a novel, I just got excited when I read that you might just be able to help me with the million and one questions that I have regarding pain management in Crohn\\'s/colitis patients.   I\\'m sure I will have many more questions to ask, that is..if you don\\'t mind.  I\\'m so very tired right now...but as you have probably experienced, the pain I\\'ve been in lately is keeping me up and not allowing me to get any rest.  Any input, advice, etc. would be so very appreciated!!!! I look forward to hearing from you..and getting to know you better at that!\\nlUVMY5BABES, I feel so bad somehow I missed this post and came upon it looking for a different post today.  I sure hope your still around the boards.  In regards to your question about seeing a pain management doc, yes I do recommend that.  I\\'ve found that GI docs do NOT like to put us on pain meds because of the issues with our digestive systems.  I\\'m just like you constipation wise, I also can go for up to 2 weeks with nothing happening.  As per opiates and constipation problems I found that the duragesic patch was the best option as I didn\\'t have bowel problems while on it.  I had other side effects though and the cost was too much for me so I couldn\\'t stay on it.  The prep for a colonoscopy makes me violently ill also.  Sounds like you and I definitely have a lot in common with this disease.  I did have a temporary colostomy a few years back and hated it.  I really don\\'t think I would ever want to go through that again.  Again I hope your still around and if I can answer any more questions for you feel free to ask.\\nOh golly, same w my GI told me\\nThat he don\\'t believe in pain medication so I told my primary doctor that I don\\'t like him at all because they\\'re not\\nHelping me w this constant pains so they referee me\\nTo pain management and they finally got me an\\nAppointment on the 28th, I hope they would listen\\nTo me\\nThis time.. I feel you both! I just  want my life back and I have a baby girl will be 2 years old, I need to get out\\nOf my bed to take care of\\nSomeone when no one takin care of\\nMe being miserable w Uc take over my life\\nAnd I\\'m only 24.. Anyone help me\\nOut if pain\\nManagement would\\nHelp me and listen to me? Instead of\\nIgnoring\\nMe? I\\nJust write a journal daily to\\nShow my new doctor how it effect my\\nLife so you should do that too, how\\nYour pain scale out of 10 everydays.. Hope this\\nHelp! I\\'d love to talk\\nMore and help each\\nOthers w same\\nProblems! Its really good to\\nKnow that im not alone.\\nthanks!',\n",

       " {'post': \"I am new to posting.  I replied to a couple of posts but am starting this in hopes of reaching all interested.  I was diagnosed with ulcerative proctitis that developed into uc over 20 years ago.  I never had diarea just the opposite hardly any bm's mostly blood and mucus.  During this long time I saw several gastros who put me on various protocols.  I was able to get remission with Rowasa retention enemas.  For some reason the generic of Rowasa did not work.  So I continued with this I tried cutting back to use the enema weekly because of cost but I would begin to flare again.  I knew Rowasa was an anti inflammatory so I continued to search for something to combat inflammatory.  I tried several probiotics and I did feel better but never really improved my symptoms.  I learned about mutaflor (ecoli nissle) and tried that.  It didn't work for me.  I then read about VSL #3.  With the research out there on it I decided to give it a try.  I began with 2 packets per day and added 2 T of metagenics glutagenics per day as well.  This did not bring remission.  I read more about VSL and decided to give their suggested dosage for active UC a one month try.  It is expensive about $500.00 for the one month.  But Rowasa is very expensive as well so I decided to give it a try.  I took 8 packets/8T glutagenics per day spaced out in doses of 2 packets/2T glutagenics.  I went from very active bm's of mostly blood and mucus to formed regular bm's in about 2 weeks.  I continued the dose for one month then went to 4 packets 4T glutagenics per day for the next month.  I now take 2 packets/2T glutagenics per day and continue to be in remission.  This remission feels different than that with Rowasa.  With Rowasa there was always a internal low backside pain on the left.  This feels totally normal...regular daily bm's and I feel great.  I hope this helps anyone because I really wished I had tried this sooner.\\nI am glad to see a thread on this Board where VLS3 has helped someone with UC.\\n\\nI understand that it is prescribed in some areas of the country by Doctors and issurance will pay some copayment so that it's not that expensiveto the user.\\n\\nGod Bless---Harry\\nCurious.  My 8 yr old daughter has UC.  Bloody stools. We tried just about everything it seems, only thing that calms it down is high dose of steroid.  We just started VLS#3.  She does not like the taste and is difficult to get her to take it so far.  Our insurance doesn't cover the 450billion packet but does cover the 900billion packet.  Not sure why, but thought I'd share that.  I'm wondering with active UC for a 50lb kid, how many packets should she take.  I hope this works, don't want to remove her colon as doc is starting to suggest.  I know doc said 1 (high dose) packet a day.  But saw the studies for people taking the 8 packets (low dose) a day and was wondering if that should be dependent on weight.  Any thoughts?  Oh, and it is nice to read posts of some people having success with anything.  Congrats.\\njden,\\n\\nI suggest that you be conservative and start off with 1 packet daily and see the reaction. Stay on it for several days then increase it a packet at a time until you get positive results--- when the desired results are reached --- healing then stop.\\n\\nAlso, an extremely good homeopathic remedy to use is Calendula tablets 6X potency taken 4 times daily. You will have to buy it from a Homeopathic pharmacy online or by phone 3 tablets that dissolove under the tongue will be OK.\\n\\nI wish your daughter well---Harry\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I was diagnosed with IBD unspecific when I was 12 years old....after having symptoms for as long as I could remember. I am now 23 (female). I\\'ve had countless colonoscopies. Well my most recent experience was after going through what I thought was a flare and being prescribed prednisone. I went to a new gi dr and was told there was now a blood test which would show if I would have Crohn\\'s or Ulcerative Colitis since I was never told which one it was. (At the time I was told it showed symptoms of both? I had inflammation throughout my entire system from esophagus, stomach, and colon. I was seen at a Children\\'s Hospital.)\\n\\nLong story short...the test came back negative for Crohns or UC. At this point I\\'m just confused and wondering what that test was and if anyone has experienced a similar experience? My symptoms never completely go away but I\\'ve learned to live with them as I don\\'t really know any thing differently. Whatever this test was has anyone had it come back negative but in fact they have Crohns or UC? I am just wondering what I\\'ve been dealing with my whole life.\\nWas the test Prometheus?  I don\\'t believe it\\'s accurate from what I read...it can lead but not confirm.\\n\\nSo, when was your last colonoscopy?\\nDid you have an upper scope done as well?\\n\\nAre you on any medications?\\nq\\nHi hun,\\n\\nThere is a test that can be performed that will show if you are in an active flare-up of either UC or CD done using a stool sample. It is called \"Faecal Calprotectin\".\\n\\nI am in a similar situation as you. All blood tests were normal but this showed massive inflammation.\\n\\nHave a look on **** for more information. It may be worth requesting.\\n\\nTake care\\n\\nPixie xxxx\\nMy last colonoscopy was done in 2008 after I began throwing up blood at work. (I conviently worked in surgery at a small hospital) So the general surgeon admitted me to the hospital and we did a Endo and colonoscopy. Which showed inflammation in the colon, a tear in the stomach, etc. I am not currently on any meds for IBD...Ive been focusing on my kidney stone issues. After doing research I\\'ve been told stones are common in IBD sufferers. I had an appendectomy at 11 which the pathology report suggested Crohns? my current symptoms are severe right flank pain, fever, vomiting, diarrhea (when dont I have it?), severe pain when taking a bm or following any activity (can\\'t stand up straight the pain is a pinching stabbing pain) & occasional blood in diarrhea. My Urologist seemed to think the pain Im having in my flank isnt from my stones so the only other thing I could think of was IBD. (But he also missed the kidney infection I have so Im getting a second opinion) I just wonder if I should go back to a GI. This may seem silly but I really dont want another scope and I know that is what they will want to do. Thoughts?\\nI wish I could remember exactly what my GI doc said about the blood test.  It basically boiled down to that if it was positive it would just be a confirmation of what the biopsy of the colon lining showed, and if it was negative, it didn\\'t mean I didn\\'t have it.  It was something about specific vs something else - sorry - it was kind of \"science talk\"-ish and I didn\\'t retain it.  Mine came back negative, but my GI says I definitely have UC based on the biopsy results and treats me for it - and it definitely works.\\nThanks for your help. It was a blood test that he took and sent off to a lab in California. My last endo/colonoscopy were in 2008 after I began throwing up blood at work. (I happened to work in surgery at a small hospital) So the general surgeon admitted me to the hospital and I had the scopes the next day which showed lots of inflammation in the colon, a tear in the stomach and what the surgeon referred to as \"orange peel\" spots in the stomach and colon. (Basically rough patches?) I\\'m not currently on any medications for IBD...I\\'m instead battling kidney stone issues. (Which through research I have found are common in IBD sufferers) My only real link to either UC or Crohns was when I was 11 and had an appendectemy...the pathology report showed signs of Crohns in the appendix?\\n\\nMy current symptoms are fever, nausea, horrible right flank pain, diarrhea (never known anything different), occasional blood in diarrhea, and occasional intense pain on left side while having bm or followed by lots of activity (a sharp/pinching pain where I cannot stand up straight). My Urologist is not convinced my right flank pain is from my kidney stones as they are still in my kidney and \"shouldn\\'t be causing me pain\". But he also missed the kidney infection I currently have...so I\\'m getting a second opinion. I\\'m just wondering if perhaps I should go to a GI as well. But really don\\'t want to have another scope done and I know that is what s/he will want to do since it\\'s been a few years. Thoughts?\\nIf it were me, I\\'d find a good GI doc (preferrably one with experience treating IBD patients) and have the scopes.  Did anyone ever do biopsies of your intestinal or colon lining? You are obviously in a lot of distress and if having some more testing, including scopes, will help you get the treatment you need to get your quality of life back, then do it!  Good luck to you!\\n\\nTo answer your question, Ive had a biopsy during every scope. And was only ever told they showed inflammation rather than a definitive uc or crohns diagnosis. When I was younger my flares were much worse than now. Ive had tons of GI Series, follow troughs etc...which showed my intestines were so inflammed the food was backing up in my stomach which was causing me to throw up so much. I was hospitalized numerous times with a Ng tube because I was unable to keep anything down. I hated to eat which then lead me to develope anorexia as a child...and then grew into full blown anorexia nervosa as a teen due to such a restrictive ibd diet, losing weight and then liking the weight loss. I think my hesitation on going back to a GI dr is the possibility of 1) scopes (I vomit the laxative they make you drink the night before) & 2) I dnt want to be put on a restrictive diet again and ever have to face anorexia. I have lost weight recently (without trying) so that does concern me. My pain medicine and antibiotics I am currently on for my kidney issues obviously help my digestive upsets. Pain meds are anti-diarrhea agents after all...but I know this is a temporary fix for me. I also start a very competitive internship this fall along with a full load of classes, a 2 yr old, and a husband who is deployed\\nSo I want to be healthy for Fall Semester and my husbands R&R. I guess Im just thinking outloud now huh? I just dont want to have a scope if nothing is wrong.\\nI totally understand where you are coming from.\\n\\nThe faecal calprotectin test is currently being used to differentiate between IBS and IBD thus reducing the need for unnecessary colonoscopies.\\n\\nI am yet to be diagnosed with the type of IBD I have. As you can see from my profile, I am from the UK and we have to wait for appointments ( I have also raised a complaint against the consultant I was seeing...... long story)\\n\\nI have also lost a huge amount of weight due to this. When eating causes you that much pain and discomfort, you get to the point where you think \"why bother\". There is a Doc on the internet who has linked bowel/biliary disease to eating disorders. I can\\'t remember his name but I will have a look for you. His site is really interesting.\\n\\nIn the mean time I eat what I want. If I get pain ( and I always do regardless of what it is I am eating) I would rather eat what I enjoy than restrict myself.\\n\\nAnother suggestion I have is Stout. I have major constipation due to codine based meds plus everything else. I have a pint of guinness every day and it is the only thing that \"moves the mail\" lol!\\n\\nAnyway, good luck in what you decide to do.\\n\\n\\nAll the best   Pixie xxxx\\n\\n\\nEDIT P.S Google Dr W P Smedley.\\n\\n\\nxxxx\\nYou certainly have a lot on your plate and sounds like you\\'ve been through the wringer with all the testing!  I don\\'t have any answers, but maybe a doc would let you try something like Asacol to see if it helps?  It seems pretty obvious that something is going on causing you to have these problems.  I\\'m no doctor, but if they can\\'t specifically diagnose one way or another, then it seems to me why not try a treatment and see if it works?\\n\\nBest of luck to you - hope you feel better soon!\\nThank you both for your help. I\\'m having a urteroscopy on Monday so once I am recovered from that I think I will go ahead and get in to see a GI specialist. I talked with my Urologist about it today and he thinks it is a good idea to see one again. I appreciate the kind words and once I do get in to see a GI I think I will take your advice and see if a scope is absolutely necessary. If so, I will have to suck it up and have one I guess but it won\\'t hurt to ask if we could try treatment based on my previous medical records and current symptoms, without the aid of a scope. I just really dislike them! Not so much the scope part but the prep before.\\n\\nWell I officially have an apt for my tummy issues\\nLast week after my Ureteroscopy, being hospitalized for three days and then undergoing a second Urteroscopy for my kidney stones and ureter obstructions...I think my kidney issues are finally resolved. I then began having sever stomach pains which were so intense I called my doctor to get in for a refferral for a GI. At this point my original hesitation on having another colonoscopy has deminished, as the pain is intolerable. So I go in tomorrow and hopefully start the process of finding a GI doctor and getting on maintence drugs. I just do not want to get on Predinsone. I hate all the side effects, like weight gain and acne. But I plan to discuss this with the doctor. I\\'m kinda nervous but ready to get this taken care of so I\\'ll be feeling well for school.\\nYou\\'re more than welcome.\\n\\nI really hope your appt goes well. I know how stressful it is to be in so much pain yet have no answers.\\n\\nIt may be an idea to write down all of your symptoms and questions before you go to see the GI doc. That way you won\\'t leave thinking \\'damn, I should\\'ve mentioned....\\' ( Which is what I usually do\\nlol)\\n\\nFYI ( or perhaps TMI) I feel your pain about the colonoscopy. I have always said it\\'s an \\'out-ie\\' not an \\'in-ie\\'\\n\\nI really hope your feeling better soon. Let me know how it goes.\\n\\nTake care Pixie xxx\\ni had a blood test for uc..came back negative...i then had colonoscopy and had biopsies taken that confirmed mild chronic colitis had been present.

       " {'post': 'Hi everyone. I just decided to share my story with you, hoping to show some people you are not alone. I know I felt embaressed and alone when I was going through some bad flare ups, but I know now that was never the case.\\n\\nMy story begins when I was 6 years old, in the middle of the school year I came down with pnuemonia. I have asthma, so I was prone to it. I was put on an antibiotic (i wish i remembered the name) and soon after I recovered from the pnuemonia I came down with horrible diarrhea. My mother was alarmed and took me to the doctors, who said it was from the antibiotics and the diarrhea would pass. It didnt. My mom brought me to the doctors multiple times, and got the same answer of \"the antibiotics caused it\" even months after I was off the antibiotics.\\n\\nThe summer came, and my family took many vacations. I could not do anything with them. I was terrified of being away from a bathroom for more that a few minutes at a time. The next year and a half of my life mainly consisted of accidents, being absent from school, and severe malnourishment. I didnt want to eat anymore because it would always make me have to use the bathroom nearly instantaneously.\\n\\nFinally I started having blood in my stool. I never told my mom, but through a long story which I will not get into she found out. After that, my mom took me to the doctors, and today we saw a different doctor than usual. He could see there was something wrong. He promptly sent me into the hospital for a colonoscopy. I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis and put on steriods on and off for the next six months.\\n\\nI was placed into the care of a gastro-intestinal specialist. She wanted me to get my colon removed, but my parents refused to jump to that conclusion. It was only a last resort to them, and there were too many things to try before making that drastic decision. (BLESS YOU MOM AND DAD!)\\n\\nI was put onto some medication (i wished remembered the name, again.) At this point I am about 8 I think. I was now seeing a GI specialist and a shrink (I have anxiety related to having accidents in public) and I am on medication. My parents also put me on an unbelievable strict diet. But it helped alot.\\n\\nThrough a long story, I came off the medicine and diet. Today I am actually almost symptom free! Some foods irritate me more than other kids, but I have learned to stay away from them. Now I am healthy and strong, and growing fine. I\\'m 15 now. I know a girl today who had her colon removed. She cannot put on any wieght, and cannot even get through a day of school without feeling exhausted and nearly fainting.\\n\\nA NOTICE TO ALL!\\nIf you have kids with ulcerative colitis, or if even you have it, I beg you not to jump to removing your or your childs colon! It may seem like a fix, but there are other more healthy ways to try before you do this.\\n\\nThank you for listening!\\n\\nYour story is interesting and uplifting, Marie.  It\\'s wonderful to hear that someone has achieved a positive result by herself and is feeling so good.\\nI\\'ve had UC for 24 years now and no medication has worked; I\\'ve thought seriously about having a colectomy and ileostomy, but your comments have really encouraged me to seek some other treatment.  What foods have to found that help you and what foods cause the problem?  I hope you have a moment to respond to me as my life is barely worth living.\\n\\nNancy\\nHi Nancy,\\n\\nThis is my very first entry but felt I could relate to your feeling!  I had severe UC and no medication would help and I continued to set sicker until I could no longer keep any food down at all and started loosing my hair as well as my mind many days!  I had my colon removed two years ago now and while I am sooo much better, I still continue to struggle with what to eat.  I can leave the house now for hours at a time and have returned to work.  I no longer worry about accidents but have many nights of severe pain in my stomach area from gas build-up I think?!  I am hoping to get support in the diet area.  It is so hard when you don\\'t have anyone to talk to to know if your symtoms are normal or if you are crazy.  I think I am on the road to recovery, just didn\\'t realize the road would be so long\\n\\nHi there,\\n\\nThanks for sharing.\\n\\nWhat are you on these days?\\n\\nGucci\\n',\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi. My name is Amanda and I have a 6 year old daughter who was just diagnosed with Crohn's Disease this week. She's had stomach cramping and loose bowels for the past 5 months (it started with a week+ of diarrhea in June) and also swollen lymph nodes in her intestines. Since her dad has a severe case of Crohn's, her pediatrician was very quick to refer her to a GI and after a colonoscopy and endoscopy on Wednesday, here we are.\\n\\nHer father and I are no longer together so I haven't had to deal with Crohn's in awhile. We knew it would be a possibility that she'd get it, prayed she wouldn't, and really thought we wouldn't have to deal with this until she was in her late teens at least. 6 is way too young to be having to deal with this!!!\\n\\nThe GI doctor says it affects the end portion of her small intestine and her entire colon (according to the granulomas seen in the biopsies). She wants her to get her first dose of Remicade next week\\n. Her dad responded well to it but needed it every 8 weeks to keep his under control. Unfortunately he's pretty bad at keeping up with his health so he's not a good role model for handling Crohn's.\\n\\nMy mind has been spinning with all of this information. I failed to ask why she wanted to start her with Remicade so early. Is it because of her dad's severe case? Is it because it's affecting her entire colon? She has stomach pains daily but there's no blood in her stools and she's not anemic but is low on the protein stuff (can't remember the word) according to her bloodwork.\\n\\nI'm not completely clueless when it comes to the world of Crohn's but it's an entirely different ballgame when it comes to your little angel having it. Any advice you can pass along would be greatly appreciated (diet suggestions, medication suggestions, general experiences and advice).\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi people, I\\'m 29 and two weeks ago had a colonoscopy where biopsies were taken with cold forceps, anyway I have been diagnosed with moderate UC and a week ago I started 500mg of salofalk each morning. I noticed a difference over the week and started to have more regular bowel movements, no blood for a few days and the mucous vanished. 3 days ago I felt my glands becoming sore, my joints becoming painful and flemming up - DAMN -my UC has come back quite bad, it\\'s like i\\'m urinating blood from my bottom, awful cramps and diorreah quite a few times over the past few days always not feeling like i\\'m finished emptying my bowels and worried to let go of gas because it may be blood. Obviously I have come down with the flu so my question is; \"Is this a flare up because of the flu? Will I be getting back on track after the flu subsides?\" Maybe I have a tummy bug also? Can anyone PLEASE give me their thoughts or relate to what I am going through? Also my ferritin is very low, anyone know how to make it higher? I\\'m not absorbing iron properly as most know with UC the bowel doesn\\'t absorb nutrients too well.\\nI have started taking vitamin B,C & D, a probiotic, iron, flaxseed oil, fish oil, psyllium husk - 1t/s each morning and glucossamine.\\nAny thoughts on red wine? I have two glasses per night.\\n\\nGucci\\nHi gucci i seen an artical some where that said that sulphites irritate the bowel during a flare.  Red wine is full of them and so are processed foods so you might want to give it a miss while you\\'re unwell or find another drink.  I tried beer on friday night and boy did i pay for it yesterday!!!! So thats out for me. Also during a flare you lymph nodes do enlarge because your body is trying to fight itself thinking whats going on down there is an infection.  Im new to this too so researching it to your blue in the face is the way to get clued up with whats happening to your body.  In my opinion when your symptoms change suddenely like that its time to revisit your gi.  Lots of people on here had to try various drugs and combinations b4 they got it under control.  About the iron, have you tried the injections?\\nHi..you need to get on more medications right away.  I would suggest you start on at least 2000 mg daily the Salofalk and request  mesalamine rectal retention enemas (Salofalk is what I use).\\n\\nI personally don\\'t believe food causes flares but it can exacerbate some symptoms...even those without UC.\\n\\nRegarding wine...it\\'s a stimulant, and can exacerbate some of the symptoms you already have.  As well, metabolising wine is hard on the liver, which can be an issue for some of us on meds.\\n\\nYou\\'re taking high omegas...take either the flax or fish oil, but not both.  Maybe nix them for a while to see if it improves some of the diarrhea.\\n\\nI would assume the c-scope biopsies would be able to tell if you have any invaders.\\n\\nIf your iron is low, make sure you\\'re taking supplements that have iron in them as well as multi B which includes B12.  Eating meats and well balanced meals will help.\\n\\nPsyllium will help bulk the stool and probiotics will help keep the flora of your colon in balance.\\n\\nq\\nHi there - thanks for your reply. It has only been two weeks since my colonoscopy so I guess it\\'s trial and error and hopefully over time i can have it under control.\\nNo, I have not tried injections, I have an appointment with my GP at the end of the month so I am just monitoring foods and BM til then. My iron is fine, it is just my ferritin levels that seem to vary a lot. I think I get light headed because of this.\\nGucci\\n\\nFirstly, thanks for your reply. My GI is away at the moment but I will be seeing him when he returns in a month. What are these enemas you speak of? Is it to wash out the blood? I seem to lose quite a bit of blood which concerns me although I only had the colonoscopy 2 weeks ago so it\\'s early days. What do you mean by invaders? Are the cramps normal? I sure hope to get this under control, cheers\\n\\nHi..the enemas are retained medication into the rectum.  Look up 5ASA mesalamine enemas.\\n\\nUC starts at the rectum, so it\\'s a medicaiton that should be used in my opinion.\\n\\nYOu\\'re only on one 500mg Salofalk tablet a day?  Are you sure that\\'s what the prescription says?...I\\'ve never heard of an oral 5ASa medication that low.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the dosage of flax and fish oil you\\'re taking?  I think you should lower it since it can cause \"slippery butt\"...with an inflamed butt it\\'s difficult to hold bms...the oil will just make it sometimes worse.\\n\\nYou can add a fibre supplement to bulk the stool a bit and maybe help the bms to lessen.\\n\\nThe bleeding is part of having fragile tissue in the rectum and colon...medication will help that...but you\\'re not on enough of it at this point.  Can you maybe ask another doctor to prescribe you some enemas until your doc gets back from holidays.\\n\\nOh, and if that other doctor wants to put you on oral prednisone...please consider to NOT take it...truly.\\n\\nquincy\\nHi...I have never posted before but feel compelled to tell my experience with UC.  I was diagnosed over 20 years ago with ulcerative proctitis which progressed to ulcerative colitis.  I tried systemic protocol with no success.  I experienced total relief by using Rowasa retention enemas.  The generic of Rowasa did not work for me.  I continued to search for something alternatives.  I tried Mutaflor (ecoli nissle) and this did not give me relief.  I was in the middle of a substantial flare.  Mostly few if any formed BM\\'s with mostly bleeding and mucus.  I then tried VSL#3 probiotic.  I began with a dose of 2 packets per day and didn\\'t get much benefit.  After researching VSL further I decided to give it one month of an increased dosage.  I increased to 8 packets per day for a month.  I also added 1 heaping Tablespoon of Metagenics glutagenics for intestinal health...so I spaced out 2 packets and 1T glutagenics out 4 times a day.  I experienced total remission within 2 weeks.  I continued for the month then cut back to 4 packets with 1T glutagenics for another month.  I now take 2 packets per day with 1T glutagenics and have been in total remission for 6 months now.  I have regular daily formed BM\\'s and feel great.  I am so disappointed that my gastro didn\\'t give this to me as an option.  I was concerned about the cost of VSL but took the chance for one month and it was worth it!  I hope this helps someone else because I now feel I have found what works for me!\\nHi hammer 403, I will be researching VSL#3 and metagenics glutagenics, as a matter of fact I have been given a bottle of \"Gut repair\" and the ingredient is \"glutamine\" - So thank you so much for reminding me as I had put it in the back of my pantry and forgot about it with all the worry! As for the probiotics, I take one from the chemist but will need to up my dose I think. Were you put on \"Salofalk\" by your Gastro? Cheers for the post\\n\\nHi Gucci,\\n\\nNot ever put on Salofalk.  I have continued to be in remission by using VSL#3 and Metagenics glutagenics.  I now take one dose of two packets and a heaping tablespoon of glutagenics one time per day.   As for the dosage...at least for me...I did not get any response until I upped the dose to the 8 packets per day.  The VSL#3 is very potent.  If you do some looking on the internet there is a lot of research out there on it.  I was just so disappointed that my gastro never even considered a probiotic.   I had been taking BioKult and also Klaire Labs Vital 10 but these never came close to putting me into remission.  As far as I feel now...I feel no bloating from the dosage or any other potential problems.  Even when I was in remission with Rowasa I always felt a soreness/aching but I feel absolutely none of that now!  I continue to try to get some clues about how this could have happened to me.  I pay close attention to eating right and exercise.  I sometimes wonder if having been on birth control may have played a role in putting my system out of balance.  It\\'s funny but I was diagnosed shortly after stopping birth control pills.\\nAs far as iron and getting your ferritin levels up, I have found the carbonyl form of iron to work the best.  In addition to having UC I\\'ve had a gastric bypass, so my iron levels are a constant challenge for me.  Also, carbonyl is very well tolerated - doesn\\'t upset the stomach and doesn\\'t cause constipation (not that that has ever been an issue!).  Depending on what my ferritin is doing, I will take as much as 150 mg/day (I know - docs raise their eyebrows at that all the time).  But I also have bloodwork frequently to keep tabs as it can go up and down quite a bit, and that way I know I\\'m not overdoing it.\\nQuincy,\\nI was wondering why you said don\\'t take the oral Prednisone?\\n\\n\\nAs for Gucci- sorry you\\'re having a difficult time. What the others are saying is helpful. You should be on a mesalmine drug. I\\'m on Dipentum because I can\\'t tolerate any of the enemas and most mesalmine drugs. Dipentum works great. Good luck to you.\\nHi Lindy,\\nthanks for your reply. I have left a msg to talk with my GI, as well as the salafolk are you saying i need something like dipentum? I researched it and it sounds like it does not have many known side effects. I don\\'t seem to be able to get rid of all of the blood, everytime I go to the toilet I bleed, not as much as I use to but can you ever stop it completely when you have UC?\\nThanks\\nYes, the blood can be completely stopped, that\\'s when you go into a remission. And usually prednisone or IV steroids are used to induce remissions. As I\\'m finding out, sometimes even during remission periods you can still have some blood in your stool sporadically. Maybe it\\'s just me, but others on here feel free to chime in.\\nGucci...your first post was in June, have you not seen or contacted your GI since then?\\n\\nAre you still on 500 mg salofalk ... only one? daily?\\n\\nYou need to also get on the rectal retention enema as I suggested...so that both ends of your UC are being treated, as well...you need to be on a higher dosage of Salofalk oral.\\n\\nDipentum is another 5ASA oral med, if you have NO success with upping the Salofalk oral in conjunction with the rectal (I sure hope you request this suggestion), then consider to change to another 5ASA.\\n\\nPlease, please....do not choose prednisone or steroid as your choice of treatment if you\\'re able.  But, if you continue to wait and get to the point of not utilising the 5ASA meds as to how they can work for you..it might be something that you will have to have.\\n\\nRegarding using natural treatments to deal with your UC...they should be in conjunction with, not in replacement of.\\n\\nProbiotics are great.  I don\\'t use VSL#3, but many have success with it.\\n\\nYour bleeding will stop if you\\'ve treated to heal the lining to the point where it\\'s not friable (easily bleeds).  That doesn\\'t mean you still don\\'t have inflammation, remember that the colon with UC heals in stages and pretty much a pattern.  If you\\'re interested, I can explain that aspect to you.\\n\\nquincy\\n\\n\\nHi there,\\n\\nI am now on 3000mg, 6 per day as I saw him and it was my mistake in the state I was where I didn\\'t listen to the tablets I was to take. Anyhow, I seem to be more regular and not so much blood. When I get ill, I bleed more, such as the flu.\\nI will be speaking to my GI on Monday re rectal retention enemas as I agree treating both ends to make a difference.\\nWhen you flare does the UC bleed more? I seem to have stages of diareah when I\\'ve had the flu too.\\nI am interested in hearing you explain the aspect, thankyou kindly\\n',\n",

BAH!!  I have had several severe flares but none that have required surgery.  I have taken just about every type of medication for crohns and nothing seems to work.  I have had some slight results with prednisone and 6-mp.  Neither of which I am a fan of taking.  I am a single mother of a four year old boy who has so much energy he can make me dizzy on certain days.\\nI have been having a flare again for the past three weeks now and have dropped 23 pounds.  I haven't been able to keep much in when I do find an appetite to eat so in turn I am very tired.  It seems on certain days so much easier not to eat because then I don't have to deal with racing to the bathroom and being so exhausted when I come out.  It is very hard on my son to know that I don't have much energy to play with him like he would like.  I can usually catch a flare before it gets to be real bad.  This time around however it seems unavoidable.  I am not taking any medication right now as I am trying to avoid it and find something else that will work.   I have read that different spices can help ease the stomach pains.  Does anyone have any suggestions on what spices may help?  I have also read that medical marijuana has helped for some people.  Does anyone know how true that is?   I have also been experiencing extreme amounts of nausea everyday, evening waking me up in the early morning hours.  I have not been vomiting just severe nausea.  Has anyone experienced this?  And what would be suggestions for calming this?   I am looking for any suggestions right now that avoids any type of medications if possible.    It also makes it hard when my boyfriend just doesn't understand why I am tired and why I can't just eat something and feel better. He gets mad when I don't want to go out to eat or go to peoples houses for meals but I don't feel 'safe', so to speak, when I eat out.  He thinks that I am just dragging out my symptoms and being lazy, when it reality I have no energy somedays but to get the bathroom.  How to get some one to realize that this is a serious disease not something I just made up.  Someone please give me some suggestions or options.  Thank you.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'My GF is suffering from this and it\\'s so bad she can barely take the subway to my house any more.  She is seriously ready to take control of it and I am going tomorrow to get her some Probiontics I heard were very useful in managing it.\\n\\nAlso she is going to stay away from dairy and refined sugar, but I was hoping anyone that has it on this board can give us some tips or suggestions as to what they do?\\nI don\\'t have Crohn\\'s, but I do (more like did) have IBS. I saw a naturapathic doctor and it is gone now in part from removal of all dairy, gluten, sugar, corn, soy and much more so I know how hard it can be at times. Just about everything that isn\\'t chicken, fish, turkey, or a vegetable or berry. Careful with starchy veggies though. Potatoes and carrots fit into this catagory. Potatoes should never be eaten because they raise blood sugar levels very high very fast. Carrots should be used only sparingly. Breads raise blood sugar levels very fast too. The only kinds of grains I ever have now are brown rice and quinoa.\\n\\nBasically out of necessity now I make all of my food myself. That way I know exactly what goes into them. Lots of restaurants use the wrong kinds of oils like corn oil. The only two I ever use now are olive oil and coconut oil. Coconut oil is best to cook with because no trans fat can be made from heating it. Make sure she gets as much organic food as possible! That is very important. Probiotics should be helpful too and I am glad she is going on them. I use them everyday. Also helpful are plant-based enzymes because they make digestion much easier.\\n\\nI really recommend that you read \"Patient, Heal Thyself\" by Jordan Rubin. The diet I follow is extremely similiar to the one listed in that book. The author himself was dying of terminal Crohn\\'s disease and now is cured by following this diet. Another great book is \"Dr. Mercola\\'s Total Health Program\".\\n\\nSeeing a good naturapathic doctor couldn\\'t hurt either. They may have really good ideas for what else can help. The one I see does saliva testing for hormonal imbalances and sure enough with the stress and anxiety I had, I definately needed supplements. I cannot tell you how much better it has made me feel! I take supplements for my thyroid and adrenals and use a progesterone cream. Very amazing stuff and I no longer have anxiety. Hormones are really important for overall health! Anyways, if you have any other questions, I\\'d be happy to answer! Good luck to the both of you and I hope she gets over this terrible disease!\\nHi Michael\\n\\nI have crohn\\'s disease and no diet helped me, not even being nil by mouth, probiotics made me worse as it increased the distention in my abdomen. I tried endless medication. In the end i had surgery.\\n\\nDiet will not help her if she has severe narrowing of the intestines.\\n\\nI would recommend that she goes to see a gastroenterologist who can then tell her how severe her crohn\\'s is at the moment. If it is left out of control it can cause life threatening problems, which it did with me.\\nSome people swear by the recommendations in Elaine Gottschall\\'s Breaking the Vicious Cycle.  The eating regime recommended is quite strict, but the claim is that after possibly a couple of years that one can reintroduce just about all foods.\\nI also have Crohns. Its nothing to play around with. Its a very serious disease. No alternative meds will help. She needs to be under the care of a good gastrologist. I have had 3 rescetions so far. diet doesn\\'t much matter.\\n\\nShe sees one and they have done tests and all they said it\\'s not serious enough to warrant surgery.  But for the record, have the operations helped you at all?\\nI also have Crohns.  I was diagnosed at 28 and I am now 40.\\n\\nI have never had the surgery, as I\\'ve never been convinced that the problems and complications most people have after surgery are better than just dealing with the Crohns.  I have been seriously hospitalized twice with this disease.  The first time they wanted to cut, and I said NO.  The doctor said we could wait a few days to see if the meds would help, but after that I may have no choice.  Luckily, the meds did work.  I also had to have an abscess removed once from MY *** once, and I can tell you now that is NO FUN.\\n\\nDealing with Crohn\\'s is very difficult, but after 10 years with the disease, you kind of get used to it.  After a while, a certain level of pain and discomfort becomes \"normal\".  If you decide against the surgery, like I have, you just kind of accept that this is life and you work it in to your life as much as you can.  As a lawyer, I left my firm and started a solo practice.  I did this so I could manage my own schedule without feeling guilty for taking a few sick days here and there.  I know where all the bathrooms are in the local stores, and I know where all the rest stops are on I-94.  I\\'ve learned to cope.  But it often means making major changes in your life.\\n\\nAs far as meds, I\\'ve tried them all, and I mean all.  I\\'m sorry to say that for me, prednisone is the only drug that provides any relief to the Crohns, although in larger doses it presents LOTS of its own problems.  After years of taking all sort of drugs w/o relief, I\\'ve now limited my daily drug intake to 5 mg of prednisone, 1 trazadone (sleeping is a ***** with Crohns), 1 amitriptyline, 1 calcium pill (prednisone prevents calcium absorbtion), and 1 folic acid.  I\\'ve been on these dosages for the last two years, and find it just as effective as all the other crap I\\'ve been on.  No amount of prednisone is \"safe\" over a long period of time, but 5 mg isn\\'t much more than your body makes naturally anyway, so I consider it an acceptable risk.\\n\\nAs far as food is concerned, I\\'ve just about given up trying to find out what causes problems and what doesn\\'t.  I suggest you DON\\'T read the books about it.  I\\'ve read books all contradicting what the other says is acceptable.\\nIn the end, all I\\'ve learned is that eating large amounts of food at one time is far more uncomfortable than eating a little bit of the \"wrong\" thing.  Frankly, I don\\'t think any food makes the disease worse, it just may exacerbate the diarrea during a flare.  Nevertheless, I have found that extremely fatty foods are always problematic, as can be caffiene.  Regrettably, beer IS a very bad food for me.  Anything that causes gas can make a Crohns gut hurt all the more.\\n\\nAlso, do not confuse Crohns with IBD.  People that have IBD may have it for any number of reasons, including poor mental health.  I can\\'t tell you how frustrating it was when I was first diagnosed to always have people telling me I need to relax, try meditation, get a less stressful job. BAH!  Crohn\\'s does not work that way.  I could be on a tropical island with 10 beautiful naked natives waving palm fronds at me and I\\'d still have to run to the tiki-lieu at the drop of a hat.  Crohn\\'s is an immune response to an unknown antigen, it is NOT caused by stress or otherwise poor mental or physical health.  IBD can be caused by those things, so naturally eating better will make you feel better, and voila, no IBD.  Crohn\\'s don\\'t work that way.\\n\\nOne more thing.  I strongly urge all Crohn\\'s people to exercise as mush as possible.  This is for two reasons: 1)For some reason, I NEVER have urgency when I\\'m playing basketball or tennis.  I definitely think it helps reduce the symptoms; and 2) Crohn\\'s will land you in the hospital every now and then, and being in good physical shape may be the difference between how fast you recover and whether you wind up with a bag strapped to your side.  Staying thin also opens up the door for laproscopic surgery, if necessary, which is far less invasive than traditional surgery.\\n\\nFinally, let me say this.  In my book, anyone who is willing to be in a serious relationship with a Crohnnie is a marverous example of a truly good human.  Let me tell you, we can suck to live with, especially if on higher doses of prednisone.  But I can honestly say that my disease has made me appreciate my wife and kids all the more.  It seems weird to say that I\\'m \"proud\" to be a Crohnnie, but man I\\'ve overcome a lot and I\\'m still fighting the good fight.  With the right support and attitude, so will your GF.  Peace.\\nHi Tuf\\n\\nYou are lucky to have escaped surgery. Im my case and many others, unfortunately surgery is the only option, i had severe narrowing, so bad that fluids couldn\\'t pass through my small bowel. I was in constant pain every day and bed ridden for months.\\n\\nI tried the meds, including steroids as i didn\\'t want surgery, but none helped, in the end i had it done and the biopsy showed extensive narrowing, full of ulcers and growths.\\n\\nI agree with the food, nine times out of ten, diets don\\'t help. And many people with Crohn\\'s have to work out what makes it worse for them. This can work in some people, but unfortunately it didn\\'t with me.\\n\\nCrohn\\'s is classed as IBD, inflammatory bowel disease, as it inflames the area to which is affected by the crohn\\'s.  Also, i have found that stress did make my crohn\\'s worse.\\n\\nI agree with when you said it has made you appreciate your family more. I am the same, i appreciate every bit of time i get to spend with them and everything in general about them. It\\'s hard work living with someone with crohn\\'s and when a person has the support they need it makes the crohn\\'s much more managable.\\n\\n\\nI wish you luck with the horrible disease, and i do hope you remain away from the operating table.\\n\\n\\n\\nSharon\\nYes Sharon, you are correct that not everyone is as lucky as me regarding surgery.  The poster has indicated that his GF does not warrant surgery at this point either.\\n\\nThus, I think the best this person can do is to stay in the best physical health they can so as to avoid surgery in the future.  I do think that physically fit people recover much faster from flares and have a reduced risk for needing the surgery.  From what I\\'ve heard from people, if you can avoid surgery you should.  My doctor told me ten years ago I would need the surgery like it or not, and so far I have ten years of proving him wrong.  But that doesn\\'t mean that someday it might not be a reality I\\'ll have to face.  Some people just don\\'t have a choice.\\n\\nBTW, Northwestern Hospital in Chicago does offer a chance at a \"cure\".  They have a program there that basically consists of eliminating your entire immune sytem through complete destruction of white blood cells through chemotherapy.  They then inject you with your own cultured stem cells and you grow back a \"new\" immune system that does not react to the unknow antigen that causes Crohns.  Naturally this is a risky procedure, but it is one I tried to get into.  I was rejected because my conditions were not \"bad enough\" to warrant the procedure.  It is my understanding that a large percentage of people who have undergone this procedure remain in 100% remission, but some people did get symptoms back.  Too early to tell if the procedure results in a 100% cure for those who it works for, but so far it looks like the most promising chance of a cure.\\n\\nI have had Crohn\\'s for 48 years and have had several surgeries. I have 15\" of my small intestine, and half the left side of my large intestine has been removed. It seemed that no one knew what to do so I suffered in silence for about 15 years then a new Dr. came to town and he got me going on different meds until we found one that worked (kinda)  I am now on Immuran and Lomotil and together they work pretty good. I eat no cabbage, no broccilli, no caulliflower , no alcohol, milk only on cereal, very little garlic, (that\\'s the tough one) very little onion. Other than that I seem to manage, soda pop isn\\'t too bad so I do drink some of that. and lots of lemonade. I trust this has been a bit helpful\\nTell her to drinking plenty of water. Caffeinated beverages should be avoided. Omega-3 fatty acids is important. Take Potassium-rich Foods for eg. potatoes, avocados, and bananas.',\n",

       " {'post': \"I am early into this, I was diagnosed on the 21st started taking Asacol HD the next day. I had a bad flare which is what prompted the GI visit. My fever got to 104 and I could not stop the diarrhea for 4 days.\\n\\nRight before that I had pains/a numb feeling in my lower back to lower stomach. I am experiencing that same feeling now, but not everyday. Can you have a bad flare on asacol?\\n\\nI have not had the diarrhea since the flare, but I do have Type 5 stool on bad days. Is this normal, does a flare always need to have diarrhea?\\nhi..do you know the extent of your UC...meaning is it throughout or limited (to where)?\\n\\nJust a basic thing about UC flaring...it starts at the rectum and continues upward.  It heals from up to downward, so the rectum will be the first and the last....think of a thermometer and the bulb area the rectum.\\n\\nWhen one has inflammation, it comes in incriments, one of which is the most obvious of diarrhea,  bleeding, multiple bms, urgency, pain upon having bms, etc.\\n\\nDiarrhea usually happens when the inflammation is extended to high in the rectum/sigmoid and above.\\n\\nIf your bms are more formed or soft and you're having less bms...that inflammation would more than likely be a result of starting to heal and the limitation being in the rectum, or very mild inflammation above and more intense in the rectum.\\n\\nYou're on Asacol HD...it's an oral topical med that is dispursed into the colon.  But it won't treat the rectum effectively.\\n\\nYou should get back to the GI and request mesalamine retention  rectal meds.  If you're in Canada, that would be Salofalk, if you're in the US, that would be Rowasa or generic mesalamine.\\n\\nThe both ends approach is very effective...that's all I've used in 23 years.\\n\\nRecognise these symptoms, for once all is going nicely and your flare is finished, they could be what you should notice when you're starting to flare the next time.\\n\\nThese are symptoms that many miss because they aren't the most obvious.  But like I said, if all is good and a flare is starting... constipation, excessive gas/bloating, rectal discomfort, mucous, etc would mean a flare is happening...it's just limited to the rectum at that point.\\n\\nThink the thermometer going upwards.\\n\\nNow not all have full extensive inflammation, and if you treat flares early with the rectal meds, your flares will be much less intent.  The goal for me is to keep them limited to the lower rectum.\\n\\n\\nq\\nAlso, today I have less gas pain I have more a warm feeling in my lower abdominal. Feels like I should have to go but I can't, from what your saying this was a flare. My problem is I don't know what to expect from a flare and I get nervous when I am not sure what is going on. I will ask my GI at my appointment tomorrow about where my UC is, he told me after the test and sent me home with papers but I was a little knocked out.\\n\\nI was thinking about what you wrote, maybe I am just healing. I am so new at this I don't know what to expect to feel. Thanks for the help, I just want to get to the next 2 days....\\nHealing, but still in a flare....you do need to ask for rectal meds.  Trust me on this, use them now, use them later...better now. Retention enemas would be better than suppositories.\\n\\nThey should be used nightly till all is normal...then tapered to every second night for a while, then every third.\\n\\nThe best maintenance seems to be using them twice a week...but I used to taper to once a week.\\n\\nBasically, our experience is our teacher...what to expect and what we experience can be different.  My suggestion is to pay attention to symptoms, try not to panic and know how to use your meds effectively.\\n\\nFor cramping, I use dicyclomine.  My doc started me off with 10mg, and that was a comfort-saver.\\n\\nq\\n\\nHi again...Hope you are doing better with your UC sysmptoms...The one thing I seem to remember the most was the urgency I began having after a while. I was a severe case and could only get into remission with high doses of steroids. I could start the car in the morning and begin pulling out the of driveway only to have to come back into the house to go to the bathroom. I mapped out every service station, porta potty, fast food and stores with convienient bathrooms any time I had to go somewhere. But I also think everyone is so different with their UC. Milk products didn't seem to bother me, but a touch of chili powder or chocolate would set me off. Flares are the pits. Stay away from alcohol. My gastenterologist explained it was like pouring lemon juice on a cut. The cramping is painful...I like the suggestion of the heating pad or a warm bath. The warm bath also is good for rectal burning some people get from the multiple BM's. It's like having the flu contantly except when you are in remission. Try orange flavored metamucil after each meal if your stools are liquidy...it bulks them up so you don't go so often....Will continue to check in on you...Good luck and hang in there. You never know what to expect from day to day so it is important to just take one day at a time, educate yourself and your family, and remember there are alot of us going through it  with you and we are all here to help you whenever we can.\\n\",\n",

One day you feel fine the next you feel like garbage. One thing my doctor told me was, healing is not a straight line it will be an up and down journey. Stinks I know but what are you going to do, you have it so we have to accept and adapt. As far as the prednisone, from what I was told (I took it for 4 weeks 40 mg down to zero) it is to reduce the swelling and get you to a baseline.

(http://www.lialda.com/) - I started on Asacol and that messed me up bad...this has helped.\\nHi..I would strongly suggest your doc add rectal retention medicaitons to your regimen.  In the US, Rowasa would be the medicaiton.\\n\\nq\\nHi. As a 14 year survivor of Crohn's I can give you a bit of advice. First off, have your GI double and triple check you have UC, not Crohn's. I went 3 years with a mis DX. Next its time to go up the ladder to an immuno or biologic. I know thats not what you want to hear but an immuno or biologic is actually BETTER for your body long term. Pred is terrible. Make plans to get off it as soon as possible. Most of the emotional roller coaster you are feeling is a prednisone side effect (lovely eh?) my docs joke that my husband can move out when they have to put me on pred now because of my attitude. The long term effects of Pred are catastrophic. Something they don't bother to tell you when you get Dxed.\\n\\nSo here's a rough outline of meds that are there, look them up, be knowledgeable go to your doctor knowing something and make him PROVE he knows what he is doing. First line of IBD drugs is Asacol, Rowasa, Pentasa (this is where you are now) Then we move into immunosuppressants Methotrexate, Immuran, and 6mps Then we have Biologics, Humira, Remicade and Tsarbi.  Right now I am on Sulfazalazine (kinda the same as Asacol) and Humira for my gut and basically in remission. It is common to use 2 different types of medications to induce and maintain remission. For instance Remicade and Methotrexate is a common combo. ( I can't take Immunos thats why I am not on one) The best advice I can give you is to become your own advocate. Find support groups, learn everything you can about your illness so you know what your GI is really talking about instead of just taking for granted the guy in the white coat will do the best for you.\\n\\nLastly, it will get better. Yes it's a life long condition but as you learn how to deal with your illness, your triggers and find medications that treat you it does get better.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Would like to \"chat\" with people that suffer from this disease!\\n\\nHi King for a Day,\\nI have Crohns Dz. have had it for 40+ years, Ulcerattive colitis is some what the same as Crohns Dz. It can effect any part of the body from the mouth to the rectum. It\\'s not a simple illness to Dignose, I went through 3 years of testing, back when I had it they called it ileitis, which is at the end of the small bowel. By the time they caught my Dz. I had to have surgery and 4 feet of the small bowel removed. (but that is another story)\\nI am now 55 years old, dignosed at age 8, so I have gone though my life with this. All I know is the doctors just kept shoving pills at me and nothing worked, now I am in somewhat of a remmission. I learned that diet plays a large role in this Dz. and dairy products are the worst. I have not had milk since I was 13, it is hard to go without some of your favs but if it makes you feel better and your not runing to the potty all the time it is worth it. Stress is a major factor, if your stressed out all the time about it the flares seem to come more often. Try to relax and meditate, your brain is a very powerful tool. I have learned to control my diet and just stop worry all the time. I have actually gain 10 pounds and look better than I have in years. I was always very thin and pale.\\nKeep your chin up and just try altering your diet. Try something for a few days if it bothers you then stop and then try again, do this with red meats and foods that make you bloat, like cabbage, onions, green peppers ect... I really hate the bloating part it makes me look like I am 12 months pregnant LOL. I hope this has helped alittle. If you have any questions I will try to answer them, I am not a doctor but my husband says I know alot about this DZ I could almost be one. I have lived my life with it and finally after all these years I feel better, worry less and don\\'t stress over it. It is hard to find what works for you but keep trying. I hope this has helped alittle, you will get better, promise..........\\nThank you so much for your reply.  I don\\'t think you could ever know how much you have inspired me\\nYou are an angel.  I was diagnosed 8wks ago and of course the tests and appointments take a while to get through so the suffering had been going on for months.  I felt like I was dying, I have never felt so weak and fatigued on top of all the \"yucky\" symptoms.  They put me on 6 wks of Asacol 800 which took more than three weeks to begin making a difference but at the end of the 6wks told me to stop and see what happens.....easy for them to say.  Within three weeks the symptoms were back full force and in addition I have been under two weeks of extreme stress.  I had researched and learned about many things that I should do but you have convinced me that the steps I have taken will make a difference and this will be a thing of the past. At the moment it just feels like it will never end so your response was perfect timing.  THANK YOU I will let you know how things progress.\\nHi, I hope things go well for you and you feel better soon. Your kind words mean alot to me, if I can help just one person suffering from this DZ. it\\'s worth everything. Please let me know how you are doing and I will keep you in my prayers.\\nKing..what medications are you on at this point and where is your UC located...limited or throughout?\\n\\nq\\nHi q,\\nThey were not able to get to the upper third of the colon due to the inflammation.  I have to go back in October to try again.  In the lower colon and rectum there was moderate to mild UC and some areas showed Crohns.  They put me on Asacol 800 x 6 a day for six weeks.  It took 3 wks to begin working...after the six they told me to stop taking the meds and see what happens.  I was ok for 3 weeks however dealing with a lot of stress and then it came back full force.  The worst part for me is the pain in the \"butt\" area and extreme fatigue.  I have done a lot of research about stress and diet but have not had the chance to see any benefits yet.  I can see how a person could become depressed dealing with this and if it is mild or moderate I have trouble imagining what a severe case would be like.\\nThanks for you interest.  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.\\nHi...actually UC and CD don\\'t happen together, it\\'s one or the other.   I would suspect the \"colitis\" diagnosis suspecting to be Crohn\\'s means Crohn\\'s Colitis.\\n\\nWill the doc be setting you up for a small bowel follow -through to determine if there\\'s any inflammation there?\\n\\nAre there any other tests you\\'ve had done?\\n\\nDo you have a copy of your biopsies report?\\n\\nI\\'m puzzled that you have no rectal meds in your regimen considering where your inflammation is.  The oral meds will NOT treat the lower part of the colon or rectum.  Definitely something to get back to your doctor about.\\n\\nfood intake is subjective, it\\'s difficult when one has inflammation in the colon since most everything will be rushed out quickly.\\nFood won\\'t heal your inflammation, but if you eat for comfort, foods that are less likely to cause excess gas, cramping and discomfort would be best, at least in your waking hours.\\n\\nWhat\\'s your diet like at this point?\\n\\nq\\nHi q, That makes sense! It confused me a little too. He was going through a list of all the sections the biopsied and there was only one area he used the word Crohn\\'s.  Thanks for making sense of that........the overall diagnosis was \"Mild to Moderate Ulcerative Colitis\".\\nI am going to call my Dr. Monday and request rectal medication as that is where 80% of my discomfort is right now.\\nThe tests that were done were blood tests, endoscopy, colonoscopy, and finally feces culture.\\nAt first I removed most fibre from my diet, reduced milk products and did not eat red meat or raw vegetables.  When they removed me from the meds I went back to a normal diet which I think was a big mistake.  Because the symptoms came back with such force I have now placed myself on the \"diet\" and am being very strict about it, in addition I am keeping a food journal and have made an appointment with a dietitian to discuss proper supplements.  I have also researched meditation and have enrolled in Yoga.  I have look at the stresses I can control and taken steps to remove and reduce all possible.  I have explained to my family that my system just cant deal with large stresses and they will have to step in more to deal with things.\\nI think I was hoping it was just a little problem when diagnosed and that I could control it and it would\\'nt be a major thing ...... when it came back to this degree I felt the full impact physically and mentally.  I have really had to force myself to look to the positive and \"suck it up\" that this is a big part of my life now.  Time to take care of Me!\\nThanks for your feedback......I can\\'t tell you how \"uplifting\" it is to talk with people that have suffered and experienced the same or worse.\\nq\\nActually, U.C. Crohns DZ are all IBS. It will do well to watch your diet and stress level no matter were your IBS is located. It is a DZ that is very diffcult. Do you suffer for IBS? Food will not heal your inflammation, but it will help not to eat the foods that causes things to flare, when food passes through the infected area thats were the pain comes from, clear liquids, then soft foods and then trial and era with other food always helped me during a flare, I have lived with it (IBS) Crohns whatever for 40+ years, there is no cure but a change in life style may be the key for us that suffer from IBS.....\\n^^Actually, they are both Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.  not IBS.\\nOne can have IBS with either UC or CD.\\n\\nI have Ulcerative Colitis limited to rectosigmoid area, diagnosed over 22 years ago.  My treatment/maintenance is oral/rectal 5ASA.\\n\\nFood for UC compared to CD is different depending on where one\\'s CD is.  Since it can happen anywhere from mouth to anus (not rectum) and affect the entire wall of the digestive tract not just the mucosal and submucosal lining as in UC, there can are different issues that can arise.\\n\\nFood...subjective as I mentioned.  It\\'s a learning process.  One needs to make sure that medications cover the both ends approach with UC, since it starts at the rectum and continues upward.\\n\\nq\\nKing, you need to get a copy of the biopsies, it will state in common with or follows the pattern of, or something like that.\\n\\nRegarding the CD suggestion, you might be in the area of indeterminate where it\\'s not clear...but that diagnosis usually ends up being CD anyway.  If CD follows the pattern of UC, where the rectum (not anus) is involved and there are no skip patterns, it\\'s difficult to know until the disease shows further traits.\\n\\nYou should never have been taken off medications, i\\'m puzzled by that, for a \"let\\'s see what happens\".. makes no sense to me.\\n\\nMake a list of questions...I can help you with that..for you to ask your doctor for a more definitive lead on what\\'s happening, where it is located exactly, plans for the future medications, how they work, etc.\\n\\nRegarding stress relief, food intake, etc....trying your best to make it as balanced as possible helps.\\n\\nq\\nKing,\\nI am sorry if q and I are confusing you. IBS is \"Irritated Bowel Syndrome\" as explained by my gastro. whom I been seeing for 18 years now. CD,UC anything that effects the bowels, ( small or large).Mine is located in the small bowel, which I had 4 feet of it removed because back in the day when I found out I had it that was all they could do, now I suffer from skip areas that\\'s were my diet plays a large role. I wish you the best and  \"diet\" for me is the key. Again everyone has there opinion on how to manage there bowel problems, to this day it is a mystery on how, where, when it all came to be. Please take care of yourself and feel better soon.\\nI am wondering if part of the problem is that is still the General Surgeon that completed the tests that is making medication and further test decisions at this point.  Perhaps I should be seeing a specialist for treating the disease now that it has been diagnosed.  What type of doctor would specialize in the treatment of the disease?  This is my first question for him when I go back.  I am scheduled to go in October but am now thinking of making an appointment in the next few weeks to discuss my medications since you mentioned the rectal medications and how much discomfort I am still in. My second will be to request a copy of the report as you mentioned.  Did I mention how much I appreciate your feedback?\\n\\nHi..you need to see a gastroenterologist.  Why were you initially sent to a general surgeon, to do your c-scope?\\n\\nI caution you one thing...to not have anyone put you on prednisone at this point.  This is my own opinion, but it\\'s a strong one.\\n\\nSo...you aren\\'t on any medication at this point?\\n\\nDo you have a GP?  and is it he/she that sent you to the general surgeon?\\n\\nYou are most welcome for the replies...I have lots more questions, however..lol.\\n\\nJust to make it clear regarding Saddie\\'s post, UC and CD are not under the category of IBS (mechanical dysfunction of the colon), They are IBD (organic diseases, some school of thought believes them to be autoimmune).  Two different entities entirely.\\n\\nq\\nHi q,\\nThanks for making sure the distinguishing differences between the IBS and IBD.  I am an information freak..case you didn\\'t notice.  I believe that knowledge is power, so I immediately joined the Crohn\\'s and Colitis Foundation to receive all the information they had available...an they had a lot both online and mailed.  However they do not have a active support group in my area which provides the interaction with people that are dealing with the disease.\\nBecause of Dr. shortages and the fact that I am stubborn and do not go to the Dr. until absolutely necessary... I could not get into my doctor and ended up in urgent care.  Normally this is not the ideal place to be with anything other than a cold or flu, the doctor I saw was fabulous, he did no examination just listened to what was happening and told me he wanted to have thorough examination of my gastrointestenal system as soon as possible.  He referred me to the Reimer Clinic for the tests.....which they have been great through the diagnosis steps but I am wondering how effective in treating my symptoms.  I have an appointment with my GP Sept 7th, the first appointment I could get\\n\\nMy biggest concern in the immediate ..... and sorry its yucky to talk about but I\\'m sure you are understand...is the large amount of muscous that come out.  Every bowel movement which is approx 3 - 7 a day has some stool, small bits of blood and mostly mucous.  It just doesn\\'t seem right... it seems like my insides are falling to pieces and coming out.  I know that is not the case....its just very unpleasant and hard to get your mind positive and stop worrying when it is so constant.\\nSo Counting the days until a doctor can see me and then I will talk about the rectal medication you mentioned as currently I am only being treated with Asacol 800 x 6 a day.\\nDid you find any relief with taking Tylenol for the cramps and rectal discomfort?',\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi! I'm brand new to this board. I was dx with a C Difficile infection in Nov 2011, and then in Dec 2011, diagnosed with Crohn's.\\n\\nFour days ago, I started the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) with the intention of curing (or helping) my Crohn's. On the second day, my GI called to tell my I tested positive for the C Diff toxin again, but my stool sample was negative for the bacteria. He told me he doesn't know whether or not my stomach bleeding is due to C Diff or Crohn's. He gave me a choice of taking Vancomycin again for the third time for C Diff, or Prednisone for Crohn's, which I've never tried. The main reason I'm doing the SCD diet is because my GI never seems to give me a straight answer, and I'm very sick and willing to try anything.\\n\\nI have lots of questions about all of these things, but maybe there is someone out there who has had recurring C Diff and knows a succesful way to treat it! Thanks all.\\n\\nHi, I am a 14 year Crohn's sufferer. First off I would like to say there is no cure for crohns. Diet can effect symptoms but will not alter the course of the disease. I have read the SCD Diet and it would cause so many symptoms for me I would wind up in the hospital. One of the first thing you need to do when you find out you have Crohn's is find your personal trigger foods. They are different for everyone. My personal ones are fiber, seeds, nuts all the time then more foods are added the sicker I am. I strongly suggest starting a food diary. To see what triggers your symptoms. My GI tests me for C diff every time I flare. C diff will act just like crohn's for symptoms. It seems to me that you may not have crohn's at all but a tough case of C diff. How did they determine you had crohns? what tests? Is it possible someone around you is a carrier of C diff and keeps reinfecting you? It is highly contagious. I have never been on the medication for C diff. BUT I have been on LOTS of prednisone. Use it with care, last resort type thing. Doctors seem to want to push prednisone fast on newly DXed patients because it can stop symptoms fairly quickly, but it is NOT a long term medication. It does severe damage to your body over the long term. Osteoporosis, Mania, Weight gain, Acne, Moon Face and metaboloic changes just to name a few. I wish I had never seen prednizone at this point.\",\n",

I was released home and felt great.\\n\\nBut about a week ago I felt weird again. Not to the same extent as before but I just felt weaker and tired. I started developing neck pain and joint pain and my stools started to occur with cramps again and I experience weakness.\\n\\nMy MAIN concern is this: I am really struggling with the chills and fever. I get these chills at the same time everyday (evening) and they last maybe a half hour. THEN I get a fever of about 103 degrees F and its terrible.

As soon as I stopped taking them, I started feeling better.  It was pretty scary and now whenever something feels \"off\"  I immediately think of what new drugs I\\'m taking that could be causing the problem.\\nYou need to call your Dr. ASAP. Fever that high indicates infection. They missed something in the hospital. Joint pain is normal with Crohn\\'s, but the fever is not. Also getting this treated before it gets any worse is in your best intrest. You didn\\'t mention medications so I assume you are not on any?',\n",

That is exactly what the report from my sigmoidoscopy and biopsy said, \"unspecific\", meaning they didn\\'t know what caused it.\\n\\nSince then, I have been taking Salofalk enemas, which have helped a lot and basically enabled me to lead a normal life. I\\'m quite lucky, because generally my symptoms are relatively easy to handle (blood in stool, slight cramps occasionally, mucus in stool, nothing major though, all of which disappear quickly when I medicate).\\n\\nHowever, in the entire time I was suffering these symptoms before diagnosis, there were times when I would also pass undigested food. This has carried on post-diagnosis too.\\n\\nI have spoken to my GP, who informed me that there is always the possibility of such things with something like Proctitis, due to a general disruption of the digest tract, but I\\'m not so sure. It seems a little odd, especially that the diagnosis itself was \"unspecific\" in terms of the genesis of this disease.\\n\\nIn truth I don\\'t really get any of the symptoms of the other, more troubling IBDs (never lost weight, never been anaemic, never been sick, exhausted or lost my appetite, even in the middle of a flair up), but the passing of undigested food and generally \"abnormal\" looking bowel movements when it happens (increase in volume, slightly lighter brown, not clay coloured, or even sandy, just a very slightly lighter brown than usual) has lead me to believe that I might suffer from something that is as yet undetected (maybe IBS).\\n\\nOr am I being paranoid? Should I expect to see faster transit times in my stool now that I suffer from UP and is it something I should get used to?\\n\\nAnother thing I should mention is a nagging discomfort at the bottom of my right rib, radiating through to the back, which seems to come and go and which has recently been potentially linked a slight case of GERD.

They immediatley put me on steroids and admitted me to the hospital. 3 days later,once the inflammation was down, they performed a colonoscopy and endoscopy. Upon this procedure they found a small imflamed portion of my colon, and after the biopsy results, concluded it was neither ulcerative colitis or chrons. Has anyone gone through this before? Could the steroids have masked my problem before the doctor was able to diagnose? Any suggestions or comments are appreciated. : )\\n\\nNo the steroids just got down the inflammation in order to have a colonoscopy. You don't want them poking around while its upset to start. But after that, they should have determined whether it was chrons, or Ulcerative colitis.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hello,\\n\\n\\nI am new to this board and hoping someone will be able to provide some advice. Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this.\\n\\nI’ve been through the archived posts on this site hoping to find other people who have experienced a fissure while having an active bout of Colitis (or Chrons). I’ve had Colitis for 6 years, but this is my first fissure. The combination of these two problems is making my life miserable. I’m currently having BM’s about 8-10 times a day and it is so painful. I saw my family physician who prescribed steroid and nitroglyerine creams. I’ve been using them for about a week and taking sitz baths as much as possible but things do not seem to be improving. Is this normal? How long does it take to heal on average?\\n\\nMany fissure patients seem to spend a lot of time focusing on relieving constipation. This is clearly not my problem! I wonder how it will heal when I am having BM’s as frequently as I do? Should I try fasting? I’d love any advice. I have an appointment with my GI specialist, but it will not occur for 3 week (sadly, there are long waitlists here.)\\n\\nAnother question -- a skin tag has appeared since the fissure pain began. Does this mean that I’m more likely to have a chronic fissure that will not heal without surgery?\\n\\nI’m getting married in two months and the thought of going through this on my wedding day/honeymoon makes be cry….\\n\\nThanks again for any advice.\\nHi\\n\\nI have UC and I have a fissure right now...I got mine from hard stool so I added more fiber and lots of water; they can also be a problem (as in your case) when you push too hard...try exhaling when you go (even if its watery stool) to relieve the pressure. I hope you get into remission soon .\\n\\nThanks X51. I\\'ll try that.\\nArabesque - I wonder if you are reading this thread 6 months later and how you are feeling. I went UC 18 months ago with a MRSA infection in my intestines tipping my condition into motion. The violent diarrhea (at its worst, 12-14 times a day, all hours) caused rectal prolapse, plus I already had a hypertrophied papilla. The explosive BMs eventually ruptured the surface tissue of my anus and I developed multiple, long fissures that I still have. So, I have to push in a papilla after every BM (always abbreviated because of the pain and prolapse of the papilla) past the inflamed fissures. I use emu and tea tree oil as well as natural baby wipes to ease the process.\\n\\nI empathize so much with your post because with UC, the fissures are not about constipation. The UC sufferer has episodes of uncontrollable peristalsis (not that you should be controlling as in forcing or squeezing of course, but sheer \"violent\" spasms and loose if not diarrhea-like stools). This burst of a BM rips open healing wounds.\\n\\nSo, how did I get from a stress level of 10 down to a 3? (I did not mention this before, but what was once horrific is now tolerable).\\n\\nI believe that I am not a 1 (or 0!) mainly because I lose discipline with the first 2 items. I have a few weeks where all is cool, then a few weeks where I am miserable and thank God I am self employed and don\\'t have to show up to a job (i.e. I cannot comfortably leave the house).\\n\\nI do not take drugs for this.\\n\\nI am looking to get my papilla removed but am nervous so seeking a world class surgeon for the task.\\n\\nWhen I had my colonoscopy I had horrific fissures and rectal prolapse. The next few days were extraordinarily painful.\\n\\nPlease contact me or post here so we can keep the info flowing.\\n\\nM\\n\\nHello,\\n\\nHopefully your situation has turned for the better!\\n\\nMy girlfriend which has been suffering from colitis over the past 3 years has fallen into a somewhat similar situation you are/have been going trough!\\n\\nAny advise coming from your part would be most welcome and appreciated.\\n\\nOver the past six weeks, when the fissure became reality, my girlfriend is losing mental strength, while cries herself to sleep almost every night because of the pain which comes along with it.\\n\\nAlthough it acts like a drain on me too, I’m off course far from living the drama she experiences right now, other than to support her, I looking for people who are dealing with these same issues in order find a way to find the best possible solution in order to fight and cure for the fissure.\\n\\nIf by any chance you could share any ideas on how to handle her case, we would be very thankful to receive whatever information to bring relief. Even negative news would be helpful in order to cut down the illusions we might have upon this situation.\\n\\nTo recap:\\n\\nFissure came up six weeks ago.\\n\\nSeen specialist which prescribed meds which didn’t worked.\\n\\nTwo weeks ago she had a Botox treatment which at first seemed to relief the\\npain a bit, but after 7 days things got back on the downfall.\\n\\nShe will see her doctor again in 6 days, which is a long time considering the circumstances.\\n\\nThe biggest problem off all we assume to be the colitis off course, although she cleans the wound after every bathroom visit, which are approximately between 7 and 12 visits a day, the pain is becoming less and less bearably while it affects her mind state.\\n\\nI can but witness she is struggling to keep her hoops up.\\n\\nAnyone, any help please!\\n\\nOther than that I wish you all the best and recovery!\\n\\nThanks anyhow,\\n\\nSincerely yours,\\n\\nChristophe\\nHi Christophe,\\n\\nI\\'m sorry to hear about your girlfriend -- it\\'s such a difficult thing to go through.\\n\\nThankfully, my fissure did eventually heal. After seeing a specialist, he recommended a different topical medication. I forget the name of the drug right now, but it was much more effective than the nitro (and it didn\\'t cause headaches.) I\\'ll look for the prescription and post of the name of the drug if I find it.\\n\\nIt look about 8-10 weeks to fully heal once I started on the second medication. During that time, I look a lot of warm baths to relax the muscles and soothe the pain. If I was at home, I took a bath after every bowel movement. I also tried to take deep breaths and relax as much as possible during a bowel movement -- exhaling deeply helped with this. I was so tense in anticipation of the pain that I think it made things much worse. Knowing that I could jump into a warm bath afterwards made it easier to relax as well.\\n\\nA few weeks after I started on the second medication I received a blood transfusion as my iron and hemoglobin levels were very low. I really believe this helped my fissure heal as iron plays a role in wound healing. If your girlfriend is anemic (which is common among collitis patients), she may want to consider taking supplements.\\n\\nI hope that helps a bit. I also spent many nights crying because of the pain and got quite depressed. I really hope things improve for her soon.\\nHello Arabesque,\\n\\nFirst of all I would like to thank you for the reply you send me, it’s much appreciated!\\n\\nI believe my girlfriend is taking the nitro, the doctor told her she would probably suffer from headaches, surprisingly she didn’t suffer from any until now. It would be cool if you could find out about the other drug you have used, maybe it has the same effect which could result in curing the fissure.\\n\\nUntil one year ago my girlfriend was seeing one doctor, to be honest, he really messed her up big time, at one certain point she became so weak she had to stop working. Because of coincidence she got in touch with another doctor who checked her levels, after reading the blood results he was a bit stunned she could still move around.\\n\\nEverything she was missing, she is now receiving on a monthly basis (I don’t know the correct word, but we call it baxter, these plastic bags filled with liquid ;-) to restore her (overall) levels which have quickly come back to balance.\\n\\nShe has gained no success upon solving the colitis but regardless of that she was feeling way better than with the treatment of the other doctor. Which is already a good thing.\\n\\nThe fact she has to face a new challenge into curing this fissure is a sad situation within an already difficult living. I will explain her about the breathing when she needs to visit the bathroom, any tips like the one you brought up are welcome in this stage, so thanks again for taking the time to write me!\\n\\nMy girlfriend doesn’t like to go to site’s or forums where they discuss the illness she is suffering from, she told me it puts her down to read about people who are in a same situation, I understand her reasoning behind this, that’s why I’m doing all the surfing around.\\n\\nWish you a fine health,\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nChristophe\\nHi Christophe,\\n\\nIt\\'s my pleasure. When I had my fissure I did so much research on fissures and ulcerative colitis, and I couldn\\'t really find anything. I\\'m happy to answer any questions you have.\\n\\nI found my second prescription, it is \"2% Diltiazem in vaseline\". This one was much better for me. I hope it is available where you are.\\n\\nI\\'m glad your girlfriend has found a better doctor. I have good doctors, but unfortunately I\\'ve never really been able to get my colitis under control. Because I\\'ve been living with it for over 10 years now, I\\'ve found some ways to cope though. For example, having good iron levels are key, finding what foods are easier for you to digest help (and stay away from coffee!), and I try to eat yogurt with probiotics everyday.\\n\\nAlso, when things are bad and I can\\'t afford to stay home all day, I\\'ll take a Tylenol 1 (which contains codeine). We can purchase T1\\'s without a prescription where I live. The codeine slows down your system, so I\\'ll get over 5-6 hours without a bowel movement. While I\\'d rather not take more drugs, sometimes this is the only way I can cope. My doctors know that I do this and they are fine with it (as long as I\\'m not abusing them.)\\n\\nI really hope things improve for her soon. Feel free to ask as many questions as you like -- I\\'m happy to provide my perspective. Please let me know how things work out for her.',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hello,\\n\\nI am new to the IBD Board, but several years ago used to frequent the IBS Board under Desertflower1993. I am so confused and scared right now,i don\\'t know how to get this out. I had a scope in 2006 due to alot of symptoms and blood. The GI Doc found 2 precancerous polyps,Diverticulosis,Redundancy of Colon and some Internal Hemorrhoids. I was to come back in 3 years for repeat scope, which I didn\\'t. I was 35 at the time. I did go back due to symptoms worsening, changing etc, but he blew me off and said live with it your IBS is worsening, here\\'s some more Bentyl..... It had gotten to the point that I didn\\'t want to eat because i became afraid of a \"flare\". When I had one, which my symptoms would range from IBS-A, gas, cramps, pain and very tender to the touch whole abdomen. I would stop eating for 2 or 3 days and it would get better. For the last 2 years, I can count on one hand any blood I have had. Which was good. FAST FORWARD 2 WEEKS AGO. I have to say that i\\'m in a new state, in a small town, so the last GI is history. Anyhoo, I wake up at around 2:30 in the morning, hurting, run to the bathroom and have what I call diapation(where you have slow diarrhea and are begging for more to come out). I sat there for 3 hours in severe pain, cold sweat, trying not to pass out and then get up, try to get to my bed, never make it there because the feeling of still having to go is unbelievable. I run back and behold here comes the blood. 8 bloody bouts. I feel horrible, get to a doc who puts me in the hospital. and i\\'m running 100.9 fever. CT scan shows Circumferential Wall thickening of the Sigmoid, Descending and Distal Transverse Colon with Moderate pericolonic stranding consistent with Colitis. They start IV\\'ing me with Flagyl and Cipro the next day. In the mean time my blood counts are dropping etc... I managed to get out after 5 days, still on Cipro and have a scope and an upper endoscopy scheduled. I have never had anything like this bout, with the fever, blood counts etc.. MY QUESTION IS THIS. The doc is a General Surgeon, He says UC does not cause wall thickening, but I keep reading that it does. He says Crohns is a better fit, but it is not on the right side of my colon. The Primary care doc is saying Colitis and the scan showed Colitis. I am scared it\\'s cancer, they both say no. I am confused and terrified. Please, what do you guys think??????????? HELP ME! I am doing much better now with all the IV antibiotics and the Cipro they sent home with me. Just tired. On the last day I was there, my blood counts started to come up a little and they did test my stools-negative and test for C-Diff-negative. I don\\'t know what to think. Thank you for reading.\\nHi...colitis is a general term for colon inflammation.  Ulcerative colitis isn\\'t usually diagnosed via CT scan.  Wall thickening would be mild in UC, but definitely more prominent in CD.  CD can happen anywhere in the digestive tract from mouth to anus...so the fact that it\\'s not on the right side would have no bearing on that possible diagnisis.\\n\\nThe pericolic stranding leans towards a few things from my research.\\n\\nIf your rectum isn\\'t involved it seems CD is more the camp you\\'d be in.\\n\\nWhen you were checked for c.diff...did you have only one test?  Were you on the antibiotics previous to the test?\\n\\nYou have a LOT going on in your colon...you need a good GI who can give you answers.  You also need to make sure that the GI takes TONS of biopsies of your colon and removes any polyps for sure.\\n\\nDo you have any colon cancer in your family?\\n\\nI would be as scared and confused as you are.  I believe that the research you\\'re doing is important, albeit causing more frightening possibilities.  Arm yourself with appropriate questions and try to keep it all in perspective as to the fact that you are now in the process of having the testing done with the specialist.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t like the answers finding another GI might be in order.\\n\\nDo the research to find a good GI, research the one you\\'re going to.  When you go...be wise and efficient in asking your questions to get the answers you need that are definitive.\\n\\nPlease keep us posted for sure!\\nquincy',\n",

By recently, I mean this morning.\\n\\nI've had off and on stomach upsets, and bouts of constipation and diary along with some levels of pain, but thought nothing of it.  But roughly two months ago there was blood every day, repeated time during the day.  I have been losing weight for a while, but thought nothing of that either, due to my active lifestyle.  But the blood was a red flag, I got in to see a doctor after 2 weeks of it and he did blood work and labs on stool, getting no results.  He prescribed prednisone, and started on the process of ordering a colonoscopy.\\n\\nThe prednisone made my symptoms worse and I had an allergic reaction, and was doing as horrible as could be, until getting off it.  The colonoscopy results revealed nothing at first when he looked, but the biopsies revealed colitis.\\n\\nSo, here's a new dilemma, meds.  I had meds.  All the stupid meds that I've ever been prescribed seem to make me worse.  So I'm looking into alternative medicine, holistic, natural, etc.  I'm planning on taking Align, Omega-3, Folic Acid and St. John's Wort.  I've been researching things I can do, and these all seemed to have very positive results.  I also eat pretty healthy, don't drink alcohol, quit smoking . . . so what else?\\n\\nAny suggestions for natural methods?\\nColitis as in ulcerative colitis?\\n\\nWhere exactly is it...limited to where or is it throughout?\\n\\nWhat EXACTLY are the meds the doctor has you on now?\\n\\nq\\nI do not know, yet.

I know that it can take years to really diagnose Crohn's, and I wanted to know if the symptoms are always about the same as the ones that you start out with durning flare-ups or do they tend to get worse befor treatment can begin. Also I was hoping that someone could tell me what may have triggered your crohn's? Was it from getting the flu and over reacting to the virus or did Crohn's just kinda came on without warning? It would be great if someone could help me out here! ^.^ Thanks, andi.\\n\\nWould you please be a bit more clear in your question...have you seen a GI specialist?  have you had a c-scope?\\n\\nCrohn's is an autoimmune disease, but as far as a trigger to set it into action..difficult.  It's in your genetic make-up, either inherited or the tendency.\\n\\nq\\nI have seen a GI. He's been a big help\\nbut I've only seen him a handful of time. I have had endoscope and CT scan and the usual stuff done. My main question is what is crohn's like in the very beginning and how crohn's Can progress.\\nWell, there's tons of info on the internet....have you had a colonoscopy?\\nHas the doctor suspected you have CD?\\n\\nYou would have specific areas of inflammation...CD can be anywhere from the mouth to the anus, can happen in separate areas at the same time.\\n\\nThe most common area is in the ileum.\\n\\nOne would probably have loose stool, pain, possibly bleeding, weight loss depending on where, sometimes strictures.\\n\\nCD affects all the layers of the digestive tract, but would start on the mucosal layer.\\n\\nThe treatments can be 5ASA medications, prednisone/steroids (either topical or systemic) depending on where it's located, immunosuppressant meds or biologic immunomodulator meds.\\n\\nWhat symptoms are you having and what did the doctor diagnose you with?\\nWhere are your areas of inflammation....etc?\\n\\nTo sum up your last question, yes...CD can worsen...either without treatment or even with treatment.  Some require surgery to remove the areas that do not go into remission.  In doing that, however, there's no guarantee it won't show up elsewhere in the digestive tract.\\n\\nhope this helps.\\nq\\nCrohn's symptoms may be visible prior to diagnose are intestinal pain and also retardation of growth in the children..\\nI have not had a colonoscopy yet. And my doctor says that CD is a possibility, he really isn't to concerned right know but says if this thing continues he may run some new test. I have read a lot about CD and I know what it is and the symptoms. What I don't know is how people WITH CD felt like when they first showing signs of CD. I want to know if CD can get worse without proper medication and treatments.\\nyes, you can get worse without meds...but one can have CD without knowing it for a long time before diagnosis or troubles.\\n\\nWhat symptoms exactly are you having?\\n\\nHas the doc done blood tests as well...for autoimmune disease, inflammation levels, etc?\\n\\nq\\n\\nI have been having abdominal pain, nausea,a LOT of rumbling, movement and gurgling in my lower abdomen. And just in the last two month been having very irregular bowel movements.\\n\\nMy pain is normally lower than my stomach and to the right(my right) and normally the pain is in the morning, at night and sometimes in the afternoon after I eat. Its not right away, when I get the pain its normaly an hour sometimes more.\\n\\nThe nausea is almost always right before the pain. A few months ago the docter had prescribed something to help with the nausea. It helped a lot with controling the feeling to puke when ever i felt sick\\n\\n\\nSince I have had this for so long I Really believe that I'm getting used to the pain and nausea. I'm a really tuff cookie so when I'm in my bed with pain its really bad. All I want is for this thing to get better T.T it really is wearing me down.\\n\\nOh! and I have had blood tests done but they were from the first few months of this whole ordeal. Idk if my bloods still is the same XD\\nHi, I have had crohns for 5 years, my personal experiance of it was really bad, blood out of my back passage, vomiting, loss of apatite, weight loss, no energy. and constantly on the toilet. it came out of nowhere, and it was my second pregnancy that seemed to trigger it off, they tried to treat mine accordingly, but I have had an illiostomy now, as it was ruling my life, I am still classed as a crohns patient but am a very healthy one, but they claim there are treatments that can put you in to remission, and I have seen loads of people go in to remission, I had a treatment called infliximab (not sure if i have spelt that right) that is a very good one i used it for a while.\\n\\nThey say most crohns sufferers have to have surgical treatment in the first ten years, and I have found it the most effective form,\\n\\nThe nhs website is a wealth of information,\\n\\nWould you say that your crohns is normal or mild ect.? I have read up a lot about crohns and the info that I get is very generic . If I did have crohns would it get worse over time? I'm concered that if I do have crohns that my symptoms will get worse. Since I have had these symptoms for so long I know them like the back of my hand, and I am very concerend because they are starting to change. Did your symptoms change after awhile or did they stay the same? I'm only 15 and I am . I just need some answers to reassure me that what I have is not some very serious.\\n\\nhi, yes the signs and symptoms did change, usually when it was getting better or worse, i found it very important to tell my GP when this was happening so they could react accordangly, I would say mine was very aggressive.\\n\\nanyone with crohns will have 'flare up's'  a period of time where it is really bad that is normal, but it is treatable you just need to find the right medication, have you seen a doctor for tests yet?\\n\\nI have a GI that I've been seeing, and we have ran tests. I have not had a colonoscopy yet. And from what other people have told me thats the main test that helped them get diagnosed. I had my blood and stool test at the very beginning. I think my stool has changed since then. And I think I have flare ups. I feel like crap a lot, which is normal, but I Have really bad episodes periodically. They are really bad, all of my symptoms hit at once, its very scary. I am sometimes scared to go to the bathroom!\\n\\nthe only real way i know of to tell is that test., was not my fave bit but it ment that they could treat me., have they told you anything yet? You sound like all you have is information of the internet and some sketchy maybe's off the medical staff.?\\n\\nMy GI doctor diagnosed me with IBS then Functional Dyspepsia. He said that if I don't see any change, and my bowels keep acting the way they are, he will do the test and check for Crohn's. I really don't want to have to get to that point, but I'm so tired of nothing working. I feel like my meds are really not doing anything. The only change that I see in me is that I'm getting use to my symptoms\\nRight now, sitting at my computed in pain and horrible nausea, and really wish it would stop.\\nI would say its time to have  a scope done and find out for sure what you have..Are you seeing a gastrologist?  They can also do a blood test called a prometheus blood test that can show markers in your blood that help determine if its crohn's ask about that.  I have had crohn's for over 40 years..3 bowel resections. so far..\",\n",

So far, five years after diagnosis, this has kept things pretty well in check.\\nWhere exactly is your CD?  Good you\\'re doing well regarding that.  But I don\\'t think your issue is necessarily because of CD.\\n\\nI can relate to how you feel, although not necessarily after eating.  Sometimes before if I\\'ve gone too long between meals.  Actually I feel how you describe a lot, I actually equate a lot of it to sore muscles, tension, sinus sensitivities, anxiety, etc.  Massage helps.\\n\\n\\nYou should, however, have blood tests done, your blood pressure taken, sugar levels, thyroid, etc and tell your doctor how you\\'re feeling.

Sometimes pressure on the vagas nerve can cause weird feelings... I wonder if it\\'s that?\\n\\nq\\nInteresting ideas about the vagus nerve. I just have a feeling that when I begin food digestion, I get all these weird feelings. I did have this previously and attributed it to the iodine die used during testing. After I discovered that I had iodine in my multi-vitamin, I switched vitamins to have one without and began to feel much better. I even had thyroid testing because they thought my thyroid was off. Turned out it was after affects from the iodine die. No more iodine die for me.\\n\\nI don\\'t have any dietary restrictions really. I eat pretty much what I want because one day it makes me feel terrible and the next day I\\'m fine with it - salad for example - one day bad, a week later, just fine.\\n\\nYes, I think I need to go for an overall checkup and do some blood work.\\nWow, iodine...interesting.  I think there are some foods higher in iodine, maybe searching a list out of curiosity would be a good thing for observance and if you do eat them.\\n\\nDefinitely let me know how you\\'re doing.  I think some of us just feel crappy and are reactive more \"willy nilly\".  The fact that there\\'s no consistency regarding a trigger can be most frustrating.  But, that doesn\\'t mean to not test for some things.\\n\\nA few weeks ago I felt totally crappy all of a sudden.  I thought my heart was racing or my pulse was going wacky and I had a headache.  Not that any of those have never happened before, but it was so sudden.\\n\\nMy husband suggested for me to take my blood pressure.  To my shock it was 160/90!!  I soon should make that appointment with my doc to enquire and get checked. My pulse was fine..68.  So, I have questions regarding the why...have to do the research.

       " {'post': 'I was just diagnosed with Ulcerative colitis a month ago and I am still wondering how this could of happened.  I have analyzed everything that changed in my day to day routine looking for a culprit.  My wife has also has similar symptoms which led me to believe it had to be something we both used or ate.  I have narrowed it down to the toothpaste (Arm & Hammer Whitening Advance).  I know it sounds strange but upon reading the label it said if ingested contact a doctor.  This is the only thing that I could think of.  I am 42 years old, healthy and in good shape.  I have never been hospitalized which makes this harder for me.  Just looking for answers.\\nI don\\'t think you\\'ll find the \"answer\". It\\'s certainly not food you ate or your toothpaste.  UC is an autoimmune disease that starts at the rectum and continues upward in the colon.  For many it can be inherited, but I think the tendency for autoimmune just needs the right trigger.  Once UC is in place, its pattern is pretty much set.  For some, symptoms can be dealt with quickly, for others they cannot.  There\\'s a variety of medications...again..for some they work, others not.\\n\\nThere is some research lately regarding the bacteriology of our digestive tracts.\\n\\nWhere exactly in the colon is your UC? limited or throughout?\\n\\nWhat medications are you on?\\n\\nRegarding your wife\\'s symptoms, it would be wise for her to have a colonoscopy for a definitive diagnosis.  There are some things that can mimic UC...\\n\\nquincy\\njust bumping this up to see if it\\'ll show there are replies on the thread list.\\nq\\nI was diagnosed with UC a year ago.  Sympotoms presented some time before I was able to get a diagnosis.  When I finally did the dx it spread to my entire colon.  several weeks in the hospital, medications, blood transfusion and left being unable to eat alot of my favourite foods.  Why this happended I don\\'t know.  Still continuing with medications.\\nWish you well with your battle and don\\'t give up,  Stay on top with your Dr.\\nGood Luck',\n",

If yes, methods, tactics, strategy ?\\n2) if i feel well and do not taking tablets, how fast a flare up may start ? How long it develop ?\\n3) how physical activities (gym, running, swimming and so on) affect on people with UC?\\n4) can supercooling of body start flare up ?\\n\\nThank you\\nI noticed that supercooling is not good for me, after it blood or mucus may appear. Hunger has a bad influence. Sport activities (gym) have good influence\\n\\nSuch foods have good influence to decrease flare up\\n1) honey with hot tea, effects after 1-2 weeks\\n2) sea buckthorn oil 3 times per day before eating\\n3) tutsan (St. John\\'s wort broth)\\n4) yogurt with bifidobacteria (LGG)\\nayyyy ..where are you ?\\nI guess none of us has the experience as you\\'re wanting.  I was diagnosed with UC over 21 years ago and treat with 5ASA oral and rectal meds.  The Salofalk retention enema, I taper to maintenance....the Asacol oral 6 pills a day is a constant.\\n\\nNot using meds is your choice....I personally like the fact that mine hasn\\'t spread, and all my c-scope results has been precancer free.\\n\\nI\\'ve never been on any systemic meds for it, including pred or any immuno meds.\\n\\nI don\\'t plan on it, either.\\n\\nJust to add UC is an autoimmune disease.  For many, extreme fitness routines can exacerbate symptoms.  Doesn\\'t mean that once it\\'s under control it will....balance is a good thing.\\n\\nq\\nThaks. And how can i gain the weight of my body ?\\nbut if i do sport activities i feel better. Stool 0-2 times in day.\\nEat!  and often.\\n\\nBest to have actual foods that your body can use rather than products with low carbs, artificial sweeteners, etc.\\n\\nWhatever foods cause you discomfort, choose when to eat them or don\\'t eat them at all.\\n\\nIt took me years to gain the weight I lost during my years if diarrhea before I was diagnosed....and I ate a lot.\\n\\nIf you feel better...is it emotionally or physically.  The point of gaining weight is to take in more than you burn....which you can afford to do, it seems.\\n\\nBy the way, exercise won\\'t keep your UC from flaring.....and with many, they don\\'t recognise symptoms or choose to ignore them until they\\'re in a full-blown flare to the point where it\\'s spread throughout their colon.\\n\\nGet really smart about UC, treatments and that the fact that it\\'s life-long.  Don\\'t forget that there are other disorders or invaders that can mimic UC...it\\'s best to make sure you have a difinitive diagnosis.\\n\\nRegarding stool 2x daily...is it with urgency?  Do you have rectal discomfort upon bms?  do you have lots of mucus?\\nIf you have periods of constipation...that, in itself, can be a symptom of low in the rectum inflammation.\\n\\nquincy\\nI feel better emotionally and physically. For example, after i started the gym my bowel movement become more solid and dense. The color of feces is dark brown. Next day after gym i can have bowel movements in the evening 1 time without mucus and blood or 0 times. But usually i have BM 1 or 2 times in the morning. I can have 3 days without mucus and blood, but next 2 or 3 days small amount of mucus and blood appear again. After that again 3 days no mucus and blood ... I take 3 grams of Salazapyrin. I get up at 8.30 and take 1 gram at 9.00. After that i take  1 gram at 14.00 and again the last one at 21.00 o`clock. I use Asacol rectal 500 mg on the night.\\nFor me eating a lot is no good thing, because if i have no blood and mucus in the stool in the morning, after i eat a lot in the dinner it can appear after 2-4 hours of overeating. I try eat less but 3-4 times a day. I do not have constipation, because if i have no BM 1 day, it does not mean that i have constipation. 09/11/2009 before i visited the doctor i have 3 days with out mucus and blood, and i did not take any med. The firts colonoscopy was 19/11/2009 and doctor said that it is proctosigmoiditis. After that the other doctor did colonoscopy 29/12/2009 and said that a few red marks in rectum. And said it is proctit. The distance was 10 cm from anal. 01/07/2010 i will have another colonoscopy. Will see how salazapyrin and asacol work together.\\n\\nYou said that \"By the way, exercise won\\'t keep your UC from flaring\"\\nI think that each people is individual. My doctor said that i should take pills 2-3 years and if i have good result i can try to stop med. She said that some people do not take pills and they do not have flares. She said that she has some patients that 5 years do not take pills and 5 years in remission without taking any med.\\n\\nTomorrow i want to start taking the Salofalk and watch the result. It is need 1 or 2 weeks that see the result, but it is for me. Some people need 1 months or 2 to see the result. 1 week ago i did my blood test, and doctor said that i have good results.\\nI have small amount of gases when i have BM.\\nI do not feel any pain in my muscles, i do have milk acid in muscles, after gym i am not tired, i do not feel that my muscles grow up ... it is very strange ... but gym helps me ... all my life I did sport activities (from childhood), basketball, swimming, break-dance, gym (body-building), i always lifted my weight and felt tired and felt pain in my muscles, muscles growed up ... when UC started in september of 2009 i visited the gym, and i had no problem with weight lifting, i had stool 2-3 times in the morning with mucus...small amount of blood, i started to think that it is gym, and it is the reason of mucus and blood. I decreased 4 times visiting gym to 2 times at week. I started feel worse, 15/10/2009 i completely gave up gym, and it became worse. But i felt that my muscles can grow up, i felt pain... after 5 mounts i started again gym... i can say that i cannot feel anything in my muscles ... some expansion in muscles during the training, but after training i feel like i did no visit the gym at all... i called the doctor and told her that salazapyrin and rectal med block some process in my blood or i do not know ... she told that she do not know anything ...\\nI eat boiled eggs, boiled chicken, curd, yogurt with LGG, boiled rise, boiled potato, a limited mount of fresh beets, tomatoes, cucumbers, pears and bananas. Soups and porridge I eat too. Boiled carrots and cabbage, I noticed that Nestea Lemon and chocolate \"Bounty\" are very good for me ... do not know why ...\\nIncreasing physical load in gym, side effects from Salazapyrin such as headache and dizziness gone away...\\nNext week i want try probiotic VSL 3 ... i will keep you informed ...\\nSounds like you have it figured out....but in truth, your rectal meds are NOT enough.  You should also be on a higher amount such as a retention enema....I don\\'t know what\\'s available there, but you could ask your pharmacy as to UC rectal medications they can get...then ask your doctor.\\n\\nI didn\\'t say eat large meals, I said eat a lot more food, over and above what you burn off in a day.\\n\\nIf you burn off the carbs, so I understand, you won\\'t burn off the protein?  is that true?\\n\\nKeep reading about UC.....medications and how to treat.\\n\\nI will totally advise you to NOT go off your medication.  Use a lower amount for maintenance.\\n\\nAdd fibre supplements to bulk/fluff/soften the stool....it\\'s also good for bowel exercise..lol.\\n\\nVSL#3..I haven\\'t tried it, but many I am in contact with do....start with a lower amount like one package daily..then increase as per instructions.\\n\\nBe well,\\nquincy\\n\\nWhat does it mean ?',\n",

       " {'post': \"Okay so I have been having chronic bouts of runny, bloody stools for the past 5 months and ended up becoming very weak, light headed, pale and lethargic over the past 2 weeks to the point where I couldnt even walk a few steps without feeling I had run a mile.\\n\\nAnyways, I was admitted into the hospital because I had a very low hemoglobin count. The doctor said I was sitting at 44 and the normal range is 116. He explained to me how dangerous my levels were and that I would need to have a blood transfusion. So I spent the night having that done and 4 bags of blood later, feeling much better with my color back, I get a colonoscopy and a scope down my throat (to look at my stomach). Turns out I have Colitis and I am so glad to know now what the cause is. I am only 24, and want to keep healthy. I have found this messageboard very helpful in the past and was wondering if anyone has any good advice.\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\nAshley\\nHi...colitis or ulcerative colitis?  Did the docs do stool samples to make sure nothing else was happening such as c.difficile?\\n\\nWhat meds are you on at this point?\\n\\nIt's good you went to the hospital...sounds as though you were in quite a precarious state.  Were you not under a GI's care before getting to this point?\\n\\nHope each day you feel better.\\n\\nq\\nHey, Thanks for your response\\nI was seeing a G.I doctor about a year ago because of blood in the stool. He did a colonoscopy and found nothing. He gave me astool softener (at the time I was constipated) and let me be on my way. Everything seemed ok but about 3 months later I started getting extremely bloody loose, stools and I let this go on for a while. I lost a lot of blood, over a long period of time. So they did the tests, urine, blood, no fecal but said when he did my colonoscopy and endoscopy he saw my colon was inflamed and now im taking iron supplementation and mesalamine for the inflammation\\n\\nI'm really so sorry to hear what you have been through, and still going through but at least you did get an answer.\\n\\nI think the only thing you can do at this point is follow your Drs. orders and also ask if there are any foods you should stay away from and any you should be getting more of.\\n\\nI really feel for you as I went almost 2 years with chronic Diarrhea and had every test there is but they found nothing. Have no food allergies etc. so all they suggested was to take a Probiotic to see if it would help, as the meds. they tried on me just made me too sleepy and out of it. So far..so good. Yes I get a few flares every so often but for the most part, I'm feeling much better. Terrible to lose so much time out of your life with Drs. and meds. with no answers. Keep us posted how your doing and if any diet changes were made how it helped.\\n\\nAll the best...JJ....\\n\\nThank you JJ so much for your response\\nIt is really tough and its confusing sometimes, knowing that there isn't an actually cure and that a flare up can happen at any time. I find that eating a lot of fruits and veggies helps and greasy foods make it a bit worse, mainly because they tend to pass through me so quickly. Like, I will literally eat something like chicken pad Thai and go within an hour. Its weird. I just hope that it gets to a point where I no longer notice the bloody stools - I hate seeing that and I have been on my meds for about a month (no steroids .... as of yet!) but I havent noticed a whole lot of positive changes. The Dr. says it takes time, so I guess all I can do it wait.\\n\\nAt least I know im not alone in all this and itll all just make me stronger\\n\\n\\nThanks again hun\\n\\nYour more then welcome. I really do feel for you as I know how frustrating and just down and out one can feel. Going through my bout I was getting ever so depressed as it seemed everytime something would come up..I many times missed it....\\n\\nLike you said, all you can do is what they ask you to and take any meds. that will help. Lordy for awhile there I felt like a pill machine and nothing really helped but sure did keep me sleepy a lot. After I started the Probiotics I actually got my life back. Oh yes, I have flares, just had one over the Easter holiday..not the Easter day celebration I wanted.\\n\\nYes I had the eat something and then wait about a half hr. and off to the races. Take care sweets and I really hope you feel better.\\n\\nKeep me posted, and all the best...JJ....\\n\\nAw, thank you so much\\nIts so nice to know that there's people who understand and going through this as well. A lot of people don't understand the severity of it and it truly does affect quality of life. Aw that must have been terrible\\nBut I hope you still enjoyed the day and allowed yourself to cheat a little\\n\\n\\nI know!! I feel like a pill machine right now!! I am going through another flare and I have a cold at the same time so I cant even count all the pills I am taking. It sucks and I miss the days when taking medication was only when you were sick with a cold. Now it seems it is so much more serious\\n\\n\\nThanks again!!\\nTake care too <3\\nWell that is why I like this board so much..people here have problems even worse then me yet they never hesitate to try and help!!!\\n\\nNo my Easter didn't turn out well at all, even hubby wasn't feeling too swift. Oh well, thank goodness we didn't have a lot of company coming so we just made due. Oh yes...where are those days of maybe an aspirin if you had a headache, or a bit of Immodium if the tummy was upset? Isn't getting older just WONDERFUL???\\nOh well, like they say, it could be worse.\\n\\nPoor hubby takes so many meds. we need a special cabinet just for his. He really has been through a lot the last few years. Like we say..we can't let it get us down, just do the best we can and hope for the best.\\n\\nTake care and all my best wishes...JJ...\\n\",\n",

       " {'post': \"I am a 38yr old female. About 12yrs ago had my gall bladder removed and ever since then I have suffered with daily diarrhea. I didn't work a job so basically life revolved around timing eating to when I would be home. I did finally get a colonoscopy back in 2006 and was diagnosed with UC. Weird thing though, UC starts in the rectum and works its way up, I am opposite.My transverse colon has the worst inflammation with very little towards the rectum. I started working last yr and have been very sick. I absolutely can not eat except very little in the evening because everything goes straight through me and I would not be able to work running to the bathroom. For the first time since the diarrhea started, I have lost 20lbs, become quite anemic, and pretty weak. I did have another colonoscopy last oct. which was pretty much the same as the first. I don't get fever and chills, just can't handle food. I even tried just juicing and that would go straight through. Now two months ago I developed SEVERE rectal pain. I have been living in hell with pain, I have had to run out of work crying. I am having much less(almost none)frank blood than before, but dr said hemrrhoids. Well I have had hemrrhoids for yrs with no pain, this pain in only on the left and radiates through the cheek, down the leg and through the vaginal wall. When I get the sever bouts of pain it drains me down to nothing and of course I am terrified to eat because going to the bathroom (about 1/2hr later) sets it off and it lasts hours. I finally got so desperate I am on prednisone for the first time. I am going for a sigmoidoscopy in a few weeks. Has anyone else had pain like this with UC?\\nHi,\\nI have. I was diagnosed with UC in May/June2010 and with it was horrific pain. I have been hospitalized twice now for the UC and pain. It perplexes the doctors because normally UC patients don't have this type of pain and hardly are on any narcotics. I don't know what to tell you, but I feel for you. I completely can empathize with you on how much it can hurt.\\n\\nI'm currently having a flare. Spent 2 weeks in the hospital and now 2 weeks at home and in bed. I have now been on some strong pain medication for the past month. The only thing some of my GI doctors are thinking is that there might be a secondary problem.\\n\\nBest of luck to you. I hope they can find something to help you and what's wrong...\",\n",

I was shocked since I expected to be told I had internal hemrroids. I was hoping the biopsy would come back fine since I had been on cipro and had taken a lot of ibuprophen the last few weeks for back pain. Nope it is the real thing.  I read online that the link between ibuprophen and worsening UC symptoms may not be as strong as they once believed. I wonder if that is true since I had symptoms for several months with ibuprophen as my painkiller of choice. I have not taken motrin in a few weeks and I do not notice any change besides what the Rowasa helps with. I tried going off of the enema's to see if  I was any better.

I've had a ton of tests including a barium enema CT and a full abdominal CT with contrast, they said both of those look fine.\\nThe doctor is getting a Barium Xray to see if i have crohn's, from what i've read crohn's is inflammation, and if there was inflammation in that area wouldn't it have already shown up?\\nThanks\\n\\nI think you should push for a colonoscopy before the barium enema.   I don't know how it would show CD, but for my UC and 15 inches of severe inflammation...it showed nothing at all.\\n\\nq\\nok thanks. I think the reason they did barium enema and all that stuff is because they've thought it was my appendix but it appears just fine on all these tests and the doctor doesnt want to do exploratory laproscopy because he said there would only be about a 10% chance he'd find anything. Now he thinks it could be crohn's so im having a Upper GI with small bowel follow through on wednesday. Now i get to drink the barium, woohoo.\\nHe did say that it may come down to getting a colonoscopy, but he also said that he wants to avoid that if possible....\\nWhy would you want to avoid a colonoscopy? They are completely safe and routine. I have had two. You do get a little nervous until they give you the fentanyl then you could'nt care less what they do to you. They are by far the best way to see what's going on. Really nothing to worry about.... if you're nervous.\\nYes, I would agree to have the c-scope before all the other testing...Crohn's happens anywhere from mouth to anus...and the ONLY way to see what's going on in the colon is to take a look.\\n\\nI've had 8 done...no biggie.  I watch the monitor in a nice mellow state from the meds.\\n\\nKeep us posted on the outcome.\\nq\\nhi everyone thanks.\\nReally i think the reason they've done everything else, all those CT's and all is because they've thought it's my appendix but on all the CT's the appendix was fine.\\nAnd the reason the doctor wants to avoid a colonoscopy, is im 14 years old.... i failed to mention that lol.. But froom what i've heard it's no biggie. They've already scheduled me fro my upper gi with small bowel follow through on wednesday... so we'll see how that goes lol then the doctor i guess will decide whether to do the colonoscopy.\\nI'll keep everyone posted\\n\\nSeriously, it's no big deal. I remember how nervous i was the first time I had it done and afterward feeling a little silly. BY FAR the worst part is the prep and even that was not so terrible.\\nok thanks so much. It will most likely come down to that and i have been petrified at the thought of it... knowing me the sedatives would knock me out anyway.\\nI had the upper GI with SBFT today. It took like 3 hours and the barium tasted terrible!! We should get the results within the next couple days...im so anxious to find out if it showed anything!\\nUPDATE\\nthey called this morning. The tests all came back normal. The general surgeon decided based on my symptoms to test my gallbladder next week. I dont have much problems with diarrhea although i have alot of the symptoms of crohn's... such as lesions on my legs, dizziness, and abdominal pain, etc... Who knows. Either way the gall bladder test isnt until NEXT week. And im in severe pain :/\\nupdate- i had the gallbladder test wednesday.

       " {'post': \"Hi, i'm new here and look forward to some insight from patients for a change rather than just my doctor. I have been on Prednisone for a little over a year now for Crohn's. I started at 60mg, went into remission very quickly and got to 20mg pretty easily. It took a couple of months to get from there to where I am now.... right around 10mg. The side effects are becoming such that I would honestly rather just deal with a Crohn's flare for a bit while I give my body and mind a break from the prednisone. So my question is if anybody can offer any advice/experience for the fastest, SAFEST way to get to zero?? I've been bouncing between as low as 7mg and as high as 12mg for about three months now. Other factors to consider are that I am coming up on my fourth infusion of Remicade in a few days which I also take for Ankylosing Spondylitis. The remicade may be helping the Crohn's (hard to tell while still on prednisone), but neither is helping the A.S.\\nThanks!!\\nAlso wanted to add..... I had been on Norco for a year due to A.S. pain and my doctor decided he was no longer comfortable with that anymore. He now wants me to use 600-800 mg Ibuprofen every 6 hrs for pain. ??? I was always under the impression that NSAIDS were to be avoided with IBD.?? Any thoughts? The Norco was wonderfull for my A.S. AND my Crohn's as it slowed everything down. Most people get constipated, I got normal. But, i'm not allowed to feel good anymore so I need other options.\\nI know no one has responded, but for anyone reading this post that might be interested here is an update....\\nI am down to 5 mg prednisone and doing VERY well. I have been coming down .5 mg every four days. Perhaps the Remicade is starting to work??? it's been 2 week since my fourth infusion. Also spoke with my doc about my concerns with the ibuprofen and he agreed. I am back on Norco fo A.S. pain but this time he is only giving me a weeks worth at a time to help avoid the temtation to abuse the narcotics. This seems to be a good plan as I am now using about half of what i was before he cut me off. At first I was upset with my doc for taking away my pain relief, but now i realize how fortunate i am to have a doctor who is actually concerned about my long term well being.\\nRemicade and Asacol are the only things that worked for my Crohn's. I just came out of the hospital because a doctor just kept me on prednisone. I was on a three month taper and it screwed me up. I eventually just quit taking it when I was at the lowest dose. hope this helps.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'My stools for two weeks were just blood and liquid with the occasional small solids, so I had a colonoscopy and an endoscopy today. The doctor told me I have ulcerative colitis and that I could go back to the hospital next week to get medicine. He said they need a week to take a look at the results.\\n\\nSo that means another week of having these irritating, frequent bowel movements that produce nothing.\\n\\nWhat can I do in the meantime to make myself more comfortable?\\n\\nAlso, I read the following here: http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/colitis/\\n\"About 25 to 40 percent of ulcerative colitis patients must eventually have their colons removed because of massive bleeding, severe illness, rupture of the colon, or risk of cancer.\"\\n\\nTwo or three years ago, I had a colonoscopy/endoscopy for a similar bowel issue, but I don\\'t remember my diagnosis. I do remember that I had to take at least one medication though. I remember having to put a jolly rancher-sized suppository into my anus every night before I went to bed.\\n\\nI\\'m 24, and I\\'m worried about the idea of having my colon removed. At the link above, it lists two methods: ileostomy and ileoanal anastomosis. Both methods sound extremely uncomfortable/inconvenient.\\n\\nWhat can I do diet-wise, lifestyle-wise, and exercise-wise to prevent future outbreaks of ulcerative colitis or possibly the removal of my colon? I drink about 20 beers a month. I smoke about 3 cigarettes a week. I run three miles five days a week and lift weights three days a week. I eat an egg, rice, and seaweed for breakfast. At lunch I have traditional Korean food (because I\\'m living in Korea for a year from 9/2009-9/2010) which is usually rice, soup, kimchi (fermented vegetables), and assorted meats and seafood. For dinner, I usually have rice again, but my dinner food really varies. I just discovered the pasta section at the grocery store at the same time my bowel issue started, so for two weeks I\\'ve been having various pastas for dinner.\\n\\nI understand beer and cigarettes are unhealthy in many ways (liver, lungs, throat, stomach, etc.) but how much do they contribute to bowel issues?\\n\\nColon problems run in my family. My parents have polyps removed every year, and my uncle died from colon cancer. I think my ulcerative colitis stems from two sources: hereditary and not getting enough fiber in my diet. With the exception of oranges, I\\'ve been getting virtually no fiber. I think I\\'ll start eating a bowl of high fiber cereal every morning for breakfast. Is this advisable?\\nHello there.  I am 27 now and was diagnosed this year (was 26 at the time).  I had very similar symptoms as you - blood and mucus with the occasional solids.  A colonoscopy revealed very mild ulcerative colitis (if mine is mild, I\\'d hate to see what severe is).  Anyways, I was put on rectal enemas nightly (Rowasa) and 1.2GM of Lialda (which I still take to this day).  The Rowasa I discontinued after about 2 months, and it put me in remission until recently.  Now my symptoms are returning after a bought with a stomach illnees in mid-November; my next GI appointment isn\\'t until December 23rd, however.\\n\\nMy doctor told me diet has little to do with flare-ups, but eating fruits and vegetables can help.  Staying away from caffeine is also a good idea, as is limiting alcohol use.  Cigarette (tobacco) has been shown to actually reduce IBD sufferers\\' symptoms but it is not recommended as a use of treatment due to its life threatening side effects.\\n\\nI also worry about one day having surgery to have my colon remove, but the only relief I get from having this disease is knowing it CAN be cured by surgery and that surgery for IBD is getting to a point where you aren\\'t hindered from daily activities (research J-pouch surgery).  40% of people with UC will have to have surgery, and most includes the removal of the entire colon.\\n\\nI also exercise and eat well (I\\'m a weightlifter).  It helps when I\\'m doing it.  It seems like my UC flares during this time of the year.  Most likely you\\'ll be put on oral meds with some rectal meds to directly treat the inflammation and stop the bleeding.  The rectal meds work wonders, believe me; they\\'re just very expensive if you don\\'t have insurance (and sometimes WITH insurance).\\n\\nExpect a colonoscopy every 2-3 years, especially when you have a direct link to colorectal cancer in your family.  My father has colitis, too, but has only had 2 flares in his entire life and he\\'s 65 now.  He has never been on treatment for it, and I have no colorectal cancer episodes in my bloodline.\\n\\nGood luck.  If you\\'d like to discuss this further, don\\'t hesitate to PM me since I\\'m still fairly new to all this, too.',\n",

       " {'post': 'Ok so here\\'s my story so far..\\n\\nIt was around christmas time last year (2008) i started to get really run down and tired, putting it down to general winter colds and flu i just got on with it constantly taking flu capsules ibruphen etc everything you could think of, until i felt so tired n run down i started missing sixth form and work.\\nI then made several trips back and for to the doctors, in was then in February I came back with a positive glandular fever test. I felt relieved to begin with that i finally knew i wasnt going mad and i really was unwell.\\nBut this carried on and on for months, with frequent emergency doctors appointments for them to just tell me constantly that what i was feeling was all down the the glandular fever, but i knew there was something else going on.\\nI was constantly being sick and losing so much weight. It was only when i spoke to a nurse who then spoke to a different doctor, and i was finally referred to a consultant.\\nBut by that point it was too late, it is now june and my mum being as worried at she was rushed me to A&E after seeing the weight just drop off in a matter of days - this was before the appointment for the consultant even came through, i was admitted for 10 days - the 10 days when all my alevel exams were lol.\\ni had various tests, daily bloods and a sigmoidoscopy which confirmed some type of crohns or collitous.\\nIm being treated for crohns disease, but they think that it is very ulcerated, i saw some pictures, they werent nice.\\nBut ive been taking numerous medications since then. asacol, prednisolone, calcium, antibiotics (now stopped) & iron supplements.\\nI have tried weaning off the steroids, but i get down to 15mg (which i am currently on) i start to get abdominal pains again. They feel like a bad uncomfortable type of butterflies, any lower than 15mg and im in quite alot of discomfort and alot of other symptoms also start to reappear.\\nMy consultant has now suggested trying another drug azathioprine, obviously after checking my white blood cell count. But I am very concerned about taking this drug?\\nIm currently very tired all the time again, and i also seem to be picking up alot of infections as it is, my bowel movements are more irregular than regular. i have heard alot of negative feedback about this drug and i am concerned about the risks of taking it, aswell as not taking it.\\n\\nTo be perfectly honest im just fed up of feeling unwell and taking untolds of medication.\\nWho else has gone through this is going through this can give me any advice or just tell me their story because all i seem to be doing lately is worrying about this new drug, the fears of surgery and future re-investigations.\\nThanks.\\nBlimey you need to take some natural remedies and get away from all that chemical stuff. Ibuprofen could have triggered it as it\\'s gut rot in a packet. Avoid.\\n\\nI suggest that you read Mary Enig and the benefits of taking coconut oil. Have a read to start with but the book you want to get hold of is specifically the benefits of coconut oil in relation to bowel disorders and crohnes as well. It\\'s called \\'Eat fat, lose fat\\'. One of the unusual things about coconut oil is that it doesn\\'t need bile to digest it so it goes straight into your system as energy. That\\'s why athletes use it and it should help you stop feeling tired all the time.\\n\\nGood luck and please let us know how you get on.\\nYes I realised how bad ibuprofen was afterwards lol - i dont take it anymore.\\n\\nand thank you very much i will look into that - i also read something last night about coconut macaroons? or is this just garbage?\\nI will try and order that book into the library and have a read up.\\n\\nGot my blood tests for this new drug wednesday. I\\'ll have a read and speak to the doctor and let you know how it goes.\\n\\nThanks again.\\nI love coconut macaroons but I wouldn\\'t take them for health reasons. LOL.\\n\\nCoconut oil, yes. You can buy it in jars at health food shops and it\\'s a set fat like butter but is easy to make runny by popping it into a microwave for about twenty seconds. I used to pour it over my breakfast cereal with warm milk to keep it runny otherwise it will set again as soon as it gets into contact with anything cold and then it\\'s a bit greasy but still delicious. You can spread it like butter if it\\'s warm and that would be nice and tasty on bread instead of butter. Mary Enig gives you loads of recipes in her book which you should find an interesting adventure.\\nMost bowel disorders are self inflicted including crohnes. What you have to do is find the right conditions for your body to heal itself because that is what it tries to do....you can\\'t stop that process but you can stop it from starting if you get my drift. The only time the body gives up on the healing process is when it gives up completely and you die. Just keep telling yourself that......and try to find the right conditions for that healing process to start.\\nCoconut oil could just be the catalyst for that to happen. Enjoy the book. I think she\\'s a genius. All her recommendations are backed up by sound research, she\\'s not a quack.\\nRead everything you can about the disease.  There have been many advances in medicine regarding treatment for Crohn\\'s that will hopefully help save your bowel.  The collitis is the worst part of the disease and you really need to get it under control as you can.  Luckily it has flare ups vs constant but the flare up is really horrifying.  I will pray for you.  Find the best gastroenterologist you can that specializes in the disease.  Natural products may work for you, who knows?  But you need to have the specialist handy in the event it does not.  The longer you delay treatment, the more progressed the disease will become resulting in losing portions of your bowels.\\n\\nGood luck to you!\\nI am a 43 yr old mother of 2 and I was diagnosed with crohns 6/92. I have had 2 bowel resections and am currently on HUmira 2 times per mo. I finally am having normal bowel movements and can eat almost anything I want with very little to no abdominal pain. If my crohn\\'s starts acting up again I will insist on surgery as soon as posable. I was very afraid of surgery at 1st but, after everything I went through (bowel obstructions, gross amounts of prednisone,every type of medication you can name,anemia pain ect and the inability to have a 3rd child due to all the meds) I wouldn\\'t fear surgery. Hang in there and check into Humira or Remicade (it worked but not as well)The most important thing is to find a good MD that will listen to you and take your concernss seriously. Good luck to you.\\nThank you all for your advice.\\nI am now taking azathioprine. n have been for about a month now. side effects havent been great but not too bad either, still unsure about the whole hair loss situation haha, my hair comes out rapidly all the time now, but i still have a full head of hair. lol its probably just be stressing that causes that anyway.\\nsome days i feel fine and others are a nightmare.\\nmy consultant has trold me to stay on the same meds till after xmas now\\nim less anxious about it all now, but i do have a few problems sleeping and staying awake during the day, even if ive managed a 12 hour sleep. i have tried everything frm old wives tales to herbal remedies.\\n\\nmy life is one big routine of tablets doctors and hospitals. i dont know how people with worse problems havent gone stir crazy.\\n\\nbut again thanks for all your help and advice.\\n\\nI sure am glad that you \"let it out\" so to speak.  That is one thing this is so good for.  I know how embarrassing it was, but alot of info just came to you--I wish you all the best and do not hesitate to check the alternative medicines out--just don\\'t put it all off and do find that gastroenterologist.',\n",

       " {'post': 'I won\\'t bore you with my long drawn out story about all the things that my messed up body has put me through, but, suffices to say that I\\'ve had diarrhea off and on (mostly on) for about 15 years.  (I know, I know....don\\'t say it.)  Then it likes to alternate with no BM\\'s for a few days, as if my intestines are \"all cleared out\" and then I\\'ll have one very hard BM and the diarrhea starts all over again.  I have developed difficulty swallowing.  I have joint pain and have severe lumbar spinal arthritis (DX at age 30).  I get these weird mouth sore things.  I\\'m super fatigued all the time.  They found that my B-12 level was low about 2 years ago, so I give myself injections and they were sure that this was going to make me \"all better\".  It did help, as having super low B-12 is life threatening.  I had been in and out of the hospital several times up to that point with fainting spells, dehydration, low oxygen levels, etc.  I\\'ve ran unexplained fevers for weeks on end.  I get the chills just out of nowhere.  I know where every bathroom is any place I go, because when I gotta go, I gotta GO!!!!\\n\\nI\\'ve been worked up for everything under the sun and treated for a ton of things that I ended up not even having.  However, I\\'ve never really addressed the whole idea that the GI tract could be my culprit.  I\\'m having a colonosocpy just to \"see\" why my intestines are so unhappy.\\n\\nHOWEVER-----I should weigh about 50 lbs for how much I poop, yet, I\\'m technically obese.  I was part of the \"genome project\" when they thought that I had Parkinson\\'s Disease (long story) and found out that I carry every mutated gene for Crohn\\'s Disease and that my risk of getting it was like 27%.  Very high compared to the average person.  I also carry every obesity gene in spades.  My whole family is heavy.  My question remains....can I be a fatty AND have Crohn\\'s?\\n\\nRebecca\\nHi Becca, I have not heard the theory that if a person is overweight they can\\'t get Crohn\\'s Disease.  Crohn\\'s is an autoimmune disease and as far as I know anyone can be a candidate for getting an autoimmune disease, although some people may be more at risk genetically. But genetic inheritance is not the whole story and it is likely to be an interaction between genes and environment that causes a person to develop Crohn\\'s or another autoimmune disease.\\n\\nThe chills you mention that you get out of nowhere --- I get those too, they are horrible aren\\'t they?!   I have Crohn\\'s in the small bowel, and with me the chills are caused by the inflammation.\\n\\nThe colonoscopy will be useful. But you may want to think about having some small bowel investigations such as a barium small bowel follow through xray, or a small bowel enema with xray. These are the main two initial diagnostic tests for small bowel diseases.\\nThank you for your reply and for the information.\\n\\nAutoimmune diseases of all sorts run in my family, unfortunately.  Plus, having had the genetic test come back showing me as having ever single possible mutated gene FOR Crohn\\'s PLUS all the symptoms I\\'ve been living with for years, it seemed like it was time to get the test done.\\n\\nWe\\'ll see how it goes I guess?\\n\\nThanks again, for replying!!\\n\\nBec\\nBecca - we have similar health histories.  I was recently diagnosed with Celiac disease.  You may want to consider testing for that as it can cause many of the symptoms you have, plus they are now finding that a large portion of the obese population has this disease.  Along with the diarrhea, fatigue and nutritional deficiencies, Celiac disease can make you absolutely nonstop hungry!  Your body is not getting the nutrients it needs, thus you always feel hunger.  You have symptoms that, in my mind, are almost yelling that you have Celiac.  The joint pain, constant diarrhea, needing B12 shots - please go get tested and see if this is what you have!  Going gluten-free may enable you to completely change your lifestyle!  I know - I had very similar symptoms and was overweight.  Hope this helps!\\nHow do I get tested for it?  Is it a blood test?  I need it to be something really simple.  People are starting to think I\\'m crazy, with all these tests and procedures, etc.\\n\\nBec\\nYes, you CAN have Crohn\\'s if you are obese... it\\'s an autoimmune disorder. I am living proof... I was diagnosed with Crohn\\'s (which has been reconfirmed several times since) over 10 years ago, and I am obese. Although, I did lose 90 pounds when I was very sick (throwing up everything, etc.), and later gain it back (sadly), and have lost some at times in my life that I was VERY sick. Good luck w/the doctor appointment. I was mis-diagnosed with other things (and even had one dr. tell me I was bulemic... UM, NO, I\\'m not...) for two years prior...\\nYes, you can absolutely have crohn\\'s disease if you are obese. Trust me, I know... and I was diagnosed over 10 years ago (which has been reconfirmed several times.) Although there have been times I lost large amounts of weight when I was very very sick (and gained it back later, boo!)\\ni\\'ve heard that celiac is kinda hard to diagnose. i\\'ve actually wondered for awhile now if i have celiac or crohn\\'s.\\n\\nPeople who have celiac disease cannot tolerate gluten, a protein in wheat, rye, and barley, so try reading ingredient labels and cutting those things out for a couple weeks and see if anything improves.\\n\\nI know that General Mills makes a bunch of varieties of Chex cereal that are gluten free and they now say it really big on the front of the boxes.\\n\\nI\\'ve thought I was lactose intolerant for awhile now too, so I cut out cow\\'s milk and started drinking soy milk. Well that still didn\\'t seem to help, so I cut out the soy milk too and started drinking this rice milk called Rice Dream.\\n\\nso far it seems to really be helping my diarrhea, so you might try a combination of rice or corn chex with rice milk.\\n\\never since having my son i\\'ve had mixed IBS. some days i\\'ll be constipated, other days i\\'ll have diarrhea. i used to only get diarrhea. i\\'ve dealt with this since i started puberty.\\n\\nit also seems to help if i eat a medum sized green apple once a day. for some people though, it might not be a good idea. apples are strange, they can constipate you or give you diarrhea or just make you regular.\\n\\ni will also drink metamucil every so often. i tried drinking it every day for awhile there and it really helped the first week i tried it, but then i dont know what happened but it bound me up real bad. maybe i was getting fiber somewhere else in my diet and wasn\\'t drinking enough water. who knows.\\n\\ni am in the process of getting my thyroid checked out. just waiting to hear the results. my mom had hyperthyroidism then later had to get her gallbladder out.\\n\\ni\\'m thinking i would have hypothyroidism if i had it at all though because i\\'m a little overweight.\\n\\ni know i sound like a hypochondriac here, lol, but autoimmune diseases run in my family.\\nThere\\'s a lot more to Crohn\\'s besides just diarrhea... although that\\'s often how it starts. Crohn\\'s eventually will likely get a lot worse... for example, I was throwing up everything, which got worse over 2 years... but eventually ended up in the emergency room with an abscessed fistula (over the years since had 5-6) and had to have emergency surgery, which eventually led to tests to get it properly diagnosed. Now, not so much my stomach as it is my guts, and it\\'s more complicated than just diarrhea, although you may not recognize other symptoms if you do have it.\\n\\nMy old roommate had Celiac disease... if she did not eat gluten, she had ZERO symptoms, but if she ate a brownie or something with gluten, she\\'d have it bad shortly thereafter. I think there is a blood test they can do for it, but I\\'m not sure (kinda like an allergy test and they see if there\\'s a reaction.)\\n\\nThere are typically \"markers\" in a blood test which can indicate a potential auto-immune disease (like crohn\\'s)... for example, extremely high platelets, low red and high white (overactive immune system, and anemia)...\\n\\nIf it\\'s bad, you should consider a colonoscopy... the \"prep\" is the worst part (drinking a gallon of salty stuff, then diarheah for half a day), but it\\'s manageable... they put you under for the procedure, so you don\\'t remember it. A doctor should be able to tell if you have Crohn\\'s (or at least something more than just IBS)... the tissue looks way differently.\\n\\nI hope that helps... willing to answer questions (if you have any) for either of you gals. I was diagnosed with crohn\\'s 10 years ago (and unfortunately, it\\'s still active and have had several issues with it over the years).\\nI was diagnosed with crohn\\'s just after giving birth to my last son, 21 yrs ago now. I was 25. Since then this incredibly miserable disease has seen me in and out of hospital several times, with doctors waiting for the intestine to blow out!\\n\\nMy kidneys are damanged from the medication and constant dehydration. I have been on such high doses of steroid that an ex bf seeing me at the local chemist didn\\'t even recognise me even while I was speaking directly to him! i go from looking like Twiggy to looking like a Biggest Loser contestant, all in a matter of weeks. The skin on my feet can be so tight with excess fluid from steroid therapy that it actually splits open.\\n\\nI look older than I am. I\\'ve also had 2 peri-anal abscess surgeries. The last of which resulted in a fistula. That pain is something I\\'m still traumatised by, 3 yrs later. I all but refuse to leave my house and haven\\'t seen a major shopping centre in yrs because the fear of having to run for the toilets far out-weighs any shopping-assocciated pleasure. Not once has any dr offered me anti-depressants or other mental therapy.\\n\\n\\nNot once in all this time has my gastro warned me of the future outcomes of this disease. I\\'m now trying to get onto low dose naltrexone.\\n\\nTo anyone with this miserable, bastardly condition,\\n\\n*look after yourself as best you can when it flairs\\n*seek many doctors and opinions\\n*join support groups/share info/research\\n*opt for/combine alternative treatments\\n*get on a good dose of vitamin D\\n*pray for stem cell trials\\n*try worm therapy\\n\\nlovelovelove\\n\\n\\nCeliac is initially diagnosed through a blood test which tests for antiibodies in your blood - thereafter you need to have an endoscopy which takes a small sample of tissue from inside your gut and bowel which will confirm the diagnosis.  Thing is you need to be eating Gluten for this to be a successful test as your guts heal themselves in about 6months to 2 years when you stop eating the Gluten.\\n\\nI have Celiacs and the Gluten free diet has changed my life - even though I didnt really understand that I was ill in the first place.\\n\\nMy friend, however, has Crohns and the docs now think that it was caused by Celiacs - unfortunately she gets so ill when she eats Gluten that they cannot test her properly.',\n",

My bowel was also dialated.  The gynys have no idea what this mass is and so I was referred to a bowel specialist. A rectal examination, ct scan and colonoscopy followed to which ulcers were then discovered all over my large intestine.  They are now pretty sure I havn't got cancer from the mass or in the bowel. They took 10 biopsys from my colon as they thought it was crohns disease, but the biopsys results were inconclusive.  The bowel dr thinks I also have diverticular disease were the bowel dilates, however I think the mass has narrowed the bowel underneath it as they couldn't get the original camera around the bowel during the colonoscopy and had to change it. He has said that if I don't have the op now( bowel resection on sigmoid) then i will need it within the next 10 years and he would rather I have it now while I am younger so that I will have a quicker recovery.\\n\\nThe gyny needs to remove my ovary and Fallopian tube and I might need a full hysterectomy and so all the ops will be carried out at the same time. Has anyone else had a resection due to a mass? How bad can diverticular/ crohns disease get? Can either of them cause adhesions like i have? Can anyone give any advice on whether I should have it done now? I have read so many bad stories on the web re bowel resection and wondered if any of you had good stories to tell? Dr.  has said I will be on a normal diet straight afterwards, but from what I have read it doesn't seem correct. Doc's  have not told me about aftercare. Is it normal to need to rush to the loo afterwards and for how long? I am just wondering when i will be able to return to work as i do a lot of home visits and couldn't have the embarrassment of asking clients to use their toilet!  Sorry for so many questions but I don't seem to be getting any advice from my docs. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Sorry I'd there are any spelling mistakes I am using a keyboard that has predictive text and it drives me loopy!\\nHi Choco, wow before I would have surgery I would want a definite answer about cancer. Pretty sure is not good enough.\\n\\nI have crohns disease and ulcerative colitis. I had to have an emergency small bowel resection 7 yrs ago because of an abscess and complete blockage. Matter of fact they thought it was my appendix and they took them out first only to find they were fine, The dr made a second incision lower and found the problem and took out 12 inches of the small bowel and did a reconnect. Its about a 6 weeks recovery time for sure.\\n\\nI would urge you to get a second opinion before doing the surgery. Yes, you may end up with loose stools after surgery. This could be temporary or permanent. Each person is different. If you have crohns disease even after surgery you should be on maintenance meds because crohns can work and do more damage on a microscopic level. Good luck.\\nHi ditsy, thanks for your response. Doc's have done the blood test for cancer and that came back negative.  However they didn't do any biopsys as they were afraid in case they perforated my bowel.\\n\\nIf the mass keeps growing it will close off my bowel completely so I have no choice really in the surgery, and as they don't know what it is at the mo, I don't really want to leave it in.\\n\\nCan you tell me how your resection went? Were there any complications and how are you now?  Do you feel pretty rough after the surgery or did the pain meds take care of that?\\n\\nThanks for replying it's very much appreciated.\\nHi Choco, I had a complete blockage & abscess of the small bowel like I said before and my surgery was an emergency surgery. They don't want those thing perforating. Same with the diverticulitis. Is your dr proposing laproscopic surgery or an open surgery. Naturally  laproscopic surgery is easier to recuperate from because you don't have the large incision to deal with. Mine was an open surgery and it took about 6 weeks for everything to heal nicely and I had two surgeries back to back.What pain I had was postop pain that was controlled very well in the hospital. I did not really have much pain once I came home. Would I do it again, yes I would.\\n\\nThe key to any surgery, particularly bowel surgery is as soon as the nurses will let you, get up out the bed and walk. Walking does two things, helps wake the bowels up from surgery and get them going again and it helps you get your strength back. Another good trick is when getting up or down out of the bed take a bed pillow and press it lightly against your stomach as you are getting up or down. The light pressure helps you alot when doing this. Your first day you sleep most of the time, the 2nd day is usually the roughest of all and I think its just from the anesthesia used to put you to sleep.\\n\\nSince the drs are worried about the possibility of a blockage developing get your surgery done as soon as you can. You don't want to run the risk of any perforation as they can be fatal, when you perforate your insides fill with the infection and people develope what is called toxic shock syndrome it can be fatal. Its not worth taking the risk.\\n\\nOnce the results come back from the biopsy's done at surgery I am sure your drs will know for sure exactly what all that you have going on. If you have crohns or diverticulitis you will need a good gastroenterologist to take care of you.\\n\\nif you have any more questions or if I can help let me know.\\nHi ditsy, you have been so helpful so thankyou very much for your wise words of wisdom.  Did you have to have a tube down your throat info your stomach on recovery (only it sounds really uncomfortable). Doc's havn't told me what to expect and so I am curious.\\n\\nWere you having any symptoms before you was rushed in and if so, did it get steadily worse over time or were they sudden symptoms?\\n\\nThanks for your help.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I was diagnosed with UC about 4 months ago.  I\\'ve been taking 6 Asacol twice daily and this medication has given me my life back.  I suddely developed diarrhea (no blood or mucous)  over the past 24 hours. I also had a headache for over a day. (I get migraines also)  I guess I\\'m trying to figure out if this is just the flu or is it a flare up of the colitis.  I\\'m really concerned that the pills which I consider to be a life saver, stopped working.  Can anyone with UC tell me about their flare up symptonms?  Maybe I\\'m being overly concerned and just had the flu.  I still had diah today.  Thanksk for replying.\\nI would bet its just a bug going through you.  I can always tell the difference as the diarreah is less painful when I am sick as compared to when I am having colitis issues.  Also colitis for me is usually a bad stool and then I am fine but when I am sick it can be bad for a day or so and then fine.\\nThanks for your response.  I\\'m thinking it was just a bug as you mentioned as the stool from colitis is as you said a \"bad stool\".  The GI told me I could eat what I normally do except for greasy/fatty foods. It could have been from what I ate also. I\\'ve read on the message boards of so many others who have had Asacol stop working and that was my main concern.  Thanks again.',\n",

Anyway here goes.\\n\\nThis all started about 5 years ago. I was feeding my rabbit, I stood up and I got an intense pain in my abdomen, I waddled upstairs then just collapsed onto my bed in agony. It went off, then I got a similar pain a few months later but not as bad. Then I felt nothing for a few years, but then last year I started getting a different pain in the upper right of my abdomen which felt horrible and I still get it. It feels like something is being grabbed and twisted, it can come on really suddenly at the most random times and really hurts. Then yesterday I was stood waiting for lesson and I felt a really sharp stabbing pain in the same area. I also get a swelling in that area when the pain is present. This contracting pain comes on really often and makes me hot.  It even kept me up until about 5.00 one morning and I only got three hours sleep before I had to be up for college.\\n\\nHere are some other symptoms:\\n-I always feel tired no matter how much sleep I get\\n-I have noticed areas of dark-red in my faeces a few times, as well as mucus\\n- At the moment, whenever I sit down I feel a dull pain between hips, above my private area.  I am not on my period. I also feel this when I sit backwards too far.\\n\\nI have been to the doctor on three occasions. One said I have IBS, and I was given tablets which didn\\'t help, the other two times they said it was a pulled muscle which I doubt, since I don\\'t have to be doing anything for the pain to come on.  I am getting nervous about going to the doctors though, I am even too nervous to tell my mum and dad about my problems. I mean I told my dad once and he just said \"Is it womens problems?\" which it definatley isn\\'t.\\n\\nPlease help!!!\\n\\nIf I go to the doctors again what should I do to keep the doctor interested for longer??? Do I mention the worst symptoms first? Write them down? Tell him I think I have Crohn\\'s?  I am not fishing around for possible diseases and thinking \"Ahh yes! I want that one!!\" because I don\\'t want to be diagnosed with anything, but at the same time I want answers.\\n\\nHow can I get over my developing fear of doctors and telling my parents I am still in pain?\\n\\nI am 19 by the way, and yes I do still live at home.\\nMy sis has had several abdominal surgeries in the past. The last 2 surgeries for abdominal\\nadhesions. She still has persistent abdominal discomfort but the most annoying\\nis the diarrhea at least 3 times a week. She is unable to work or travel\\nbecause she never knows when she\\'ll need a bathroom. Anyone familiar with\\nthis? Is it maybe diet? Initially post-op the MD explained how her bowel was\\nvirgin like(flora) because of the antibotics used during surgery to cleanse the bowel\\nand suggested acidophilis, but she still has the bowel problem.Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\\nHay PM\\nI have Crohns and if its Crohns its a light case but the area you mentioned\\nis a very busy area.

It can result in arthritis of large joints like the knee or ankle, but it can also result in semi-mobile joint arthritis i.e. between the ribs and the sternum.  This inflammation can go on for months and really cause a lot of problem for the person who has it.\\n\\nQuestion for you:  have you recently been on any prednisone for your Crohn disease, and if so, did the prednisone help with the chest pain?

Anyone who can give me some info or share their own experience, please help me. In novermber 2009 i was diagnosed with Ulcerative colitis. 2 mouths i had mucus and a few mount of blood in my stool 4-6 times in day. The doctor prescribed me Salazopyrin 16/11/2009. The colonoscopy was 19/11/2009. I took 2 tablets in the evening of 16/11/2009. Next morning i had not already mucus and a blood. I had stool without mucus and blood untill 23/11/2009. 23/11 I went to shop to buy some food i decided to call a doctor. I told her what i do not want to take tablets.

       " {'post': \"I have UC and during a trip to the ER for Bronchitis they found I was anemic. I went to my family Doc for further bloodwork and I am Iron deficiency anemic. He gave me ferrous sulfate which made me really dizzy.That was only one pill a day. He said with my GI bleeding they wanted to be careful not to make it worse.  So I called and told them about the side effect. They said to go to the store and ask for a recommendation on a different Iron and be sure to say what the slow fe did.\\nIs chelated Iron better then ferrous sulfate or is there a different one I should try first.   I am going to go to the health food store and get one. Anyone else  sensitive to synthetic Iron? I took prenatal vitamins ok and they have a lot of Iron in them so I am not sure why I had that reaction.\\nLeslie35--Yes, I am one of those people that cannot tolerate Ferris Sulfate, it gave me enteritis for 3 months and could not be stopped with any med's or by my GI doc, scary and lost 15 pounds.  It had to just run its course.  So, then my GI doc said I have two other options which was IM iron or Poly Iron and that he didn't recommend IV iron due to risks of it.  I was successful with the Poly Iron 150, which is 150 mg of iron and Vit-C included.  It is made for people that cannot tolerate iron.  You can also have a reaction to any fillers that may bind the iron as well.  Ferris Sulfate usually comes with 65 mg's of iron so you need to know an amount that your doctor is prescribing.  What I take is OTC but it is behind the pharmacy and you have to ask for it but you can buy without a script you just have to buy the box.  With a written script you can try 30 days.  With iron supplements you have to work with your body and what is tolerated by you may not be by others so you just have to try it.  But knowing your condition I would recommend something like Poly Iron IF your doc agrees to the amount.  I don't know how anemic you are.  I just know for me there was no other iron to give me the amount I needed so that my Hgb wouldn't drop further.  Ferris Sulfate on the other hand is extremely absorbable OMG!!!   But a killer on the GI tract for some.  You will find many doctors know nothing about iron supplement and supplements are NOT created equal.  I hear good things about the chelated iron on this board. You should also be sure that you know your ferritin level and that a B-12 and folate test was done.  Sometimes these are skipped and you don't get the whole picture.  Take care.  FLFG\\n\\nI take Floradix - it's liquid, and the iron form is ferrous gluconate - it's the only thing that didn't wreck my stomach. Tastes terrible, though, you must mix it with juice and take it through a straw or you will gag. But it raised my hemoglobin from 10 to 12 in 6 weeks. Now my hemoglobin ranges around 14. I feel like a new person.\\nThank you very much. I also have heard good things on chelated Iron. When I called my doctor and told him how dizzy I got he said to just go to the store and get a different type.\\nI am just over the mild anemia line into the moderate. I did not get a copy of my blood work but the nurse said my anemia was due to low iron.\\nI saw the floradix there and man I wish I could afford it especially since the specialist they had there had personal experiance with anemia and that product saved someone else she knew from a blood transfusion.  I got the second best thing though and got the pill form of the same type of iron. So far I am handling it just fine. I have even thought about asking to go on the dreaded steroids longer to make sure I do not bleed anymore so my anemia will get better that much faster.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Help!!  I had a thyroidectomy in October of 2004.  I have Crohn\\'s Disease, another auto-immune disorder.  I had always wondered why after thyroid surgery, my iron levels would be WAY out of control, WAY low, then suddenly appeared normal, but now in general, I take one ferrous gluconate a day.  I cannot \"tolerate\" the ferrous sulfate.  Still, I feel what seems like symptoms of anemia, but supposedly the iron is normal.  I have not felt normal or good since thyroidectomy.  I have intense chest weightyness that is located - I just discovered online, and after ruling out my heart as having any issues - where the thymus is.  This is another endocrine gland, it creates lymphocytes.  My lymphocyte count is normally low because I take Purinethol for the Crohn\\'s, or so that\\'s what they\\'re attributing it to.  But I never felt this weightyness in my chest before thyroidectomy.  I never had such intense fatigue, either.  Hair loss, etc.  It\\'s possible I\\'m having absorption issues that create iron-deficiency, or issues absorbing the Levothyroxine, or converting T3.  My thyroid levels appear to be in range at last check, but my symptoms are very, very, much there.  Depression like I can\\'t believe, and can\\'t control.  Massive mood swings during pms.  If I exercise, I have to lay down for hours.  If I do housework, my back is killing me, etc.  I can\\'t get through the day without Tylenol, at least twice daily.  I am taking 175 mcg of Levothyroxine, and one day per week, I take half a tablet.  I have looked up Wilson\\'s Temperature Syndrome just for its incredibly good explanation of T3 conversion and that helped to know.  Now I take my body temperature alot and it does always seem to be below normal.  I am at my wits end.  My doctor has me going to another endocrinologist on Thursday, but I\\'ve gone this route before, and they just send me to a lab and say the results appear okay.  But I am far from okay.  I could pass out from exhaustion and/or dizzyness each afternoon.  There is a definition relation with thyroid and iron, I notice.  This is incredibly depressing and frustrating.  I don\\'t know where to go from here.\\nSome things to consider-\\n- some people let their thyroid pills dissolve under their tongue to avoid irregular absorption problems if they have intestinal issues.\\n\\n- make sure they have screened you for celiac disease, an autoimmune reaction to gluten that can also cause intestinal problems and is more common in thyroid patients.\\n\\n- ask the endo to run a free T4 and free T3 with your next blood test - this will let you know if you are converting T4 to T3.  Some people do better taking both T4 and T3, still other don\\'t improve unless they take Armour (pig thyroid - the old-fashioned treatment that was used for decades before Synthroid came out.)\\n\\n- Also, various vitamin deficiencies can interfere with proper utilization of thyroid hormone, and since you have Crohn\\'s, you are at risk of deficiencies.  What vitamins do you take right now?\\n\\nEllie\\nThank you!  I take a multi-vitamin, Vitamin E...B-12 shots, hmmm, what else...\\nI saw an Endo doc today who is now doing the free T3 and T4 test.  Phew.  And they may want to take me off Levothyroxine and switch me to Levoxyl plus Liothyronine, which has its own T3.  These doctors don\\'t believe that Armour is better just because it\\'s an animal derivitive (because it\\'s also really expensive).  So, we\\'ll see!  I never heard of celiac disease....\\n\"These doctors don\\'t believe that Armour is better just because it\\'s an animal derivitive (because it\\'s also really expensive). So, we\\'ll see! I never heard of celiac disease....\\n\"\\n\\nArmour is actually very, very cheap. And was used successfully for decades before Synthroid was invented.  When Synthroid came out, pharm reps engaged in a campaign of disinformation so that docs would quit prescribing Armour and switch to (more expensive ATT) Synthroid.  Most docs don\\'t understand that there is no scientific basis for many of the lies they were told about Armour.  That being said - some people seem to do great on it, others don\\'t.\\n\\nCeliac disease is an autoimmune disease caused by a reaction to the gluten in wheat and certain other grains. Classic symptoms include chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and sometimes a particular skin rash called dermatitis herpetiformis, but many people have much milder symptoms. People with celiac disease have abnormalities on biopsy of the small intestine, and those changes revert to normal if they follow a strictly no-gluten diet.  Although a small-intestine biopsy is considered the \"gold standard\" of diagnosis, blood tests for antibodies (anti-ttg or anti-ema or anti-gliadin) can do a pretty good job of screening for it.  It\\'s the rare case of an autoimmune disease totally treatable by diet.\\n\\nEllie\\nPS -\\nHere\\'s a link to a research paper about the high incidence of celiac disease in patients with Crohn\\'s disease.\\n\\n[url]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=A  bstract&list_uids=15973121&query_hl=12&i  tool=pubmed_docsum[/url]\\n\\nThey found 20% had celiac disease.  You might want to print this off and discuss it with your doctors.\\n\\nEllie',\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi has anyone ever got acute diarrhea from ulcerative colitis (or ulcerative proctitis)?  I was diagnosed with this over a year ago and it's been flaring up off and on.  However, for the past week or so it's been really bad in that I have really bad diarrhea.  With this condition normally there is an urge to go more often, but now I have to empty about 10 minutes after consuming anything.  I'm not sure whether the diarrhea is caused by the colitis or an infection, or both.  If it's an infection I imagine it will go away eventually, but will it go away if it's form the colitis?  I can't eat anything and I'm getting really worried.  I'm going for a blood test and stool test tomorrow.  I'm losing weight like crazy and getting depressed.  I can't even seem to tolerate saltless crackers or a soft banana.  I'm trying to stay hydrated as best as possible with gatorade.  The other weird thing is it's not totally watery like diarrhea I've had in the past.  The stools are small and stringy but still have somewhat of a form and they usually explode out.  And of course there is mucus and blood and when I wipe.  Any advice or comments?  What's going on?\\n\\nBruce\\nbump bump bump\\nSure you can get diarrhea from inflammatory bowel conditions.That is what it is here!Keep eating and maintain nutrition.\\nOk thanks.  I will do that.  Does it matter what foods I intake?  I mean should I stay away from certain foods and favor others?  Also. is it ever going to stop???  It's really affecting my work life.\\n\\nHi Bruce,\\n\\nI have Crohns disease which is very similar to UC. The diarrhea should stop when you have the condition under control. You didn't mention if you're taking any medication and what success you've had with it? Perhaps you should discuss chaging your medication with your doctor if it's not working. Also are you getting the severe pain when you go to the loo or is it just diarrhea? In which case it could be an infection if just the diarrhea. I've battled with Crohns for almost 4 years now, chaning medications so many times I've lost count as they didn't work. After I reached a dead end last year I came across the work of Elaine Gottschall who devised a diet based on a gastroenterologists work as her daughter had severe ulcerative colitis. Have a look and see what you think, it's really restrictive at first but then you may find after a year that you can eat many of the things you couldn't. Do discuss this with your doctor if you want to try it, it is a strict medical diet.\\n\\nAll I can say is that I'm not on medication (which really is amazing for me) and I've taken back the control it had over my life - so long as I stick to the things I can eat that is!\\nI have hardly any symptoms at all now from something which is so aggressive. If you do want any more information about it just look her up or the 'specific carbohydrate diet' and no it's not a fad diet. You should find after about three weeks of being on the diet a great improvement in your bowel movements. Do contact me if you want to ask anyting about it.\\n\\nThe question about it being an infection is difficult as well, when I was suffering with diarrhea and a lot of pain, I'd already tried another courses of steroids but that time it had no effect on bringing it under control. So along with my usual medication he precribed a really high does of anti-biotics for about a month (which probably ruined any good bacteria I had) - this kills off all bacteria good or bad and it did stop the flare up. So in a way it is an infection anyway. The good thing is this diet deals with that. The science behind it is too complicated for me to explain but reasearch it and see what you think, it makes sense. I was surprised that my doctor had never mentioned this diet to me but from seeing him every month I'm now not going to see him for two years unless I get ill in the mean time. Fingers crossed.\\n\\nHope you feel better soon, I know what hell it can be and yes it is normal with this condition when you hjave a flare up to go that often. At one point I would eat and whilst I was eating after a few minutes (not even 10) I would have really severe cramps and have to go to the loo, you're not alone!\\nHi Cookie thanks for the reply.  It's kinda comforting to hear other people's stories.\\n\\nAs for medication, 2 years ago a doctor had put me on Colazal (9 pills/day).  And it seemed to work well.  Stopped the bleeding and everything.  But eventually I had to change insurance companies and I had to get a new doctor and things just became a mess because I was moving to Canada.  So I stopped the medication and the bleeding did come back, but came and went, no really bad diarrhea or anything.  At one point everything was so great and I was feeling wonderful, I was totally regular.  But that didn't last long.  And now two years later it's gotten really bad again.  I can't say I have severe pain when I go, but there is a lot of blood and mucus everytime and it is really sore afterwards, presumably from just sitting on toilet so much and going so often.  It's just an uncomfortable feeling, but not severe pain yet.\\n\\nI now live in Canada, and yes the healthcare here is free, but the actual care sucks compared to what is offerred in America.  I finally have an appointment to see a gastroenterologist, but that appt. is on June 20th!  So I have to wait until then.  I had the blood and stool tests last week and I'm still waiting on the GP to get back to me.\\n\\nAnyways I looked into the SCD you mentioned.  It sound very interesting and I'm definitely going to read up more on it.  It does seem very restrictive, but maybe that's just because we have all been a little spoiled with all the processed foods we eat.  One of the things that doesn't seem to make sense is that it says you should stay away from all sugars including fructose.  Yet there are many fruits allowed which all contain high amounts of fructose (i.e. fruit sugar).  Also I thought even commercial yogurt had no lactose in it and so it should be ok, but not according to the diet.  Do you think it would help to not do the diet strictly, but follow it more or less on most of what it recommends?\\n\\nI will discuss the diet with 'my' doctor when I get one, unfortunately the concept of having your own doctor here in Canada is a foreign one.  Anyways, thanks again for your reply, I actually felt a little better down there after reading it\\n\\nI've had UC on and off since 1992 and it is no joy\\nRight now I am going through a flare - last one was 2 years ago.   I also have fibromyalgia in the worse way and it is also in a flare.   On top of all that, I think I am having an active infection of the Ebstein Barr again.\\n\\nCurrently I am not taking meds due to a quick outpatient surgery coming up on Monday.   I hope to get this under control before I have to start taking the meds again.   I take Asacol and Bentyl.\\n\\nAs far as foods to avoid - my gastro said to eat what I can and what is tolerable.   Of course, he means eating good wholesome nutritious foods and not junk.   I find that steamed carrots, salty broth, canned green beans, rice all work pretty well with me during a flare.    Generally, raw foods do not sit well with me.    Today cheese set me off and running to the bathroom.\\n\\nHope you are feeling better soon.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Today i have been diagnosed with crohns disease im only 17 and have no idea what it is .. i just no i have been so ill for 2 months ... could someone please enlighten me x\\nHello Jadeylex,\\nSo sorry to hear that you have Crohns. I hope I can shed some light on your situation. I was the same exact age as you when I found out that I had Crohns. I am now 36. I want tell you it has always been easy, because it has not. But you can live a somewhat \"normal\" life being a Crohns patience. Crohns is a inflammatory bowel disease that affect the colon, small & large intestines, rectum, stomach. Pretty much its your insides attacking itself. When it flares up, you form sores in the lining of your stomach, colon, etc. and when you eat or drink it makes it hurt worse. It also cause you to pass blood thru your rectum, most of the time you probably don\\'t realize it. It can affect your joints, eyes, immune system. You may notice that it takes you longer to get well after being sick or have surgery. I am not trying to scare you, I just want to let you know the real deal!!! Because I wish that I had someone to tell me all this stuff way back then. I was basically a guinea pig for the Dr.s, because at that time you didn\\'t hear to much about Crohns disease. They actually though I had stomach cancer at first. I was scared to death. Well I hope that this will help you. I made it and you can make it to. You have modern technology on your side so thats a plus. Take care of yourself and you live your life with Crohns not Crohns running your life. Because it can happen if you let it. Stay strong and be blessed!\\n\\nPraying for you,\\nToni\\nits a inflammation of your digestive system.

See GI doc tomorrow for follow up appt.\\nthankyou so much toni x\\n\\n\\n\\nMy grandson was diagnosed in March with Chrons at 5 years old. Since there is not many children that young with it, and children this young don\\'t explain their pain and symtoms very well we need all the input we can get on what to do to help him. Anyone who has any good info please help us out.\\nHello Westlee,\\n\\nSorry to hear that your grandson has Crohns. Well I have soundly say I know how it feels and I know what you are going thru.  I have crohns myself and last August my 12yr. old son was diagnose with it. His G.I. dr. put him on several meds, about 5, to be exact. He also has acid reflux, a hiatal hernia and stomach ulcers. I guess you can say the fruit don\\'t fall to far from thee tree, because I have ALL those things too.The best advice I can give you is, to make sure you have a good G.I. dr. One that has your grandson best interest at hand. Next make sure what ever meds that are given, your grandson takes them fately!! Living with crohns is not easy, but you have a  normal life. Make sure you look for any signs that don\\'t seem right. Crohns can memic a stomach virus, make it easier for you to get sick, cause low blood counts, etc. I pray that everything will work out and your grandson can live a somewhat normal life. It may get hard at times, but he will make!!\\n\\nBe blessed,\\nToni\\nask my sister she can telll you all about it  she is 55 , had it since she was 20 .\\nMy son has it too. He\\'s almost 13. He has to watch what he eats and drinks, especially foods that contain high fructose corn syrup. His doc did a test on him and he\\'s highly allergic to it. We went the natural route and put him on fish oil and vitamins. It has helped alot with his symptoms.\\n\\nHi, I was diagnosed with crohns in 2006, it is a disease that hits your digestive system, (causing ulcors), there are alot of treatments but I cant lie you will go through times where you feel ill, but there is light at the end of the tunnel, I got there.\\n\\n\\nThanks so much for your reply. He has been put on two meds and he goes to the hospital every 6 weeks for a treatment called infusion he get through the vein, it takes 2 or 3 hours. He is doing well most of the time, he has had a couple of flare ups. If you have anymore information please let me know,and thanks again.',\n",

On top of that, it seemed like my gyn. and the colon dr. had different opinions about what to do from time to time, which was difficult for me to sort out.  Please don't rule out that you may need to have your remaining ovary checked out.  It's wonderful how stable your Chrohns has been for so long.

Apparently mesalazine is for people who have crohn\\'s in the large bowel not the small bowel, so he has put me on pentasa (sp). He has also put me on a course of antibiotics to clear up any bacteria that may be lurking about and making it worse. he has also started to lower my steroids, which i\\'m glad about.\\n\\nHe aslo mentioned another drug which has said i may benefit from but due to the risks he has asked me to go away and thik about it .......azathioprine. Apparently it can mess up a person\\'s bone marrow so this is why he has asked me to think about it first and go back in two weeks with an answer. So i would love to hear from anyone who has had exeprience of this drug.\\n\\nHe also examined my stomach and part of my small bowel is swollen, he could actually feel it and this is what is having problems reacting to the meds, for some reason it isnt sorting that bit of my small bowel out.

I am so happy you are doing well and have such a great consultant. I was actually going to make a thread to you asking if you were back at work yet - couldn\\'t really remember the date, although I thought it not til early June - and to ask how you were doing\\n\\n\\nIt isn\\'t great that you have a stricture and could possibly have to have it removed, but, hopefully the new drugs will be your cure. Your luck and health have seemed to take a good turn up - I\\'ll keep my fingers crossed that they stay that way\\n\\nI am doing well. Watching my diet as usual. I have found I am more lactose intolerant than first suspected (all cheese, \"lactose free\" milks, some of my medicines!, etc. I have to read labels very closely) - so knowing that has helped. Funny though, from reading these boards, I should have known better. Shame on me for being ignorant\\n\\n\\nI am feeling better... but not as good as I feel I should be feeling. Still having pain, and having some joint issues still. But I\\'m at a stand still. Theres nothing more the GP can do, hes just trying to keep my vitamin levels in check... so I\\'m waiting on an indecisive Gastro... lol doesn\\'t seem like a good start. Trying to keep as active as possible.\\n\\nI hope someone has some info on the azathioprine for you. There seems to be a few more people lurking around now that have Crohn\\'s... so hopefully someone has some insight for you.\\n\\nCheers to continued improvements\\n\\n\\nAngela\\n\\nHi Sharon... I just wanted to add my two cents worth on the azathioprine... for what its worth\\n\\nI have had a quiet morning so far, and decided to research a bit on the drug as I am curious. You probably already know all that I am going to say - but I will share anyway\\n\\n\\nAzathioprine is an Immunosupressive... therefore comprises your body\\'s ability to ward/fight off infection. This in itself can be a problem. In Crohn\\'s disease, it can take up to six months, or more, to see results from azathioprine. Side effects include reduced appetite and nausea, sometimes vomiting, and canker sores in the mouth. A serious (and life threatening) side effect is reduced activity of bone marrow, but this can be monitored with regular blood tests. As well, users should watch for unusual bleeding and/or bruising. Some people may develop pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) some months after starting these drugs.\\n\\nAfter reading all of that... and more... in my opinion I think I would skeptical on starting this drug. Yes, it can be monitored... but how quickly will the monitoring pick up on any damages... and how quickly can they be reversed (ie bone marrow)?\\n\\nSix months is a long time as well. You already have a stricture... and if it takes this drug the six months to take full effect... how much will your stricture be progressed? I would want my consultant to answer this for me.\\n\\nApparently, the 5 ASA\\'s work very well, but only in large doses. I think I read 4 to 4.8 grams a day - that equates to 12 pills of Asacol or 16 pills of pentasa... were you taking this high a dose? I believe you are way past this point... but thought it was very interesting when I read that. It\\'s from a lecture by David Sachar, Professor Emeritus, Gastoenterology Division, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY.\\n\\nThere is a really good MSN group - Crohn\\'s Disease in the UK .... have you found this one? I googled \"aziathioprine side effects\" and found it that way.\\n\\nI know none of what I said is really what you are looking for. Nothing can replace a person\\'s personal expereince story. But I just wanted to share my thoughts on it. I know you probably are fully aware of everything I said...\\n\\nCheers\\nAngela\\nHi Anglea\\n\\nActually i havent researched the drug yet so im grateful for that. I spoke to soon the other day when i said i was ok...............i had a bad flare up yesterday, trying to get on top of it.......had no sleep coz of the pain and nothing to eat for two days!!!\\n\\nAnyway, i\\'m abit unsure myself about this drug, it can do alot of damage and is this damage irreversible??? that is what worries me. I have been told by my consultant that at the the moment they have a trial and it where its a special blood test to see if this drug will mess up your bone marrow, apparently it tests your bone marrow and gives a percentage of how likely you are to suffer from bone morrow problems if you go on this drug. And they do this before you go on the actual drug. Saying this i\\'m still unsure.\\n\\n\\nmy meds have been changed to Pentasa........a really high dose, im on 2000mg daily and im on 15mg prednisolone, along with antibiotics. Im feeling pretty crap at the mo coz of the side effects . They wont give me pain relief as it will aggravate my stomach and bowel more, so they are waiting to see if my meds will work again.\\n\\nI just want the bad part removed and then i can start a fresh with this illness.\\n\\nI dont know anymore what will help, i really thought the meds would once i started on them, but its as if my body has got used to them and they are no longer working. But saying that once these new tablets are in my system they may work.\\nHi Sharon - Just a thought....\\n\\nDo you think you could handle in increase in pentasa? According to what I read you are only taking half of the recommended effective dose. Maybe an increase would help you??? I find it weird how the list of side effects for Pentasa are somewhat parallel to those of the Crohn\\'s... the pain, diarrhea, joint pain, and so on... seems contradictory to me, to give a medicine that can cause what they\\'re trying to help.\\n\\nI hope this settles for you. Hang in there. These decisions are always so difficult, do what you feel is best for you. If you are managing without the azathioprine - maybe the risks will be just not worth it... but only you will know if it is.\\n\\nAngela\\nI got it wrong, i\\'m actually on 4000mg of pentasa daily, which is the higher dose i think.\\n\\nAlso i have just found some interesting info on crohn\\'s.\\n\\nApparently there is a bacteria that is present in cows called MAP, this has the same symptoms in cows as people with regards to crohn\\'s. A study has been done with lots of research and this bacteria can be passed along to humans by infected milk from cows. Apparently the level that they pasturise milk at is not high enough to kill this bug. And it can also be passed along from meat by cows. The disease in cows is know as johnes disease. But the worrying thing is this MAP bug is also present in the environment!!! It can also be carried in water.\\n\\nWhilst doing this research they also discovered that alot of people with crohns had this MAp bug in their system.\\n\\n\\nBut saying this the researchers cannot say that this is the sole cause of crohns in humans, there are many other factors which can cause it. At the moment scientists are working on a vaccine for crohns and hopefully get rid of this bug which is contributing to crohns.\\n\\n\\n\\nI found this interesting.\\nI read something similar while researching yesterday. It is very interesting indeed. Makes ya wonder.\\n\\nAlot of people with Crohn\\'s are \"lactose\" intolerant... is it possible its this MAP bug and not the lactose? Just an idea. I\\'d like to know what they find in their further studies.\\n\\nHow are you feeling today? (And I figured a bump would be nice\\nHoping someone still has some info on the azathioprine... Have you made any further decision?)\\n\\nAngela\\nWell my son has autoimmune hepatitis and has been on 6-mp since dec \\'05.What he is on(6-mp), is what azathiprine(or Imuran)(Its the brand name of aza)turns into once you take  it. From what I have learned is that they check your metabolites for this drug before you take it (TPMP level)to see how low of a dose to start it,Then his levels are checked once a month. Actually his were way too high for a couple of months and had to lower his dose.This drug helps to put you on a lower dose of steroids(called also a steroid sparing drug).It does take a couple of months to begin to work effectively, that is why they usually start with steroids and the Imuran, then taper the steroids down.Hope that helps some! You may want to check out Prometheus labs website, It is the lab that tests the metabolite levels.\\nmfife31\\nHi Mfife\\n\\nHAs your son had any bad side effects or problems since being on them?\\nHi! Actually we havent really noticed any so far.The only time we did was when the metabolite of the drug got too high.. then his bilirubin went to 4.5 his platelets dropped slightly to 110. But as far as how he felt no. And once it was reduced , the blood labs went back to normal. Good luck to you!! I am a member of autoimmune hepatitis group and there is alot of info about the azathioprine. There are quite a few there who take it.\\nMfife31',\n",

This is the usual place for pain with colitis and also it causes constipation.\\n\\nAlso the pain could be coming from the large again this causes pain in the upper area and down the right side. but remember that with crohn's the pain is generally around the right side and goes in the back.\\n\\nThe reason why you are in pain when you move m ay be because your bowel is inflammed or narrowed.\\n\\nI have crohn's and my pain is always down the right side but lower down. Also i suffer from constipation when my small bowel becomes narrow and an obstruction occurs.\\n\\nI am waiting to have surgery down very soon as my small bowel has narrowed.\\n\\nhave you had a barium meal done?? this will show up any narrowing in the bowel.\\nthanks for your message\\nwhere i have my crohns and where i have my pain are very far apart, and my crohns is fine at the mo so i know its nothing to do with that. am having a barium on thursday so have a gander and see whats going on\\n\\ngood luck with your surgery\\nHopefully the barium will show something up and put an end to the pain.\\n\\nWhere do you have crohn's?\",\n",

Should I get this checked out, or is this normal for a 1 year old?  It's likely that she's teething, but she has loose bowels even when she's not teething.\\n\\nRebbie\\nThe thing is crohn's doesn't always has to be inherited.\\nI have it and i am the onyl one in ym entire family who has crohns!\\n\\n\\nMy son has problems with his bowels and he is under the hospital at the moment, he is 8 years old and i am concerned that he may develop it.\\n\\nThey say that if a child shows signs it is usually from the ages of 10 upwards, but with there being a history of corhn's i would ask the gp and see what he says.

When I was pregnant, I was obviously concerned that I might pass this on to my baby, but was advised by my doctors that this wouldn't necessarily be the case.

       " {'post': 'hi everyone, this is my first time posting here so be nice please\\n. be warned tough the following is pretty gross! over the past year i have noticed blood in my stools, its not all the time, usually once a month and the other week there was just a really excessive amount of blood so now im doing some research to try and find out what it is. my uncla had crohns disease and my grandfather has colon cancer and my cousin and mum are aneamic (all on mothers side), so as you might see, it doesnt look to optimistic!\\nso basically i was hoping if someone could tell me at what stage should i see a dr as i am quite reluctant to and what their symptoms involved if they have/had anything like this.\\nsome other symptoms i have noticed are:\\nsore eyes\\ntiredness\\nstrong abdominal cramping\\na fluttering in the lower right side of my chest\\nheadaches\\ni have also had tonsillitis 2 times in the past 3 months\\ni am not diagnosed with ANY medical conditions except for hsc stress! lol\\nany help would be greatly appreciated, thanx in advance\\nWoah, first thing i want to comment on is your question \"at what stage should u see a doctor\".. Now would be a good time. blood in the stool can be from something as minor as hemmoriods to something as serious as cancer. you should ALWAYS  get checked if you are experiance this!\\n\\nbecause you mention crohns disease and colon cancer as condtions that run in your family, i thought id point out, that in both cases, the eariler its detected, the more chance you have at sorting it out before it gets worse..sounds obvious, but why wait if there is any potential for things to get more complicated!\\n\\nI had surgery for crohns disease about 6 years ago, and a few of my symptoms are the same as what you are experiancing, the tiredness, the sore eyes and the abdominal pain.. i have had no experiance with colon cancer so i cant comment on that but i really think you need to make an appointment with the doc and find out whats going on, it really is your best move. it could be nothing or it could be something. find out.\\n\\nthanks for the reply. i know i should see a dr and this will probly sound very immature, but i just feel uncomfortable discussing it. and i have been to the dr\\'s 3 times within the past 3 months which is a record for me atm, and for some reason i just think its seen as a cry for attention. maybe just me watching house to much of \"dr. house\" though?\\njust a few more questions: how do they diagnose it? and are there any other symptoms that are common to it?\\nLike you, I abhor going to the doctor. Prior to this year, I hadn\\'t been to a doctor (other than eye doctor and dentist) in about 10 years. But since January, I\\'ve now been to the doctor at least twice a month. I already have 4 appointments scheduled for June.\\nIt\\'s not fun, but it\\'s bearable. You won\\'t be showing or telling the doctor anything he/she hasn\\'t come across before. Just think of each doctor\\'s visit as one brief moment out of one day of your life-that\\'s what I do, and it helps me.\\nI have some of the same symptoms you do-abdominal pain, blood in stool, fatigue, headaches.  Even after all my doctor\\'s visits, I still don\\'t have a diagnosis. Unfortunately, I think a lot of possible diseases share a lot of the same symptoms, like Chron\\'s and colon cancer.\\nI have a colonoscopy scheduled in June, as well as other tests, and I think it sounds like you need to get yourself scheduled for one as well. As other posters on this board have told me, rectal bleeding is never normal and should be checked out.\\nGood luck, and make that appointment!\\nI do not have experience with crohns disease though a very good friend of my wife\\'s just diagnosed with it.  It can be diagnosed with a colonoscopy if it is in the large intestines I believe (I think it can also be in the small intestines but I do not know how they diagnose it there)\\nBottom line is please take control of your health and go to the dr. explain ALL your symptoms and concerns.  The dr. has heard it all and they get paid to listen to embarrasing/uncomfortable things (and trust me there is always someone else that has symptoms more embarrasing), if they didn\\'t they\\'d be out of a job.\\nDepending on your age I urge you to get a colonoscopy regardless of symptoms  considering your grandfather has colon cancer, it is the number one preventable cancer if detected early (they can also take polyps out at the same during the colonoscopy that could turn into cancer years down the road, they took 3 out during mine).\\nI had mine done about a month ago as my father died from colon cancer in his 50\\'s, chances are that is not your problem but it was very easy and the peace of mind is nice to have.\\nBlood in the stool is not normal and is likely something minor but take control of your health and get on the road to recovery and feeling better.\\nthanks for all the replies, i guess the that im just going to have to bite the bullet on this one because i guess it is easier to treat when detected early. i will let u know if or when i get a diagnosis what it is!\\nGo to the doctors ASAP.  My 16 year old daughter was just diagnosed with Crohn\\'s disease.  Her symptoms were fatigue, pain/cramping in the stomach all the time, and her eyes, well the pupils become dilated and wouldn\\'t go back to normal.  She had this for a year and a half before she was diagnosed.  She had normal bowels, and no blood, so they kept thinking it wasn\\'t Crohn\\'s, but her Sed rate in her blood tests were always pretty high.  She has just started medication, and so far she doesn\\'t see much difference.  It is so important to get to the doctors!!!  My daughter\\'s doc kept telling her it was IBS and putting her on meds that made her worse, well we didn\\'t listen to him, and kept pushing, and finally got the right diagnosis.  It took many visits, and many tests, the last was a colonoscopy(which looked normal) but when they checked out the biopsies they found the problem.  See the doctor, and then keep at it until you feel better.  I wish you the best of luck!!!\\nKathy\\n\\nPS If your doctor is making you feel like you are \"crying for help\", find another doctor.  Ask your friends, ask you co-workers who they see.  Also, if your insurance allows you to go directly to specialists without a referral, you need to see a GI doctor, that way you are going right to the guy who knows what he is talking about, and skipping the middle man.\\nkathy, sorry to hear about your daughter, hope the treatments will help her. i am booking an appointment this week! i promise myself lol. kathy, how exactly did they diagnose it in the end? osunds like a lot of testing needs doing from what i hear\\ntoomanyquestions.. have you been to the dr yet? please let us know how it goes when you do!\\n\\nKathy, Im glad your daughter has finally been diagnosed, it took them along time to diagnose me too, i got the whole eat more vegtables\" speech time and time again, it was rediculas..  My eyes dialated as well, funny now when i look back but my mum thought i was on drugs!! lol  I hope she and you toomany, are feelin better soon! take care\\n\\nno im going tomorrow afternoon! (promises myself) after looking at human organs all day at the university of nsw and seeing some of these things first hand im definately going! lol so yes im nervously waiting for tomorrow or thursday and will let u know what they say if i feel right about doing so, thanks all for your support, its really comforting and nice too know im not the only one in these sort of situations\\ni was goood! i went to the dr\\'s! and now i have a referral to a specialist, she couldnt really tell me much though coz she didnt have the right equipment, so more anxious waiting for me!\\nme again! im about to schedule an appointment with the specialist and i was just wondering what they are likely to do? will i be in for the full colonoscopy and stuff like that or is that more of a mjor procedure? enlighten me please\\noh my gosh no one tolde me about the $$$ of specialists lol being sick sucks\\nI went through much the same thing you are going through a few years ago. I fretted and fretted over a decsion I should not have had to.  Finally I went for a colostomy and the gastro doctor found 4 or 5 polyps...no cancer.  I was relieved to get this information because my grandmother died of stomach cancer a horriable way to die.  Since then I have had 7 surgeries and vowed not to have another one but alas, I think one is in my near future.  My surgeries did not involved colon or stomach for which I was glad...Now as for you...PLEASE go for the tests your doctor wants to do and get it over with. As for baring your soul among other things, to your doctor...We all lose our dignity thats for sure but a doctor has seen it all and will continue to see it all as long as he is in practice and as long as people get sick!  It is always better to face a problem and possibly have a good conclusion reached than it is to worry and always think it might be this or that. Believe me I know!  I wish you well and that you will come out of this in good health.',\n",

I have 2 small kids that need me and i can get it out of my mind that i have cancer and am going to die.\\n\\nI was also wanting to know since it been so long since i had a so called flare up what exactly is considered a mild flare? I dont realy have any pain other then the tenderness when i press my lower ab area , i dont have bad diarhea (its soft but not watery diareha) and only basiclly go once in the am.\\n\\nThe only thing i have is the achy back and the what i think is heartburn along with the tenderness .... does this sound like a flare up to you?\\n\\nI do have other pains but i think i am starting to imagine them now since i saw that dam result page.\\nHi....it sounds to be early flare symptoms.  I have UC and that sounds similar.   Is your crohn\\'s colitis throughout your colon or just in the upper part of the colon?\\n\\nWhat are the doctor\\'s next stage of testing for you?  Did he take any blood tests the day you saw him?\\n\\nYou could try Zantac and see if that helps with some of the heartburn.  75mg dosage to start at least should give you some reprieve.  It works for me.\\n\\nI\\'d be scared too....but posting and seeking other info/perspectives is a good way in gaining info and dealing with the anxiety.\\n\\nDo you have a copy of the report and if so, what exactly did the last line say?\\n\\n\\nquincy\\nQuincy--\\nSorry for butting in but I certainly have missed you on this board!!!\\n\\nGod Bless~~~Harry\\nhi Harry!!!  yeah, I took a break because I was on dial-up and it took so darned long to ******** each page.Too frustrating.  I\\'m now on high-speed, but there are days this board is still slow...so, can\\'t totally blame my computer I guess -- lots of people on here.\\n\\nGood to see you!\\n\\nq\\nHi, my name is Amanda.  This is my first post on this board, so hi to all.  I have crohns and was diagnosed about a year ago, but have been having symptoms of the disease for over three years.  After my first endoscopy, I saw the exact same word, lymphoma, on my results and was given the EXACT SAME answer by my doctor, that they didn\\'t know why it would say that.  He told me not to worry.  How are you not gonna worry when they put that on there and then say, i don\\'t really know why it says that!!  I have no answer to give you other than I was told the same thing, so if you get more info, that would be great!  Peace to all.\\nI am reading this board because my daughter has proctitis and I am trying to learn more about it.\\n\\nHowever, in reading this thread about the radiologist puts down one thing but the docs say \"not to worry about it\", I am reminded about a 20:20 or Dateline show recently about medical system mistakes.  The \"System\" is just full of potential for errors and mistakes and there is documented proof of the stats on this.  Various medical \"boards\" say that improvements are needed.\\n\\nI have personally vowed for my wife and myself (and family) that if we get any kind of result that is not fully explained and documented and that we understand, that we are going to raise a stink until any confusion or discrepancies are resolved.  This may mean repeating the tests or getting a second lab or specialist to review the results, but nebulous platitudes about \"not to worry\" will not be sufficient for me ever again.\\n\\nI don\\'t mean to be an alarmist, esp if you now feel \"comforted\", but remember that the statistics on medical system errors and mistakes is at levels that are uncomfortable at best and sinful at worst.',\n",

I couldn't get rid of them for anything and then I started taking my Pentasa and my chin is clearing up.  I had no idea Crohn's could maybe cause pimples... or is it all in my head?\\n\\nSecond of all, ever since I've had Crohn's, whenever I needed to use the bathroom (Number 2), I would have mucus come out of my vagina.  Is this normal?  It always happens that way.  If I can't use the bathroom immediately I feel like I get wet down there and it's embarassing even though no one knows. Does anyone else have this happen to them?\\n\\nThanks!\\nHi I have crohn's and it can cause skin problems. I am problems with my skin at the moment, i get like lumps under my skin around my hairline!!! It is annoying and my steroids and pentasa are not clearing it up.\\n\\nAlso as for the mucus, you nay have a fistula which you need to get checked out.\\n\\nI just had bowel surgery due to the crohn's only 3 weeks ago and im worried it is flaring up again\\n\\nIf i can be of any more help let ne know.\\n\\n\\nSharon\\nI have a theory about this.  It's not based on any medical evidence, just a theory.\\n\\nI rarely had pimples when I was growing up, but when my Crohn's was under control I got them.  I think it is because when your Crohn's is bad you are not getting the goodness or the badness from anything you eat, because it goes straight through you, if you know what I mean.  Then, when your Crohn's is under control, you get the benefits and also, unfortunately, the disadvantages of processing your food efficiently.  I used to scoff bags of chocolate bars before I had a bowel resection without putting on weight or getting spots, then afterwards I felt great, but unfortunately also got spots, greasy hair, the works. It was a small price to pay for feeling a hell of a lot healthier.  Now I have to watch my weight and eat more healthily to prevent spots, etc.\\n\\nRebbie\\nI've never had a problem with pimples but I do get cold sores on my lips and inside my mouth.\\nI have had crohn's disease for 6 years. I also have bump-like pimples under my skin on my face, especially the chin,nose and hairline. The only treatment that has worked is a short dose of an antibiotic. It has been diagnosed (in error, I feel) as adult acne and rosacea. Good luck.\\nHi Dutch\\n\\nMiine are around my hairline also, sometimes they get sore to touch. It is so annoying. I never had then before i got ill, and i do know that crohn's can cause skin problems. I doubt yours is adult acne........seems strange in this thread so far the majority of us have them along with crohn's!!!\\nI also have Chron's and the pimples and the hairline bumps .it seems like when one goes away three more show up.\\nIt must be because the immune system is that messed up it brings everything out.\\n\\nit's right what you said, one goes and i think great they are clearing up and then the next thing i have an outbreak of more! They are not spots as such they are lumps under my skin, right along my hairline and they are sore to touch!\\n\\nIs there anything the crohn's doesn't cause???\\nI think those bumps you guys are talking about are the only things I don't get with this cursed disease.  I guess I can be thankful for that lol.\\nLol\\n\\nYes!!! you be grateful you don't get them! Oh well, you're not that pathetic twisten, you don't have as many symptoms as you think\\n\",\n",

The dr. and the childrens hospital in the area think that it is Crohns, but we are still not getting conclusive findings.  We were told it can take up to 3 years to get an answer.  In just over 1 year she had 3 procedures (endoscopy's and colonoscopys).  Each time they took about 30 biopsys.  Still inconclusive results with them and blood.  We did find out that she produces NO Lactase so she is following a lactose free diet.  She also has been getting migraines for the past 2 years so we follow a certain diet to help limit those attacks.  Adding to that we try to follow a acid reflux diet to help the asophogase stay as calm as possible.   Now they put her on Pantasa again to help with the inflammation.  She has been on it for 2 weeks and we have had no pain.  Now the dr. wants us to try the Gluten free diet in addition to see if it is that.  If she is on Pantasa (an antinflammatory med)  how will we know if it is the Pantasa or the Gluten?  we are very confused.  She did test positive that she carries the genetic capability to have the gluten problem but it still shows up negative in the blood work.\\nIf anyone has answers please let me know\",\n",

       " {'post': \"It drives me crazy that there really isn't a place for Crohn's Disease on these boards! I've been a member since May '06 and I haven't visited in awhile. In that time, I can't seem to find the old threads I had posted on before.\\n\\nAnyway, I was diagnosed with Crohn's (finally) this past November. My doctors started me with Bentyl for the cramping and Budesonide to treat the Crohn's. After 2 months, that hasn't helped. So, as of yesterday, I was switched to Pentasa.\\n\\n\\nHas anyone had any success for treating Crohn's? If so, with what medications? I'm still having a difficult time adjusting to living with Crohn's and any/all advice, suggestions, etc would be helpful.  OR, if there are any other Crohn's threads, I'd appreciate a link!\\n\\nThanks\\n-Sherri\\nI am suffering from Crohn's just like you. And I am fearful of my lifestyle in the future. I had an abscess that formed in August, and my colorectal surgeon drained it and put seton tubes in it. After that was finished, the healing process was very, VERY slow, due to the Crohn's. My gastroenterologist prescribed Entocort first, which is a mild drug used to treat the disease, but for months of taking it, it has had little to no effect on me. The infection is still there, and they are going to use a last resort treatment called remicade. My infusion is scheduled for tomorrow. Apparently it's a gastroenterologist's final solution before doing more surgery.\\n\\nSo, if you see your doctor, hopefully he has talked to you about the possibility of drugs such as entocort, prendizone, and Remicade to treat your Crohn's disease. Each one being successively more potent.\\nHi there,\\n\\nThanks for posting.\\nI actually started out on Budesonide, which is Endocort. (Endocort is the generic version). I was on Budesonide for 2 months without any changes at all.\\n\\nThey just switched me to Pentasa (along with Bentyl for cramping) but I'm having  such a difficult time. The Pentasa is making me EXTREMELY nauseous. I'm hoping that I get used to it and that will end.\\n\\nGood luck to you!\\nHey guys!!  Yay, more Crohn's people!!  Not that I'm happy we are all suffering, but it is good to know there are a few of us out there.  I have been on pentasa for about three months now and it is only now starting to work for me.  It appearently takes a very long time to become effective, so try not to get discouraged if it doesn't work right away.  Good luck to all!\",\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi everyone--love the boards, I always receive great feedback.  I posted earlier this month about being nervouse about having a colonoscopy.  I could not find the post so decided to post a new one.  I had a colonoscopy and an upper GI done--they diagnosed me with Crohns disease.  What is this exactly, what are the effects, dangers, treatment, etc.  Anyone with this diagnosis, please respond.  There is not much on the internet because I am researching, trust me.  I need to know real opinions.  I am only 27 and I thought that I was healthy.  How will this effect my life?  Thanks a bunch.\\nHi\\nI was diagnosed with Crohn's disease 15 years ago.  I have had it much longer than that but my doctor told me that being pregnant helped to mask the disease.  The first thing that you should do is to make sure that you have a good gastroenterologist.  Mine is the best! I am certainly lucky!  Three years ago my pain became so severe that I had to have surgery.  When the surgeon spoke to me after surgery he told me that he didn't even know how I was alive because my intestines were so scarred.  Since my surgery I have had very few problems with the disease.  I watch my diet and try to eat very healthy foods.  I will probably take medication for the rest of my life.  I also make sure that I see my gastro doctor every year.  He has told me that I have a 1 in 3 chance that my disease will never return, a 1 in 3 chance that it will return but I'll be able to tolerate it, or a 1 in 3 chance that it will come back and I will need surgery again.  Good luck to you!\\nHi I was diagnosed with crohns 3 years ago.  I had actually had problems since my teens but kept getting told it was in my head, ibs and so forth.  I even had a fistula and they still missed it.  Finally 2 years after the fistula they did a colonoscopy and found the crohns.  I'm doing pretty good right now on the meds imuran and asacol.  I can eat pretty much what I want although I have found tomato based sauces such as pasta sauce and pizza sauce really bother me so I try to avoid those.  What were the problems you were having to require a colonoscopy?\\n\\n\\nSorry to hear about the Crohns I was diagnosed about 8 months gao and it really has been hard on me and my family. I refused for many years to have a colonoscopy done and when the pain got too severe they discovered I have had Crohns for a min. of 5 years! So good for you for going! You should check out the Crohns and colitis foundation CCFA. They have a lot of information. You should also find out where your Crohns is asthis is very important in deciding treatment options and what to expect( Mine is in the terminal illeum) Remicade was great for 3 months but what most Docs dont tell you and I found very litle information on the net was that it can possibly casue scarring or strictures making surgery inevitable! (I was just out of the hospital last week for severe pains)Anyway hope this helps.It is also very important t have a good realtionship with your doc and ask a lot of questions becase ther are a lot of meds you can take. Oh and stay away from the Prednisone if you can . My experience was a TOTAL nightmare. Good luck!\\nSorry to hear about you being diagnosed with crohns disease.  I was diagnosed about 7 months ago.  I have been dealing with it for almost 13 years.  All of the doctors thought it was from a bowel reconstruction surgery that i had from a car accident so they figured it was adhesions.  I went through test after test and they ended up saying it was my gallbladder so they took that out, then they said it was my appendix so they took that out.  Then all the other tests i had done showed nothing wrong, but i was going to the restroom over 20 times each day.  Every doctor said it was probably my nerves and they said i was too young to have any major problems with my bowels.  I am only 24 now.  Finally in December i changed doctors and he referred me to a GI doctor who believed me and wanted to help.  They did an upper GI series with small bowel follow through and when i got the results they said i definately have crohns and that my intestines were very abnormal.  I had a colonoscopy done and he said i definately have crohns and i also had polyps that were removed and benign.\\n\\nThey started me on Asacol and it worked great, but the only problem was i could not remember to take it.  Taking 2 pills 3 times a day is hard when you are busy all the time.  So a couple of weeks ago they started me on Lialda which is a very new med just like Asacol but you only take it once a day.  So far its not working, but my dr said we could increase if needed.\\n\\nAnyway the major problem that i have is that i have to make sure i can get to a bathroom asap if needed.  It does change your life.  Its hard to work when your stomach hurts so bad and when you have to keep running to the restroom.\\n\\nIf you have any specific questions i can help you with let me know bec i have been dealing with this for almost 13 years now.\\n\\nGood luck!!!\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I have posted here before regarding my partner who has Ulcerative Colitis.\\n\\nI was wondering if anyone here has this disease, and can offer us any hope or advice.\\n\\nHe was diagnosed about 7 years ago, and has been suffering his first flare up for the last few months.\\n\\nThe only thing we can find that is different in his lifestyle since this flare up began is that he stopped smoking a few weeks before the flare up began.\\n\\nWe read up on the internet that the toxins absorbed by smoking works with the toxins causes by the colitis, they work together and somehow counteract eachother.\\n\\nHe went into hospital about 6 weeks ago, and was hours from losing his bowel, luckily the intravenous steroids started to work just in time.\\n\\nSince coming home, he is getting worse again, even though he is taking steroids still!\\n\\nWe have tried everything, Omega 3, Aloe Vera Juice, diet changes, etc etc .  I am sorry to say, as a last result he has started smoking again.  This is really sad, as neither of us wanted him to start again, but we are desperate for anything to stop the worst happening.\\n\\nBasically, is there anyone on these boards, who have had a flair up that doesn\\'t seem to go, and what advice if any can be given?\\n\\nThanks so much\\nHi Brook\\n\\nyes thats right the nicotine in the cigarettes cause some chemical reaction and can help some flare ups. Instead of him smoking why doesnt he use the nicotine replacement patches? In smoking it is the carbon that causes the cancer, the nicotine is the craving. Therefore if he uses the patches he is not getting the \"bad\" sides of the nicotine\\n\\nAlot of doctors now prescribe these to treat flare ups in UC.\\nHi Sharon\\n\\nThanks for your reply.  Yes we are considering the patches for the reason you mentioned.\\n\\nThe smoking hasn\\'t helped his symptoms as of yet! we are now today starting a fasting diet for him.\\n\\nHe was so close to losing his bowel last time he was in hospital, the steroids don\\'t seem to be doing much, everytime he decreases his dose, the symptoms get worse.\\n\\nHas anyone elses got any advice/\\n\\nThank you\\nHas the doctor tried him on AZATHIOPRINE???\\n\\nI was on this for ym flare of crohn\\'s and it is also used to treat bad flare ups in UC.\\n\\nIt is a powerful immunosuppressant and can work very well.\\nHi Sharon\\n\\nThanks again for your response.\\n\\nYes, I actually have that drug you were referring to, right in front of me.\\n\\nThe problem is, when we looked at the possible side effects, to be honest it scared us. they sound evil.\\n\\nWhat we have been doing is trying to find another way of putting him back into remission, in the hope of avoiding putting him on those drugs.\\n\\nHe is still on the maximum amount of steroids, and should be reducing them, but everytime he tries to reduce them, he gets much worse.  So at the present time he is on 8 steroids a day, taking omega 3, aloe vera juice, practically fasting on rice, bananas, and water, and smoking.  But he is not getting better.\\n\\nSo it looks like we are having to sum up the necessary of the two evils, and tomorrow he said he is going to start the drug in question.\\n\\nSharon, I have been looking at your threads, and see that you have really suffered yourself, my heart goes out to you\\nand I also hope your son doesn\\'t go on to develop chrons, hopefully he will grow out of it!\\n\\nDid the immune suppressant drugs cause you any side effects?\\n\\nThanks again\\nHi can anyone elses offer me any advice for my partner?\\n\\nWould really appreciate some answers - thanks\\nYou really should rethink this.Steriods, prendisone have terrible side effects. And long term use you almost always will have problems from taking it. AZATHIOPRINE is much better then having to take prendisone. Also by not getting this under control NOW your BF runs the risk of damage to the large bowel and ending up with a colostomy.Aggresive treatemnt is the best bet. I really feel he should start the AZATHIOPRINE. I have been on it for years and not any problems. But the steriod use has left me with bone loss. Adrenal gland function problems.Down the road the bone loss wil probably mean hip knee replacement. Bone fractures ,arthritus.\\nAlso Aleo Vere Is never used with Colitis or Crohns. Yes possible the Aloe Vere will short term make you feel better. Its topical meaning the outer layer of bowel maybe soothed making you think your getting better. But in reality the Colitis goes deep into the bowel wall.The Aloe does nothing for that.\\nSo it gives you a short time of feeling better when really damage is being done your not aware of it. And you would seek medical help later instead of sooner. Its like putting a band aid on a bone deep cut.\\nHi garden and cats\\n\\nthanks for your reply.  As I said to Sharon we were to trying to avoid going onto the Azathioprine, because of the horrid side effects that were listed.\\n\\nWe knew that if nothing else put him into remission then that would be our last resort.\\n\\nHe has now been taking Azathioprine for three days now, but still has to carry on with his steroids and Asacol.\\n\\nWhen we researched about diet and natural things to help with pushing him back into remission, Aloe vera juice was mentioned as being soothing for the bowel, and helpful for colitis.  We have been willing to try absolutely anything, he has even started to smoke again.\\n\\nHe left hospital several weeks ago, and he is under close supervision with the hospital.\\n\\nWe have been told that Azathioprine can take anything upto 12 weeks to work, which is a bit worrying.\\n\\nThanks for your input.\\nYes the Azathioprine does take up to 3months to really start working .Thats why he should start it while on the prendisone. The prendisone will help with the flair untill the Azathioprine kicks in\\nHi,\\n\\nI was diagnosed with UC back in November, I spent some time on Hospital where they started giving me prendisone, IV while I was in Hospital and then in pill form when I left, in addition I was put on a course of Azathioprine. I was also concerned of the potential side effects and the length of time it takes to make a difference. My steriod dose was decreased over 3 months and I had no ill effect from totally coming off the Prendisone. I am also pleased to say that the Azathioprine has done a good job at keeping the UC at bay. The trouble with this disease is that everyone seems to react differently, and there are risks associated with all of the medication that the the Doctors can offer you.. It can be a case of weighing up the pros and cons.\\n\\nI wish you all the best.',\n",

       " {'post': 'I was just recently diagnosed with Crohn\\'s disease. One of the medications that they have me on is prednisone. I was wondering what the side effects are. I have heard that it might cause a  puffy appearance to the face and mayeb some acne. I am really worried about having a \"puffy\" face, so if anyone here takes prednisone, has taken it in the past, or knows someone who is one it, please please please tell me what you know.. I dont want to look nasty with a puffy face. By the way I\\'m 14.\\n\\n-Madeline\\n\\n\\n\\nHi Madeline! I\\'m sorry to hear that you have Crohn\\'s Disease. That\\'s NO fun. I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis (also a form of IBD). I\\'m 14 too. I was put on prednisone, a total of...6 times in the past year. Whenever I was put on a really high dosage to control my \\'flare-ups\\', I would get some acne on my face. It wasn\\'t that bad though. I also would get mood swings. I could really be a real witch at times, but people excused it because they knew it was the medicine. I also got the \\'jitters\\' a lot, and had trouble sleeping. Right now I\\'m \\'weaning\\' off prednisone. I\\'m on 20 mg and going down, yeh! I\\'m having to take it in the morning since I couldn\\'t sleep at nights from the \\'jitters\\'. When I first started taking it I got really worried about the puffy face too. However, it\\'s really easy to manage. Just watch your salt intake. Try to cut down on the amount of salt you eat in foods, like potato chips and pretzels. When ever I would get the puffiness (which really isn\\'t that bad), I\\'d just drink a lot of water. It goes away once you drink the water. I never found prednisone to actually help with my IBD, but apparently it has, because now (I just had my 3rd colonoscopy/enodoscopy done) and it turns out I\\'m doing REALLY well. So there is hope. Good luck! And really don\\'t be scared about taking prednisone, the side effects (at least for me) weren\\'t bad at all and about 2 weeks after you\\'re done taking the steriod, the side effects go away, no puffy face, no acne. It\\'s all gone once you\\'re done. So, hang in there!!!\\n\\n-Carlie\\nCarlie-\\nThank you SOOOOO much! That was the most encouraging reply that I have gotten. I went to a website today about teens with crohn\\'s and everyone was so dicouraging, but you gave me hope! The only thing that really sucks is that I hated having the colonoscopy, and endoscopy (sp?) The prep for it was HORRIFIC, not being able to eat for 3 days and drinking that stuff that makes you throw up... and the cramps.. OH THE CRAMPS! I was hoping that I would only have to have it done once. I remember them putting me out (of course not \"all th way\" for whatever reasons they had) and I remember it really hurting too.. I guess I\\'ll just have to suck it up if I end up having ot get it done again.. but THANK you SO much for your reply!\\n-Madeline\\nMadeline,\\nI\\'m sorry to hear that you got some discouraging stuff. Sometimes people get really down when they find out the have IBD. It\\'s not a fun disease to have, and people can get embarrassed. Expecially at our age. Anyways, OMG, I\\'m right there with you. My first scope was horrible. Not only was I craving food so bad, but then you had to drink that stuff that made you sick as a dog. I figured \"Just get the test over with and you\\'ll be fine\", but then after the test I was even sicker. I was throwing up blood from the biopsies, hurting like you wouldn\\'t beleive, etc. But then the second scope I had went...better. This last one wasn\\'t too great. The day that I wasn\\'t allowed to eat was Halloween. Yeap! Of all days right? SO the whole time I was craving candy, but I pulled through and got wonderful news!!! It turns out that I\\'m doing really really well!!! I\\'m not in a flare-up and I feel pretty good!! So just goes to show that you can have good times too. And that\\'s what we have to remember. Living with IBD is tough, but it IS liveable. STAY STRONG HUN! You\\'re doin\\' great. Oh! And don\\'t worry about getting another scope. I had to have so many because of other reasons (lot of weight loss) but usually you just have to have a scope once every 2-5 years unless you\\'re having a lot of flare-ups.\\n\\n-Carlie\\nUnfortunately, Prednisolone is a steroid and although steroids reduce inflammation, they have lots of side effects, such as steroid induced acne and long-term use can create steroid induced diabetes.  That is the same reason that you are experiencing a puffy face.  This I am afraid is typical of steroids and is called a \\'Moon Face\\'.  You can also get an increase in appetite and can gain weight easily.  Sorry not to bring more good news, but try to get off them asap as soon as your tummy is a bit better.\\n\\nThere are more natural ways of reducing inflammation rather than steroids, but you would have to go and see an ND rather than an MD.\\nU guys have crohns?  What kind of symptoms did you have that brought it about?  let me know.  Thanks\\nPlutoren12,\\n\\nOne of the main things that made my family concerened about my health was that I have been underweight pretty much my entire life. Other symptoms were chronic diarea (I had it for like 4 or 5 months stragiht before the figured out what it was) Some rectal bleeding, a low grade fever usually at night, abdominal pain (usually after eating, but can be other times) and a pretty small appetite. MY family has also had a history of Crohn\\'s (My uncle had it)\\n\\nI response to everyone else, I guess I\\'m having good luck so far with prednisone! I havent experianced and side effects yet except I\\'m a little emotional, and my face gets flushed a lot.  But I only started at 40mg a day and every 2 weeks my Doctor is taking me down 10 mg, until I get down to 5mg a day, then I\\'ll stay at that. So it\\'s good i wont have to be on it for a long time!\\n\\n-Madeline\\nMy younger brother has had Crohn\\'s since he was 6 years old and is almost 16 now.  He has been on Prednisone basically at least once a year except for a couple of years in middle school when he didn\\'t get sick.  But he has gotten a flare up every single winter since he was in 1st grade and diagnosed with it.  Prednisone was what he was on a lot to control it.\\n\\nI guess I do have some words of encouragement.  As for the puffiness, when Mike was a little kid, like between the ages of 6 and 9, his face blew up to the point where it didn\\'t even look like him anymore.  Living with him day in and day out, we didn\\'t notice it as much.... But looking back at pictures from when he was younger and on the steroid, he didn\\'t even look like the same person.\\n\\nBut he was on this medication last year again, when he was 14/15 years old, and it did not cause him that moon face that he had as a little kid.  He also was not on as high of a dose, however, I think it is because he was older and his body took it better.\\n\\nWhen he\\'s not on Prednisone, and especially during a flare, his appetite is essentially non-existent.  He doesn\\'t enjoy eating at all.  On prednisone though, he used to wake my mom up at 6AM full of energy, starving for breakfast.  It alters his personality a little bit, in that his appetite basically triples and his energy is through the roof.\\n\\nYes, acne can be a side effect, and there may be others, just like any drug.  But just remember that this helps you\\nIt always got rid of his flares and helped him heal, and that\\'s what we all wanted for him.\\n\\nDon\\'t worry girl, you\\'ll be aight\\n\\nHi Madeline,\\n\\nI am 40 years of age and have had Crohn\\'s since I was 17 but only diagnosed 9 years ago.  It took a long time to find out what was wrong.  It is very hereditary as my 4 other brothers and sisters all have either Colitis or Crohn\\'s or both.  We all have different symptoms, mine was the most severe as I was the only one with pain.  I have been on Prednisone and a relatively new drug called Entocort (mild to moderate) and is a steroid.  It did not help.  The prednisone did help, I am overweight but did not get the moonface, everyone reacts different to meds.  I felt great on the prednisone but then I was on it too long and I have weak muscles and nerves and hopefully should go away.  Dont stay on Prednisone too long. As for the diahrea, get your doctor to prescribe Cholestyramine, it works, I take one pack a day, it takes like crap but it stops you (within 2 hours) from going contstantly and takes the cramps away.\\n\\nDont ever pick up smoking and alcohol, they irritate the  bowels more, avoid caffein as well.  Chew your food well and small quantities 5-6 times a day.  I have had surgery 8 years ago and was perfect up to about 2 years ago and now I need to have it done again.  I hope this helps, there will be a cure, think positive and good luck in the future.\\n\\nPenny\\nI have Crohn\\'s and I am on prednisone.  I didn\\'t get acne but I do have a puffy face \"chipmunk cheeks\" and my stomach is also bigger and puffy.  I was taking up to 120mg a day but I\\'m only on 10mg a day and next week I\\'ll be down to 5mg.  The prednisone has also made me pretty cranky and very irritable.  I guess it has helped the Crohn\\'s but I\\'ll be so happy to be off it.  I\\'ve also had increased hair growth.\\n\\n[This message has been edited by popsicle (edited 12-07-2002).]\\nI have now been on prednisone for 5 weeks, and i am feeling SOOO much better, and I have gained 10 lbs!!

None of the treatments have worked for me so far so they are trying the Remacaid Infusion Treatments.  I was wondering how they worked for you.  If they seemed to help at all.  If you felt a little more like yourself.  I have a beautiful daughter to take care of and I\\'m finding myself in the bathroom almost all day and very fatigued (falling asleep while playing with her) and very tense.  I\\'m hoping to hear some good stuff about this new treatment they are presenting to me.  I think I\\'m starting next week.  Hope all is going well with the control and treatment of your disease!  Thank you for your time.\\nRemicade was great I felt so much better. HOWEVER..... what doctors fail to tell you is that Remicade can cause scarring or strictures to form and the you may need surgery to relieve the area. I was just released from the hospital because of my stricture that caused and obstruction. I choose not to have the surgery for now and pted to have a balloon procedure. Talk to your Doctor about thsi. There really is very little info on the downside of remicade( which is why I decided to take it...)Good luck!\\nhi this is a good post im 15 years old and the doctors think i have some kind of IBD, i had a colonscopy done in may and they lost my biopsie results so now i have to go threw the colonscopy and a endoscopy again and it hurt so much last time im absolute dreading it! if anyone can give me some information about IBD i would appreciate it thanks',\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi everyone,\\n\\nI don't post here often, but I have been diagnosed with Crohn's disease in August of last year. For a whole year now, I have been dealing with my problem, and my first surgery involved draining of an anal abscess. I have dealt with the problem through Entocort up until January of 2007, when my surgeon and GI realized that the problem was not going away (infection kept reoccurring, and more rectal cleaning under anesthesia had to be done).\\n\\nSo we switched to remicade, and since Jan 07 I have had very little problems with infection and it has been working like a charm. Unfortunately, the abscess pocket is still not fully healed, and my surgeon needs to go in tomorrow and clean it out again, which does not worry be so much since I have been able to avoid surgery for over half a year now.\\n\\nOn Sunday, I will go in for my remicade infusion (last one was 2 months ago). I am hoping that both the procedure and the infusion will blast away the Crohn's for a while, but to keep the inflammation away, what do you guys think of fish oil? (Cod liver oil).\\n\\nIt was suggested to me from a naturopathic doctor, and I was wondering about the success rates you guys have experienced with it (for those who use it). Do you think I would have a better shot and keeping my Crohn's in remission with the fish oil? The remicade WILL do it's job, that's for certain, but I can't keep doing it forever, and my body might eventually start making anitbodies to make me resistant to remicade, which would be frightening. I need to find a way to stop relying on remicade.\\n\\nThank you for your help!!!!\\ni been on remicade for over a year,i take omega 3,6 ,9 ,any fish oils are\\ngreat for you ,take a good multivitamin from a heath food store that's\\niron free.i am in remission right now and i have not had any anal abscess\\nbut had to endure three rectal operations from it . if your remicade works\\nit will hopefully avoid any surgery and you should be fine,the side effects\\nare minimal for taking it in short periods of time.make sure your diet is\\nvery healthy and i take extra virgin Olivia oil cold press every day,no\\nbread or constipating foods,i found that heavy food is worse and eating\\nvery blended  or small amounts are better,weight loss is a big issue\\nwith crohn's and trying to gain is always a challenge.\\ngood luck\\nThank you for the response. I will continue with the fish oil since it has seemed to help you as well.\\n\\nI too am suffering a weight problem. At 21 years old, I was a complete stick when I was diagnosed with Crohns... approximately 110 lbs. I was weak, and had little energy to do anything.\\n\\nAfter eating a lot and lifting weights + brisk walking I have been able to gain 40 lbs in the last year and have arrived at a decently healthy weight of 150 at 22. I am still trying to gain of course, but there is no hurry now that I am closer to a normal 22 year old. I want to start lifting heavy in a gym sometime but I am still quite self-conscious due to the fact that I would certainly not be able to perform well for my first couple of visits. That is why I am doing exercises in the house or outside (walking or jogging) until I am energetic and strong enough to do something a little more demanding.\\nI was diagnosed with Crohn's disease almost 3 years ago but had symptoms for about 6 years total.  I'm 5'7'' and normally weight 135 lbs.  About 2 years ago I was very surprised when my weight dropped to 110 lbs.  I really looked sick, but I really was trying to gain weight, eating about 6 meals a day.  It took several months but I was finally able to get back to my normal weight.  I was on Remicade for a short time but had an allergic reaction so they switched me to asacol, then entocort, tried Remicade again, and now Humira.  I have had a lot of issues since December 2006 and have been in the hospital quite often.  It turns out that I have 2 feet of strictures and it looks like surgery is now inevitable.  I read on another message board that Remicade has been known to cause that.  I'm not sure of the accuracy of that but it may be worth looking in to for those who are taking Remicade.  I have also been on Prednisone off and on for the past 3 years.  I never gained weight until March of this year.  In a 4 month period, I gained 50 pounds!  Talk about an emotional roller coaster.  I'm off the steroids now but I have yet to see any results.  Anyone else with me?\\n\\nHELP\\n\\nBrandi (F/27)\",\n",

I have lived with Crohn\\'s since approx. 1977.  I lost 60 lbs over a period between \\'77 and \\'83 trying to cure the disease with various \"natural\" remedies including so many diets I can\\'t count plus psychological counseling, acupuncture, hypnotism, \"Rolf-ing\", and other such nonsense.  I finally went on traditional cortizone treatments (10 mg daily)which gave me some minor relief, but cortizone is a terrible drug.  In 1983 I had three surgeries for agonizing rectal abscesses, fissures & a fistulaectomy that left my butt disfigured.  The pain went away and I discovered that antibiotics quieted my Crohn\\'s.  But I stayed on cortizone based on my doctor\\'s advice.  I finally went on a regime of erythromycine (250 mg) daily for about 6 months in the mid \\'90\\'s and it worked.  Because of the antibiotics my Crohn\\'s has been in remission for 10 years.  And I\\'ve been medicine-free for that entire time.  I\\'m now having a bout for the past couple months and I may need surgery again to repair an old stricture, but I feel positive that the worst is in the past.\\n\\nKeep trying to beat this disease.  Don\\'t give up.  I hope you can find the right combination to win.  I feel I did, even though I am still dealing with it daily.  It\\'s a horrible way to live.  But there are millions of people who do.\\n\\nI work for the gov\\'t.  I have a sedintary job, not like your husband\\'s.  I manage software development, so I have the opportunity to get to the toilet when I need.  But, I have an active avocation - I am collegiate men\\'s lacrosse referee and I have coached HS teams for over 30 years - all during the time of the worst part of my Crohn\\'s battle.  Exercise for me works.\\n\\nRegardless of what helps him, your husband needs your UNCONDITIONAL support.  I would not have made it without my wife.  She\\'s a physical therapist, so her training helped her deal with me and my lunacy.  During the depths of my disease, I was a terrible person to live with.  The pain was agonizing, but dealing with Crohn\\'s daily is a difficult task, even pain-free.\\n\\nI wish him well.\\n\\nHi. Our daughter in law has Crohn\\'s. It was very aggressive, and she underwent several surgeries, but she is now in remission. Throughout her ordeal, she continued to work. She owned her own beauty shop. Now she works for her family owned business. There are two pro football players who have Crohn\\'s, a pro golfer, President Eisenhouer had it. Shannon Dougherty, the actress has it, Hubert Humphry, Queen Elizabeth\\'s mother who lived to be 100, and many more famous people. Just to let you know that people with Crohn\\'s work in all different areas. I hope your husband does well. He will need lots of encouragement, and can look forward to the day he goes into remission. I hope I have given you some encouragement. God Bless both of you.\\n\\n',\n",

       " {'post': 'Please beware this is a graphic story of my experience after a Panproctocolectomy (the removal of the large bowel, rectum and anus).\\n\\nMy story so far…\\n\\nI first started with Crohn’s disease when I was sixteen. It started just as I was taking my GCSEs at school. I found this really hard and was off school most days with crippling pain. I was losing vast amounts of blood every time I passed a motion. I’d get cramps and bowel spasms all day long and was going to the toilet around twenty times a day. Sometimes I’d get caught short and mess myself. It completely cut me off from my social life. I didn’t go out anymore and thought of any excuse to avoid my friends.\\n\\nI went into hospital when I was sixteen for five weeks to have intensive steroid treatment along side TPN (Total Parental Nutrition, feeding through a vein directly into the body).\\n\\nI lost weight rapidly. I went from a healthy eleven stone to seven within weeks. Weight loss was really hard for me to deal with as I hated being skinny and weedy. I looked like a skeleton, just skin and bones.\\n\\nThe next few years were the same, a period of being well followed by a period of being unwell. The doctors tried everything from Immunosuppressants, steroids and Infliximab to specialist diet plans.\\n\\nIn March 2006 whilst out of remission I was told by my consultant that nothing more could be done for the part of my bowel that was inflamed with Crohn’s disease. No amount of steroids or Immunosuppressants could heal it. There was no other choice but surgery.\\n\\nAt twenty three the idea of surgery scared me. It was suggested that I’d have part of my bowel removed and a temporary illeostomy. After further investigations I was told I’d actually need permanent surgery. I’d need to have my large bowel, rectum and anus permanently removed and an illeostomy formed. From being told this to actually having it done was just three weeks. I don’t think it really hit me until after surgery just what a big change it would make to my life.\\n\\nAfter surgery I was in chronic pain. Throughout the night I lost pint after pint of blood. A nurse spotted the drainage bottles beside my bed were filling up rapidly. She alerted the doctors and they confirmed I’d gone into tachycardia. I didn’t have enough blood in my body to pump around all the organs. The doctors gave me five bags of blood over the next hour and a half. It helped and seemed to get me back on track. The same nurse contacted my father and told him I was critically ill. He came into hospital immediately and sat by my side. I don’t remember much of that night, apart from seeing my dad crying in the chair beside me, holding my hand and telling me he loved me. It’s something you wouldn’t wish upon anyone.\\n\\nThe next day I felt shooting pains all the way down my spine. I’d had an epidural put in place during my operation and it was in the wrong place so wasn’t as effective as they’d thought. The second was placed too high and had to be taken out because it started to affect my breathing. It took them four more attempts to get one in place that worked.\\n\\nWhilst the operation was successful there were many hurdles ahead. Four weeks after surgery as I was due to come home my stitches broke down and the contents of my bowel started spilling through. I had several fistulas that had worked their way to the surface. I had to stay in hospital for an extra month whilst they slowly healed themselves.\\n\\nWhilst all this was happening foul smelling blood started leaking from my back passage. I had a slow internal bleed and for some reason it wasn’t clotting and stopping. A sack of mucus was also pressing on the nerves at the bottom of my spine. I’ve never felt pain like it. Every time I stood up old stale blood would come pouring out down my legs. The only way to correct this was with another operation. This would involve undoing the stitches to my anus, cleaning out my insides then inserting a tube to drain away any excess fluid.\\n\\nI was put onto a PCA (patient controlled analgesia) pump. This administered a small dose of morphine every time I pressed a button. This seemed to be a lot more effective than the epidural in controlling my pain.\\n\\nThroughout this my fiancé stood by me and visited me everyday. She was my rock and without her I’m not so sure I’d have had such a positive outcome. For months she came home after work, got a tram, a train, a bus and a taxi just to visit me. I had my own room in hospital and every time she came thought the door I lit up inside. Just to see her face, her smile meant the world to me. Many times I asked myself if I should leave her as I knew deep down her deserved so much more. She stood by me through my darkest moments and that’s something I will never forget.\\n\\nSlowly everything healed up. I spent a total of five and a half months in hospital throughout 2006.\\n\\nJust before Christmas 2007 I was rushed back into hospital with gastroenteritis. I spent another two weeks in hospital on antibiotics and steroids. Just after Christmas I was rushed back in with gastroenteritis again, spending another few weeks in hospital.\\n\\nCurrently my Crohn’s has flared up again and it’s making me really nauseous. Last week I had an Infliximab infusion and I’m also taking a course of steroids. I really hope this settles it.\\n\\nI understand Crohn’s is for life and I’ll always have to live with it. It can affect any part of the digestive tract, from your mouth to your anus. I think having a positive outlook helps and I couldn’t be luckier to have my fiancé and understanding family and friends. Also I must praise all the health care professionals that have helped me along the way, from the doctors and consultants to the stoma care team and nurses. Every one of them has made a massive impact on my life. Having Crohn’s has defiantly made me a stronger person and I value my health more now than ever. I don’t know what the future holds but I can be safe in saying I’ll tackle it head on with everything I’ve got.\\n\\nA.W.',\n",

       " {'post': 'My son\\'s girlfriend has Crohn\\'s, and her Dr. is suggesting either Remicade for treatment, or he\\'s really leaning towards Humira (which I guess is still experimental for treatment of Crohn\\'s).  Both are extremely expensive, but after reading information on side effects of Remicade, they say it can\\'t be taken long term as they don\\'t know long term effects, and the Humira side effects sound pretty severe.  Is anyone familiar with either of those treatments for Crohn\\'s?  Thanks!\\n\\nHumira and Remacade are pretty intense drugs, usually used for the most severe crohn\\'s.  I have had crohns for about 4 years and I take pentasa, which is a mild moderate crohns drug...pentasa is in a family of drugs called mesalamines.  Above that is milder immune suppresive drugs that try to calm the inflammation, like imetrex and a few others.  If these don\\'t work they move on to the heavier immunosuppressents, like Humira and Remacade.  Usually, these are only used when the other drugs have not worked.  Hope this helped...ask anything else is you need.\\nThanks for the information.  Her Dr. is supposedly the best one we have here in the City we live, but after I read the side effects of both Humira and Remicade, it scares me to see her go on either.  But she hasn\\'t responded to the other treatments, I guess.  I\\'ll have to ask her if she\\'s tried the ones that you mentioned.  The Humira would be approx. $2000/mo, and $3000/mo for the Remicade!  That\\'s ridiculous, but the side effects, and that the Humira is experimental, is the thing that scares me.  Like I said, I\\'ll ask her if she\\'s tried the ones you mentioned.  Thanks again for the response.  I have IBS, but I sure don\\'t envy you dealing with the Crohn\\'s!\\ni have crohn\\'s and been on remicade and its ability to put crohn\\'s in\\nremission out way its side effects,been on it for about a year and i perfer\\nit over humira. i got good results after the second transfusion and my\\ntreatment is every 12 weeks  now and i am in remission. its expensive\\nbut it works and surgery is the only other option.if you doctor is already\\nindicating these drugs the other will not work and the most critical thing is\\nto not let your condition continue for a long period of time, it will get worse\\nand you will end up having more complications.the expense it high but the\\nobjective is worth it to me,hopefully i will keep me in total remission  so i could avoid any surgery.\\nThanks, Lodgen, for the info.  I know she\\'s already had about 1 1/2\\' of her intestine removed.  For some reason, I know the Dr. is really leaning towards the Humira, so she is, too.  From what I\\'d read, and I realize everybody reacts differently to medications and treatments, the Remacade sounded at least like more studies had been done on it, and that it had been used for treatment of Crohn\\'s, and that Humira is experimental.  You\\'re definitely right in the fact that the cost is worth it if the results are positive.  I\\'m happy that your Crohn\\'s is in remission, and I will pass this information on to her!  Prayers to you that yours stays in remission!\\n\\nHello! I recently joined and have read your messages. I thought my experiences and my future experiences would be helpful! I\\'m 35 and have had Crohn\\'s since 2003. In June of 2005, it became \\'active\\'. Since then i have been in the hospital 10 times, 1 major surgery for fistulas, abcess, and a little portion of diseased intestine removed in Nov of 2005. Also 2 or 3 \\'little surgeries\\' for fistulas and 1 surgery in August of 2006 to reverse the \\'bag\\'. My most recent surgery was May of 2007, where I had to have a hernia repaired. My experience with drugs, well believe me it has been an experience. For example, Asacol did nothing for me. Imuran gave me pancreatitis. Prednisone helped with the pain but left me 40 pounds heavier because of my increased hunger. So I was put on Remicade in October of 2005 however after six LONG months on that I developed \\'drug induced lupus\\' so I was real happy to get off that. Well, after that I was placed on Methotrexate (fall of 2006) which isn\\'t really helping. I am also on Lomotil and Pentasa. Well, i am starting on Humira on Monday. So this drug will hopefully help me! I am interested in hearing about anybody\\'s results, good or bad!\\nHi,\\n\\nI am looking to contact other patients who are taking Humira for Crohn\\'s. What are your common side effects?\\nHi\\nAlmost the same story as Lisa. I have crohns disease went through all the drugs, Pentasa did nothing, Sulphasalazine made me sick, Azathprione gave me acute pancreatitis, Went on Remicade and i went into remission, fantastic then i developed Drug induced Lupus with full blown clinical disease, so i am not allowed to have it again. I am having weekly injections of methotrexate which makes me ill and am being referred to a proffesor as my consultant does not know what to do next, I forgot to mention due to other health problems i am not considered fit for surgery so my choices are limited. From various literature available Drug induced Lupus from Remicade is extremely rare although it could cause a flare in a person already predisposed to it, albeit dormant. regards stephney\\nI have read about HUmira, and it seems like less is known about it than Remicade.\\n\\nI am starting on Remicade in two days. My doc says that I have Crohn\\'s that is limited to the rectum and anus, and he says Remicade is particularly effective in that area. He also says it has become more of a first line treatment than it used to be. I was concerned about the possible side effects, such as lymphoma, but my doc advised that they are finding people with Crohn\\'s are more susceptible to that anyway, and it may not be the Remicade that is causing it in studies where it was present.\\n\\nBTW - I tried 6-MP for 6 weeks and noticed no improvement. I am on Pentasa, and I don\\'t really see much benefit from that either. The only thing that has helped with the perineal problems seems to be Flagyl and Cipro, but my doc says that antibiotic treatments are dangerous if done over a long period of time.\\n\\nGood luck to you all!\\nHi Everyone, I hope it is okay that I am joining your conversation. I think this is a really good forum and I have appreciated what you all have been sharing. I really was in particular touched by Lisa1701\\'s entry about her treatment. I work for a communications firm, and our client is involved in Crohn\\'s research and awareness. I\\'ve been trying to pass along to them what I feel Crohn\\'s patients want most and what they need. So I have been reading the forums and attempting to gain perspective. But I really feel your opinions are more valid than mine.  Is there anything you would want me to share with them?\\nBest Regards,\\nTanya\\nHello everyone!  I have just started humira end of october 4 injections. Today i do my next two injections and then every other week.  Right now im on pentasa 3 times a day, sol medrol dropped today to 8mg, and the shots of humira.  The only side effect i got was being tired after the shots.  But it could also be the drop on the steriod my body trying to adjust to it.  This year i have been on and off predisone.  I have the hardest time getting off i flare every time and get sick.  Pentasa isnt strong enough to keep me in remission. I feel good right now i dont know if it still steriods or the shot.\\nHi there,\\n\\nI hope the new therapies work well for you.  One thing that I only found out about Pentasa when my wife was trying for baby was that it is a folate antagonist.  This means that it strips folate out of your body and you need to supplement it through diet (usually green leafy vegetables) and pills.\\n\\nBasically, an average person needs 400 micro-grammes of folate a day whilst someone trying for a baby who is on Pentasa needs up to 2milligrammes i.e. 5 times more!\\n\\nThis will also apply to people who are not trying for a baby.  They will need to increase their intake of folates.  They should consult their health professional to get a recommended dose.\\n\\nFolate is used by the body to synthesise amino-acids and DNA (the building blocks of the body).  A deficiency can cause megaloblastic anaemia.  The body uses folate to heal itself, therefore, it needs to be replaced if it is being \"stripped out\".  An appropriate level in your body will likely contribute positiviely to your management of your condition.\\n\\nAnyway, that\\'s enough for now.  I hope you find this information useful.',\n",

(age 42) He was hospitalized for 5 days on IV antibiotics, then rehospitalized from an abcess related to the diverticultis for another 5 days.  Then he developed a DVT at the IV site and was in for another 7 days.  He\\'s been home and feeling ok  on coumidan.  However, He has had 2 flare-ups of the diverticulitis--one in May and one in July.  He had a colonoscopy in late may and they could see where the infection had occured (apparently a 12\" section). He has an appt with our family Dr. next Fri and one with his gastro the following week.  The nurse at the gastro office said he may have to consider/discuss surgery with him.  Needless to say, I am a bit anxious about all of this.  I would appreciate any experiences.  Thank you.\\nRA\\nHI, My husband is 45 and just had colon resection done today.  Needless to say the operation went great.  The doctor has to take out a 6 ich section of the segmoid colon, reconnect the colon and put him back together.  The surgeon was excited and went very smoothly.  My husband and I were also very nervous.  But with his history the operation was necessary.  The prep before the operation is tough.  My husband is in alot of pain,  but that is to be expected.  The outcome is very good.  I will post more in the next couple of days.  Good Luck\\nHello dan-girls, I\\'m glad to see your husbands surgery went so well.  Were they able to do it laproscopic?  How long is he expected to be in the hospital?  And what is his recovery time likely to be?  My husband goes to his gastro dr. next week.  His regular doc says it\\'s pretty likely he\\'ll need surgery.  We are hoping he is able to put it off until winter.\\nPlease keep us posted on his progress and thank you for any answers to my many questions.\\nRhonda\\n\\nHI Rhonda,  My husband had one area cut.  I don\\'t think it was laproscopic.  The cut is from just below his belly buttom down.  He should be out of the hospital today or tommorow.  He will probably be out 4-6 weeks.  The first couple of days after the operation are bad.  I am not going to lie to you.  There is a lot of pain and gas.  When you husband goes in his appointment, ask a lot of questions.  The doctors want to do the operation when everything is nice and quiet.  My husband came out of the hospital with a low fiber diet and antibotics before the operation.   That is because they want the inflamation and the infection to be under control.  Let me know how your husbands appointment goes?\\nDebbie\\nHello Debbie,\\nThank you so much for the info.  I appreciate your honesty.  Was your husband able to come home today?  I hope his recuperation is going well.\\n\\nJim\\'s appt is for Thursday at 7:00 PM.  I\\'ll let you know how it goes.\\nRhonda\\nI\\'m 46 and  had  6 inches of colon removed in Oct. and dr. wasn\\'t able to put it back together. I had a temp. colostomy for 3 months, then everything was healthy enough to reconnect, tho it took 5 hours in the OR to do it. After two abdominal surgeries in 4 months...I\\'m a little jealous of your hubby. My incisions went from navel to pubic bone, and the incision for the ostomy, and a small one for the drain. I had an NG tube for days, a foley, and the IV site infilterated every 2 days. One night it took 5 nurses 12 stabs to get one started (they were going to put one in my foot!)  I\\'m disheartened to hear that your husband is still having bouts after the procedure. I wish him the best!!!\\nHi Rhonda,  Dan came home on Sunday.  Everyday is alittle better for him.  He still is in alittle pain.  But hopefully everything will be great in a few months.  Keep me posted on your husband\\'s condition?\\n\\nDebbie\\nHi, my name is Colleen. My husband had laporascopic surgery on July 5 to remove 12 inches of his sigmoid colon.  He has suffered with bouts of diverticulitis for about 9 years. Each episode was worse than the previous. So we finally decided to do the surgery. I was amazed that it could be done laporscopically. The surgery went very well. The doctor gave him an epidural which helped tremendously with the pain. One of the drugs in the epidural had a numbing effect which worked great. He still had some pain when moving around and getting out of bed, but it was bearable with the epidural. If anyone is having this surgery I would highly recommend the epidural. Ask the doctor BEFORE you have the surgery. Amazingly as it seems, my husband has had such a great recovery that he even returned to work  3 1/2 weeks after surgery and he does not have a sit down job! Hope this helps anyone. It is very scarey having surgery, but keeping positive thinking and prayer has helped us deal with this. Good luck on your husbands recovery. It gets better each day!!\\nHello Colleen and Debbie,\\nOur appt. with the gastro went well.  He does not need immediate surgery.  He does have diverticulosis through the entire colon, which apparently is rather unusual.  There is one section of it that tends to get infected.  Dr. suggested that we have a surgical consult.  He said there are excellent surgeons in our area, but in the Cleveland hospitals they are able to do the procedure laproscopically (sp?).  He will arrange to schedule that appt. once I\\'m sure where my insurance will cover.  (there is a possible change soon.)\\n\\nHe has been fine for about a month, but he is under the stress of worrying about when another attack will occur.  His drs. understand this and want him to feel comfortable with a sugeon, in case surgery is needed.  He prescribed antibiotics to keep on hand so they can be started right away.  They will monitor any other attacks and probably do an MRI or scan of some kind to pinpoint the diverticulitis.  He is still on coumidin (sp?), till at least the end of Sept.\\n\\nOverall, we feel very comfortable with this plan.  (He felt the nurse he talked to earlier was ready to book the ER for him next week!)  In the mean time, I\\'ve learned more than I ever wanted to know about the digestive system.\\n\\nI hope both of your husbands continue their good recovery.\\nRhonda',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi,\\n\\nMy daughter and I (and whole family) have been on an exhaustive journey through tummy troubles and I am wondering if anyone can relate or share experiences.\\n\\nShe is 4 years old and had salmonella poisoning this past August. We have no idea where she got this from. No one else was sick. She was hospitalized with bloody diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting, and doubled over abominable pain. A CT scan showed severe infectious colitis, and enlarged spleen, enlarged liver, and free fluid in her colon and gutter. Her stool had lots of wbc\\'s and was positive for salmonella. Her labs were all out of wack. She improved after 4 nights in the hospital and was sent home. She has since had probems with her stomach hurting. She complains of pain in her stomach just after eating every meal (right around her belly button) she usually poops (soft, not liquid diarrhea--pretty normal looking) and then seems to feel better. This happens 3 times a day. She is woken up at night by stomach pain sometimes. I have struggled with wondering if this is behavioral, or for real. Whe have been to the Dr. several times about it. Her labs are pretty normal now except elevated sed rate 15, and c-reactive protein 18. The stool is negative for salmonella. The GI dr. did a calprotectin level on her stool (supposedly an inflammatory test for the gut) and it was 1133 (normal is less than 50!!!) we had a colonoscopy and upper endoscopy on Monday that showed a lot of nodules in the colon and the duodenum was swollen and bumpy with an inability to see the veins. The Dr. said he thought it looked abnormal to his eye. He thought the colon and everywhere else looked ok. He took 20 biopsies from the esophagus down to the bottom. I forgot to mention my daughter has had chronic apthous mouth ulcers since she was a baby. You can always count on seeing at least one or 2 and sometimes up to 6 in her mouth at all times. The dr. is thinking celiac disease at this time. So.......biopsy results are in and it is definitly not celiac disease. No evidence at all. BUT her colon biopsies show inflammation as well as the terminal ileum. (where the dr. thought looked good) The area in the duodenum biopsied normal.\\n\\nCould this be inflammation from the Salmonella still 4 months after the fact?? Could this really be crohns?? The dr. said the biopsies are pointing to IBD__crohns but he is not 100% and doesn\\'t want to start meds or label her yet.  I am sick over this.\\n\\nWe have her scheduled for a small bowel follow through with barium and crohns antibody testing next week. I am just scared. She is such a happy little normal child and I hate to have all this on her shoulders at such a young age. Her other symptoms are 3 pound weight loss, and decreased appetite.  Thanks for reading this incredibly long thread. Any insight or similar experiences would be great. My Dr. is wonderful and I trust him and know he is doing everything possible, but the unknown is so hard to deal with!\\nThat\\'s very troubling, indeed.  As I mentioned earlier, I am active in the autism community (have an affected dd).  Many of the kids have the same symptoms as your dd, and the theorized cause is active infection in the gut, usually from measles virus from the MMR (biopsies have proven it.)  Most of the affected kids are put on gluten free/casein free diets which allows gut healing and often dramatic resolution of autistic symptoms.  BTW, if the salmonella triggered Celiac, it may be too soon for the blunting of the villi to be evident on the biopsy--she could still have Celiac.   Dietary enzymes, probiotics are also used and help, along with a product called Lauricidin.\\n\\nI understand your dd is neurotypical, but gutwise she sounds so familiar.  You might want to do some sniffing around online on the \"autistic gut\" or enteropathy.  Dr Arthur Krigsman out of NY and TX works extensively with the affected kids so reading up on his work may be useful as well.\\n\\nFrom one mom to another, I am so sorry your dd and your family is going through this.  I know how scary and hard something like this can be.  Please keep us posted and I\\'ll be thinking of you all.\\nBrocallie,\\n\\nThank you for the encouraging words and all the great information. I am sorry to hear about your daughter, it is great that you are so involved in the autistic community. I did research what you talked about previously. I think the wheat and gluten free diet could definitely benefit my daughter, and I may try it once we are done with all the diagnostic tests. She had more bloodwork drawn on Tuesday for crohns antibodies (ANSCA AND ASCA tests) and has a barium upper GI with small bowel follow through sceduled on Thursday the 27th. If that looks ok, the Dr. wants to do the video endoscopy pill. He is very suspicious of crohns now, but wants to be sure before labeling her as such. I guess her biopsies showed crohns characterisitics. I don\\'t know if I mentioned she is also allergic to eggs. The biopsy results were not allergy related though. Her pain comes and goes, and I just want to get to the bottom of it. I will probably start her on probiotics also. I am also concerned about it being early to test positive for celiac. She did have the celiac bloodwork panel, and that was also negative. Right now, I wish we were facing celiac and not crohns, but we will deal with whatever we are handed. I just want her better\\n. Thanks again for everything.\\n\\nKelley\\nHugs.  Hang in there.  I understand the helpless feeling of seeing your little one suffereing.  I also hope it\\'s celiac, but remember, she can still be gluten intolerant without the specific celiac antibody.  There is a lab in Dallas, called Enterolab that can do EXTENSIVE testing to help you determine the precise problem.   You can send in samples from anywhere for testing.\\n\\nGood luck.\\nI have no idea where you are located but Dr. Theodore Bayless @ John Hopkins Unversity is awesome in this area.  He saved my life.  I was actually misdiagnosed and treated with Crohns for 4 years and Dr. Bayless got to the bottom of the issues and diagnosed me when no one else could.  Good luck and I will lift your precious child up in prayer.\\nmy daughter was diagnosed with crohn\\'s in the summer she turned 12 in oct so i pray for your daughter but the doctor told me it is a good thingthat we caught it so earlier most of the time people don\\'t kow until they are older and by then they have more damage done it is hard my daughte takes 11 pills a day and ccould not have a lot of food like kids want no caffine no pizza no salsa no corn and other things we are sstill finding out  so good luck and let me know how the test goes i love the gi doctor that my daughter has he is so good\\n123dietdrpepper,\\n\\nThank you for the information. I actually live in Richmond Va, and I will probably seek another opinion from John Hopkins. I know they have a pediatric IBD research team there. If I may ask, what were you actually diagnoses with?\\n\\nJuuJuubug,\\n\\nI am so sorry you are also dealing with this. I am at the point now where I just want to find out what it is so we can make her feel better. I heard it is much more common in the pre-teen to teenage years. I am feeling lucky that if this is what it is, we have caught it early, and can watch her very carefully. I will add your daughter to my prayer lists also. This is so much for a little child to have to deal with. I love my GI dr. also, and he is being very careful because he doesn\\'t want to diagnose her and label her as crohns unless he is absolutely sure that is what it is. He doesn\\'t want to be wrong and then have her deal with the consequences of it long term (insurance wize) Thank you for your post. I hope your daughter stays well. Did you have the ansca and asca labwork done in California to confirm the diagnosis? (crohns antibody testing) What other tests pointed to crohns if you don\\'t mind me asking. Thanks so much. I am the type of person that does better the more info I have. Have a happy holiday.\\n\\nKelley\\nWow!  John Hopkins would be a great option for you.  Dr. Bayless saved my life.  I was in my early 20\\'s and 5\\'4\" and went down to 90 lbs.  I actually had endometroisis with involvement of the bowel and bladder.  It caused the bowel to adhere to the abdominal cavity.  Another doctor treated me for 4 years for Crohns and I did not get better.Now we know why - it helped being treated for the correct disease.  I pray that your son is properly diagnosed and does not in fact have this disease.\\nWell, I have an update on my daughter....Christmas eve day she had 8 episodes of bloody mucousy diarhea and severe stomach cramping. It came and went all day. I felt so bad for her, but selfishly did not want to take her to the ER and ruin her christmas. I fed her a very bland diet and rested her bowels. Christmas day she still had some pain on and off and more stools than usual. Thursday she had an upper GI with small bowel follow through. It was abnormal and showed thickened folds in the duodenum and inflammation in the terminal ileum. There results are consistent with her clinical picture and biopsy results of chrohns. To throw a loop in things...her ANSCA and ASCA crohns antibody testing from California came back positive but looked like more of an ulcerative colitis pattern. The Dr. has put her on Asulfidine 3 times daily and metronidazole. I have another appt in 2 weeks for blood tests and a full blown sit down talk with the GI specialist.\\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on dietary restrictions? The main things I should avoid for now? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks\\n\\nKelley\\ni hate to here about the test came back with what you was hoping not to her .You ask what test was ran on my daughter he did 3 different blood test at first 1 was to see  if she was allergric to gultin i thibk and the other 1 not to sure and the crohn\\'s and ulcerative colitis  so he ran the scope down and up her from that he could tell it was not ulcerative colitis and like you said your doctor wants to make sure what is is before he puts down crohns  our doctor told us the same thing so he did a biospoy of her intenstinse and it came back as crohns i live in alabama but he is a pred. gastr. doctor and a very good 1 we go back tomorrow 1/2/2008 for a check up so wish us luck and as for what she can eat my daughters doctor said we just have to do a trial and error nobody is the same .My daughter can not have caffine,corn pizza but she can eat cheese pizza who knows why ,she can not have spices like chilli ,tacos,  and steak sauce and we are still learning more so let me know how things go.Tomrrow when we go back i am going to ask about my daughters slepping cause she can not sleep not sure if it has anything to do with the medsshe is on or what but she won\\'t go to sleep until 4:00am sometimes and by then she is crying cause she is so tired goodluck and i will letyou know how things go tomorrow\\nJuujuubug,\\n\\nI hope your appt goes well. My doctor also tested for celiac disease (wheat and gluten allergy) We also had her allergy tested and found out that she is allergic to eggs. How long until the medication showed some improvement? I think my daughter is feeling better. I think she has a high tolerance to pain because she is so used to her tummy hurting all the time. The bloody diarhea has subsided, and she is going much less than before. Is your daughter in remission now? when she reaches remission, will she still have to be on medication to keep in remission? These are some of the questions I have. It is hard to keep on top of medicating her three times a day. I feel like I am always giving her something. Thanks for all the information. I feel so alone in this. My daughter is so young at 4 years old to have this that I worry about the long term effects with her. I am sure that 12 years old is a very difficult time to be diagnosed as well. Independence and pre-teen problems are hard enough without having to restructure your life around a chronic illness. I am glad that I found you and we can relate. Thanks again.\\n\\nKelley\\nKel\\n\\nThe appointment went good other then him having to give her meds. to sleeep cause she can\\'t sleep at all there are times she is up until 4:00am .We don\\'t go back until june so thats good we were going every4 weeks then 3 month  as for is she in remission i think so like you i am still learning about this disease but i think i am figuring it out because when i read that they would have flare ups i had no idea if i would know but believe me you will now when  she is having 1. So are they for sure that your daughter has crohns? If so what meds is she on my daaughter takes nexium for 1 week then prevacid  the next week she can\\'t stay on 1 all the time causeit does not work for her she takes asacol 2 tablets 3 times a day ,methscopolamine 2 tablets twice a day and at the beginning she was onpredinsone for only 10 days thank goodness i am also glaad that i have found someone we a child will this take care andkeep me posted.\\nHi Juujuubug,\\n\\nWell it sounds like her crohns is under control..that is good. My daughter is on metronidazol 3 times daily and azulfidine 3 times daily. She takes the liquid compounded form because she is so little. She definitly seems better after starting the medication. She is not stooling as much, and she is complaining very little about her tummy hurting now. I am relieved. Steroids are next if her bloodwork comes back bad on Tuesday. She definitly has IBD, thay are still sorting everything out now. Her bloodwork looked like more of an ulcerative colitis pattern, but her biopsies, upper GI, colonoscopy and endoscopy along with her clinical picture and the mouth sores she gets all look like crohns. She is being treated for crohns now. We have another appt Tuesday afternoon so I will know more then. I hope your daughter gets some much needed rest and stays in remission. Take care\\nKelley',\n",

       " {'post': 'Folks:\\n\\nI\\'m 38 years old, 20+ years with inflammatory bowel disease...initially type-undetermined...Crohn\\'s diagnosis for 10+ years.  Just had a colonoscopy and my doctor changed my diagnosis to Ulcerative Colitis.  Apparently, I have no visible signs of IBD activity at the time, but a biopsy from a small red patch came back positive for adenocarcinoma.\\n\\nMy GI suggests that I can get away with having a partial colectomy and having annual colonoscopies to detect any recurrences.  My surgeon (and a few other GIs) claim that total colectomy is the only answer due to the risk of recurrence.\\n\\nI\\'d much rather do the partial and retain normal body function.\\n\\nHas anyone in a similar situation heard of or had a partial??  How risky is this?\\n\\nAlso, if I do get stuck going with the total removal, one GI told me NOT to get reconnected with an internal pouch due to the risk of the IBD flaring within the pouch.  Ugh!\\n\\nAny experiences/thoughts?\\n\\nLast question...None of my doctors has mentioned seeing a hematologist/oncologist.  Did you see one before the surgery or only after the surgery?\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\n-- Steven\\nDisappointed to see 147 reads and no replies.  I ended up having a sub-total colectomy on May 11.  Just out of the hospital this evening.  Still waiting for the pathology reports.  The tumor was 4cm, but I\\'m not sure if this is considered small or large in the scope of things.\\nSo sorry you got no replies the first time. Maybe no one had a similar experience but we could have acknowledged your concern and given some support.\\n\\nI hope you are recovering well from the surgery. I guess you are now waiting to hear if you will need chemotherapy? Let us know what the outcome is of the path reports and if you will be needing further treatment. There are lots of people on this board who have been diagnosed and treated and are doing well, which will be encouraging for you.\\nHi Steven\\n\\nI have Crohns and Rectal cancer but did the chemo and radiation without any colon removal at this point.\\n\\nI am afraid if they find anymore, I have to have a full  colon removal.\\n\\nAre you feeling better?  The waiting game now is awful.  I have to wait till things heal to find out if the cancer is gone.\\n\\nGood Luck and let me know how your test results come out\\nHi Steven,\\n\\nI am 34 years old, and just had part of my ascending colon removed 2 weeks ago due to a 7 cm tumor that was found.  It was Stage II colon cancer.  I have recovered well from the surgery...bowels are working normal again.  I\\'m going back to work full-time after 2 1/2 weeks off.\\n\\nAt this time, I don\\'t know if I\\'ll be having any chemo treatments or not.  At first my oncologist said he wasn\\'t recommending any. He said he would do preventative chemo if I twisted his arm.  I am seeing him on Thurs. for another consultation.\\n\\nI\\'m just trying to take one day at a time.  All of this has been very overwhelming for me, and I\\'ve been on an emotional roller coaster since.\\n\\nI wish you the best.\\nDiane\\nWell, I\\'ve been feeling better than I expected after such a major surgery...until now.  I just got my pathology results and they weren\\'t what I wanted to hear:\\n- 4cm tumor extending through the bowel wall into the fatty tissue with two positive nodes\\n- Stage: T3N1MX\\n\\nMy surgeon setup an appointment for me with an oncologist, but they can\\'t see me until Monday at 5pm.  Is it reasonable to give a patient this kind of information and then make them wait 5 days for answers?  What are my survival chances?  I am really freaking out right now.  I\\'m also afraid to do too much research on the Internet as the first set of data that I found was a lot worse than I expected.\\n\\nHelp?\\n\\n-- Steven\\nThanks for the supportive posts.  Here\\'s an update...\\n\\nSo it turns out that the 4cm tumor extended through the bowel wall and into the fatty tissue.  Two out of 14 nodes were positive.  Thus far, the staging is T3N1Mx (IIIb) with 5-year survival odds of 60% without adjuvant chemo or 83% with FOLFOX4 adjuvant chemo (12 2-week cycles, 3 days of in-office infusion followed by 11 days of trickle with a chemo pump).  I\\'m hoping that my that my age (38) gives me slightly better odds than the charts.  I have a PET scan scheduled this week.  I\\'m hoping it hasn\\'t spread too far since my CEA levels are low and the CT scan was clear.\\n\\nMy physical recovery from surgery (sub-total colectomy leaving me 25 cm of colon) has been quite miraculous so far.  I progressed from ice chips to minimal clear liquids to unlimited clear liquids to full food in 3 days.  I was released the evening of the third day after my surgery.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the staging information has thrown me into emotional turmoil.  I can\\'t seem to keep my brain off of thoughts of death.  I\\'ll be calling my MD today to see if anti-depressants or anti-anxiety medicines might help me through this.  I also have an intake interview today for a cancer support group at the local Wellness Community Center.\\n\\nMy \"chemo teach\" is this week.  I\\'m not sure yet how long after my surgery they\\'ll wait to start my treatments.  I hope that they don\\'t wait too long as I\\'d really like to put all this behind me as quickly as possible and move on with life.  At this point, my oncologist is recommending that I go on long-term disability until I finish my treatments.  I am really nervous about going bonkers having nothing to keep my brain occupied.  If it weren\\'t for my partner, friends and family I wouldn\\'t have made it this far.\\n\\nThanks for listening.\\n\\n-- Steven\\nSteven, I have stage IV cancer and have had 10 chemo treatments thus far, with 2 to go. I, too, take Folfox. My treatment plan is as follows: I go every other week for about 3-1/2 hours for my chemo, plus Avastin. Then I go home with a pump for 48 hours and return to the oncologist\\'s office for pump removal. Chemo is grueling, there\\'s no way to sugar coat the facts, but you will make it through it. The time goes quicker than you probably think right now. My biggest problems after treatments are diarrhea and severe cramping which usually start shortly after the pump is removed. In 5 months I have only been physically ill once, and that was due to too much fresh vegetables while on chemo (I also have a colostomy). My sister came and made a delicious batch of stir-fry at that time which I couldn\\'t resist\\n\\n\\nKeep your chin up and remain close to those who love you.\\n\\nPam\\nI John 5:10\\n\\n\\nSteven, hopefully by now you have been able to hook up with your oncologist. Please let us know what he had to say.\\n\\nPam\\nI John 5:10\\n\\n\\nPammySue51: Thanks for the tip.  I love stir-fry, but I\\'ll stay away from it for a while.  I tried a salad the other day and things didn\\'t go so well.  At surgery + 2 weeks,  I thought it might be safe, but I now know that my food transit time can be under an hour.  ;-)\\n\\nMost importantly, my gastroenterologist put me on Lorazepam and it is a wonder-drug.  I am no longer obsessing about horrible thoughts and am actually doing almost normal things (went out for dinner with friends etc.)  During my chemo-teach, the oncology nurse upped my dosage of Lorazepam for the first 5 days of each chemo cycle as it seems to have the added side-effect of helping with the nausea (BONUS!).\\n\\nI\\'m having a \"port\" installed on June 7.  Initially, I wasn\\'t too concerned about this because the doctor said I wouldn\\'t even feel it once it was in, but at my first group support meeting, one of the ladies was complaining that her port was really hurting her.  As they say, everyone\\'s experience is different.  I\\'m hoping mine won\\'t be too troublesome.\\n\\nThey\\'ll be starting my first treatment on June 18.  If all goes well, I\\'m hoping to finish my last cycle the week after Thanksgiving and then take my partner to Disneyworld as a celebratory vacation.  Note: Whereas before, I couldn\\'t see past the chemo treatments, with the Lorazepam I am now making plans beyond the treatments.  The realization that there is life after cancer is quite inspiring.\\n\\nI think my biggest concern about the chemo is the neuropathy.  I\\'m either used to the other symptoms (due to my 20+ years with Crohn\\'s/Ulcerative Colitis) or they\\'re only temporary.  Several of the people in my group mention that neuropathy is more common and more permanent than the oncologist let on.  They STRONGLY recommend acupuncture at least once for each chemo cycle.  Apparently the acupuncture helps mitigate the neuropathy.  While I\\'ve never tried acupuncture and I\\'m not sure I believe in it, I\\'ll give it a try.\\n\\nI had my first PET scan yesterday.  Previously, my CT scan was clear and my CEA levels were low.  All I can do now is pray that the PET doesn\\'t show anything.  I have a CD with the images already, but no one has read them yet.  I\\'m afraid to look at them myself as I\\'m sure I\\'ll find something to terrorize myself with that will actually turn out benign.\\n\\nFinally, I have to say that I\\'m finding supportive friends and family a huge help.  I\\'ve been sending out weekly status emails to my distribution list of friends and family (nearly 100 members) across the country.  Each week, I get dozens of replies.  When I\\'m having a difficult night sleeping and everyone else is asleep, I open these responses and read them over and over.  Seeing all the support has a calming effect that gets me through the night.  Since they\\'re in email, I have access to them whenever I need.  These emails have also been a huge help in lining up people to help with the practical issues (e.g., food delivery after treatment, rides to/from certain appointments etc.)  I\\'ve found that many people want to provide assistance, they just don\\'t know what to do.  By letting people know what my needs are through these emails, I get all the volunteers that I need often from people that I wouldn\\'t have thought of asking outright (like out-of-state friends shipping frozen turkey meatballs from Texas to California!).  I\\'m also quite happy that it looks like I won\\'t have to lean too heavily on any one person.\\n\\nSo, things are looking a little brighter this week.  I hope someone else finds something useful in this post and that everyone has a nice holiday weekend.  My partner\\'s mother is visiting us this weekend from Rhode Island, so I\\'ve got ample distraction to keep me busy for the next couple days.\\n\\nPeace to you all this weekend.\\n\\n-- Steven\\nSteven\\n\\nI have had my port since March.  It has hurt for 3 straight months.  It is now starting to be a little more comfortable.\\n\\nI hate it and  you will always know it is there.  Trust me\\n\\nGood Luc\\nOh, why did you have to say salad? I haven\\'t had a salad since last August. When I see my husband eating one or see a salad commercial on tv I could just scream. Right now I\\'m thinking of spinach salad (we call it Betty\\'s salad here in Ohio) and chef\\'s salad, among myriad other salads.\\nYes, there will be foods you will miss and, unfortunately, a lot of them are fresh fruits and vegetables which we need so desperately. Do you have a colostomy?\\n\\nAs far as the port goes, in my opinion it\\'s worth it so they don\\'t have to try to find a vein every time you go in for treatment. Mine wasn\\'t uncomfortable at all until I lost a ton of weight during my very lengthy stay in the hospital for the flesh-eating bacteria last fall. After that long (7 week) stay, needless to say my veins were shot. Hopefully, after chemo I won\\'t have to still go in for Avastin and they can take it out. Mine doesn\\'t hurt at all, but hits me right in the bra line which is an annoyance.\\n\\nIn addition, I don\\'t suffer from too much neuropathy. Shortly after treatment my hands and feet feel tingly for a couple of days, but that\\'s about it. I\\'ve been blessed as I know a lot of people have neuropathy.\\n\\nSupport of friends and family is truly a blessing! Having food delivered is a blessing, too. Just be sure it\\'s stuff you can eat. When I get diarrhea I have to stay away from the dairy products and fried foods. I sure miss cheesy-type casseroles then. However, I always have my home-made chicken noodle soup in the freezer (I make it before chemo and freeze in single serving zip-loc or glad containers) which I eat during those times. Which reminds me, I gotta send hubby to the store for ingredients for my next batch. Gotta have it made by Wednesday, as I do not feel like cooking while I am on the pump.\\n\\nSounds like you have gotten over the initial shock and your spirits are lifting. That is good, as a positive attitude goes a long way in treating this hideous disease. I very rarely even think about my cancer, truly. Maybe that\\'s good...maybe not so good...but our God is much much bigger than cancer! I realize a lot of people aren\\'t into religion and I really don\\'t want to offend anyone on here...that\\'s just my opinion. What I do know is that He saved me from a sure death in September and I am miraculously walking, and that\\'s good enough for me!\\n\\nHave a wonderful Memorial Day weekend.\\n\\nPam\\n\\n\\nI John 5:10\\nFirst of all, great news!  My oncologist just called.  They read my first PET scan.  It was perfectly clear.  So, this confirms my \"odds\" and means that we\\'re working towards cure as opposed to management.  So now I\\'m T3N1M0.  WooHoo!!\\n\\nCrohnie:  I\\'m so sorry to hear that you\\'re having difficulties with your port.  I\\'m curious what your doctor says about it?  Do they ever move/adjust the port if someone is having difficulties with it?  I\\'ve met some people who have the port in their shoulder/chest and others who have it in their arm.  I wonder if one is less problematic than the other.\\n\\nPammySue:  Before all this, my partner and I had a huge salad for dinner probably 4 times a week.  I do miss it.  Surprising since I\\'m originally from the midwest (Chicago) where I was raised primarily on \"meat \\'n potatoes\".\\n\\nI don\\'t have a colostomy.  Because of my ulcerative colitis, several doctors recommended taking out my entire colon and giving me a bag.  At the time, I really didn\\'t want it.  I was afraid of the impact it would have on my life.  My Gastroenterologist, however, felt that it was reasonable to do a partial.  They left me 25cm of colon and attached my small intestine to the remainder.  After the surgery when I found out it was Stage III, I felt really silly worrying about the bag.  Now that my PET was clear, though, I might come out the other end of this whole thing almost normal (not that I was normal before :-)\\n\\nI guess I have a few questions for my surgeon about the port and its placement.  Fortunately, I don\\'t have to worry about bra-lines as I\\'m not into drag.\\n\\nCompletely agree about the importance of family and friends in getting through this.  My family feels quite strongly about religion (raised Jewish), but I\\'m personally not too keen on organized religion.  Being gay, I\\'ve seen too many families broken apart due to religious beliefs.  I do, however, consider myself spiritual.  I am very blessed to have a very loving, loyal, and supportive partner and the support of both of our families.  I respect anyone\\'s beliefs as long as they respect mine in return.  I only wish that the feds would recognize our relationship as it would make things much easier with respect to health insurance and avoid very complex and expensive issues/taxes if something happens to me and my estate passes to my partner.  At 38, its a real dose of reality trying to learn the complexities of estate planning for unmarried couples and making sure that my partner doesn\\'t lose the house and will be ok.  (I\\'ll get off the soapbox now)\\n\\nAnyways, today is a great day for me.  I wish you all well.  I\\'m off to sit with my partner and my mother-in-(almost)-law in the yard.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\n-- Steven\\nSteven, that is good news indeed! You definitely have cause for celebration today\\n.\\n\\nI\\'m from the midwest, too, and I love my meat \\'n potatoes. Unfortunately, I also love my sweetcorn which is supposedly a no-no for people with a colostomy. My absolutely favorite dinner in late summer is a BLT with freshly-picked sweetcorn, with homemade strawberry shortcake for dessert. There are benefits to living in the midwest\\n.\\n\\nI\\'m glad you did not take offense by my religious comments. I hesitate to say those things sometimes because we all have different beliefs. I do understand what you said about families being broken apart, however. I have a good friend who is gay. His father literally disowned him years ago due to his (the father\\'s) religious (but not necessarily Christian) beliefs. How a father can do that, I don\\'t know, but I do know that Doug has to meet secretly with his mom. It\\'s very sad and it bothers him a lot. We have had many talks about it.\\n\\nOne thing is for certain -- we are definitely all united in this fight against the dreaded disease of cancer! Our job on this board is to give each other advice, lift each other up when we need it, and celebrate our victories in cancer whether they are large or small.\\n\\nAnyway, enjoy your Memorial Day weekend! I\\'m rooting for you!\\n\\nPam\\nSteven,\\n\\nMy mother is 81 and a 10 yr survivor.  She had the initial surgery to remove the tumor and part of her colon.  Two years later the tumor and cancer was everywhere, wrapped around the tube going to her kidney.  She has been canceer free for 10 yrs.  I know her \"feisty\" nature and her determination to survive plus her faith has sustained her.\\n\\nKeep fighting and the only other advice I have is find out who the absolute best is---and go to that person----the very very best!  THey all charge the same so you might as well have the best possible doc.\\n\\nI was just diagnosed w/ulcerative colitis---and had a biopsy done, waiting to hear the results but no cancer is suspected\\n\\nI\\'ll hope for your continued progress.',\n",

Her gastro is lowering the 6MP, her bone marrow biopsy was inconclusive, and I'm really worried for her.  Has anyone here with Crohn's/Colitis had medication-induced anemia?

       " {'post': \"I haven’t posted anything in a while since I have been on Pentasa and feeling better.\\nAbout a year ago I began to feel very dizzy, lightheaded and had major jaw pain. To make a long story short, I went to see a doctor today and he said that all my symptoms were due to Crohns. Even the neurological ones. I have never heard of that.\\nI believes the IBD can be treated with antiobiotics. He wants me to start Cipro and Metronidazole.\\nFrom what I understand this is not a very conventional way to treat Crohns. He believes that Pentasa is just calming the symptoms and that his approach will CURE Crohns.\\n\\nHas anyone heard of Crohns affecting your brain? And what about the treatment?\\nSounds a bit off to me.  My hubby has Chrons (I can never spell that!) and just went on Pentasa.  His GI dr did put him on Cipro but it was in an attempt to minimize an unpleasant issue with gas.  He hoped that it would decrease the amount of bacteria and hence the gas.  As for the neurolgical stuff--I might believe that IF you were having a great deal of trouble absobing enough nutrients from your food for optimal body and brain functioning but it would have to be pretty bad.  Are you suffering from malnutrition?  My husband takes a lot of vitamin and mineral supplements to help his body to get enough.  Ask your dr about this.  Anemia can sometimes result from Chrons as your body can't absorb enough and also may lose it from the disease.  Anemia, if it's marked enough, can definitely cause brain fog and a whole host of other unpleantries.\\n\\nhello:\\nYou are spot-on in questioning your doc- My son's CD came on him suddenly and he is now disabled from several surgeries that left him with severe nerve damage. He has an ileostomy that he says is better than the CD pain and misery. CD is a vicious insidious disease that can be manageable-or not. The Cipro and flagyl are good meds in your regimen for anaerobic infections in your bowel (or anywhere)...CD can appear in the mouth to the anus. Get a good dental check up just in case you have a nasty tooth infection you don't realize you have and if you haven't yet- get a thorough gi work up which will include bowel biopsies. Crohn's disease is an awful dust-devil of a disease than can turn into a hurricane.\\nBless you and best of luck.\\nCoffy\\nI recently had a colonoscopy and the dr. said he saw no evidence of crohn's, Thank God! I wondered if it is always visible in a colonoscopy or if it might not show without a biopsy. I wasn't concerned really until recently when I had unexplained mouth sores. I never get cold sores, and these were on the inside of the lips and gums.They seemed to go from one side, heal, and go to the other side. A year ago I had a temp colostomy due to diverticulits. I had always had self-diagnosed IBS, rapid gastric emptying.. and just thought it was normal for me. I wonder if all that time I had been having flare-ups of diverticulits or something else (crohn's?), or if the continual cramping, etc. caused the diverticuli to form. I asked the dr. once, but he didn't really get what I meant. Any thoughts?\\n\\nDid you have any tests to DX your Crohns?  I think I may have Crohns.....but all my tests are normal.....CTscan/sonogram and colonoscopy.\\n\\nCan you have early crohns and it be undetected?\\n\\nHope\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I am 28 years old and seem to have a great deal of intestinal problems.  About five years ago I was diagnosed with gastritis. Three years ago I was diagnosed with a back flow of bile in the stomach and seem to suffer from indigestion on a daily bases.  Over the past few years I seem to have developed problems with my lower intestinal track.  I noticed about two years ago I had a sharp pain in my lower left pelvic/abdominal area.  Sometimes the pain would last for 2 hour and other times up to 16 hours. The pain would come and go. Sometimes I can go weeks without any symptoms and other times I have pain for days and sometimes weeks. My Dr suspected it was female related so I had an ultrasound of my ovaries, the test came back negative.  I also had a smear test done to make sure there were no traces of blood in my bowels that also came back negative.  Within the mean time I noticed that I can go days without having a bowel movement.  When I do have a bowel movement I pass a lot of stool, but I donâ€™t always feel like my bowels are cleaned out. I still feel the desire to go several more times. I also have extreme gas pains and sometimes feel sick to my stomach.  Along with these symptoms comes extreme tiredness to the point I fall asleep at work along with having mood swings and being cold all the time.  I have tried to pinpoint what is causing my symptoms.   At first I thought it could be a result of being lactose intolerant but I take medicine so I can have diary.  The pills seem to be helping; I have been taking them for years without any problems.  I have tried changing my diet and ruling out foods that may cause irritation to my stomach and bowels.  Yesterday I went to the gastroenterologist.  I was very disappointed because I didnâ€™t feel like he listened to what I was telling him, he was in a big hurry.  He told me to eat nectivia and to have more fiber in my diet. I have to see him again in two months.  If the fiber doesnâ€™t help to regulate my bowels then he is testing me for Colitis and Crohnâ€™s Disease. YIKES! Iâ€™m afraid of finding out that my symptoms are the signs of a terrible disease.  I wish my Dr would step up to the plate more and help.  Often times I feel like my symptoms are being overlooked because Iâ€™m so young.  The worst part is no one had given me a blood test to check on my cell out.  Iâ€™m surprised that my Dr hasnâ€™t suggested one, it would help provide better insight to what is going on in my body.  The way I feel has affected my entire life and Iâ€™m tied of feeling this way.\\n\\nHas anyone else ever experienced these kind of symptoms? I know what I described mimics many things but Iâ€™m just trying to rule out Crohnâ€™s Disease.\\n\\nHi,\\n\\nI hope I can be of assistance.  First, let me say that I find Doctors the most annoying non-listeners in the world.  Since insurance companies pay them very little to listen to your problems they pay little attention if your problem is even slightly complex.  I have had IBS for many years and have been seeing a gastro since the age of 30 which was 35years ago...periodic colonoscopies and endoscopies were all fine and continue to be fine.  In April 2007 I started having funny pains on the lower left which can along with some bloating, very little cramping [if any] and incrase periods of loose stools.  My doctor had also said, eat fiber! and of course that always included salads and veggies.  When these new sensations turned into little pains I had two CAT scans done.  The CAT scans showed inflamed intestines, both small and large.  I was put on Flagyl and Cipro antibiotics and sent home from the hospital after a six hour stay.  Two weeks later my stools were rather terrible, no blood but dark, smelly, watery, with an odd greenish floating part.  My gastro sent me for a stool culture abd sure enough it was an advanced C-Diff infection.  Immediately off the CIPRO! On flagyl for 3 weeks until it cleared up!  A colonoscopy showed nothing! until the gastro decided to enter the small intestine, which is normally not done since the probe is larger then the intestine.  Sure enough he found Crohns.  What to do?\\n1. NO FIBEROUS FOODS, NO SALAD, NO WHOLE GRAINS, NO DAIRY.......\\n2. LOTS OF SOFT MUSH FOODS\\n3. LOTS OF FLUIDS WITHOUT ANY ACID! NO JUICE, NO CARBONATED DRINKS\\n4. NO FATS [PURE HELL FOR A STEAK AND POTATO MAN!]\\n5. ANYTHING THAT CAN PRODUCE SOFT BULK SUCH AS METAMUCIL [DO NOT OVERDO OR ELSE BLOCKAGES CAN HAPPEN]\\n6. NO ANTIBIOTICS UNLESS REALLY NEEDED.  NO MORE DOCTORS SAYING LETS PUT YOU ON\\n#$%^ AS A PRECAUTION.\\nSince changing my diet I have been much more normal.  I am trying to stop the Prilosec/Nexium addiction that the gastro gave me over the past 20 years. Very hard to do since the GI system linings have become used to no acid!  The acid is required for good nutrition absorbion!\\n\\nI hope you can locate a gastro who listens, performs the correct tests, and is a good diagnostician.  Rare and far between but worth a million!\\n\\nGood Luck\\n\\n\\n\\nmzsuri- what you described is exactly what i have been experincing for the past 5 years.. except since the beginning of this year is when it has progressed to the point where i can not eat a normal diet without \"indigestion\" supposedly the bile backing up into my stomach...\\nwe are both so young.. i am only 17... and i am just so desperate to figure out what is wrong with me and to FIX it!! when i read your post, it was as if i wrote it.. please if you find anything about your condition, let me know!!!!\\nCrohns and Colitis can be ruled out or diagnosed by a colonscopy / endoscopy there are no other ways to find out without them having a good look. If you have Colitis then changing your diet will not make a difference i\\'m afraid if you have a flare-up anything that passes through the effected area will irritate the bowel.\\nGo back to your GP and try rush the next appt or request an earlier one sometimes they can do it. It took 7 months before i was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis and i was only 18 when the symptons started. I have seriously had to change my lifestyle, but i\\'m coping! Good luck\\ni have exacly the same symptoms where as im only 15! ive had them for about a year and a bit now and all blood tests point to chrons disease\\nthey did a colonoscopy and saw inflammation but biopsies said nothing? waiting to have pill camera capsule test in about two week! hope you ok! let me no if you find anything out.\\nI was diagnosed with Crohn\\'s disease when i was 15, and have been very ill periodically. Sure, it\\'s a horrible disease that i wish upon no-one and when I\\'m sick I hate life and myself and my stomach. But there are different levels to it as well! I personally have improved a lot by excluding dairy and wheat from my diet. It complicates things, but it\\'s possible (and worth it!!). It IS possible to enjoy life even with a chronic illness. You don\\'t have to BE your illness.\\nI hope it\\'s not \"something worse\" and that you find some answers soon!\\nHey there Chrons-\\nDon\\'t want to piggy back on mzsuri but I have a quick question for you after reading your post. How did they see into your small intestine with a colonoscopy to find Chrons? I thought a colonoscopy couldn\\'t go that far? Or how did they diagnose your Chrons?\\n\\nDr. told me that he couldn\\'t see that part with the colonoscopy, and he suspects Chrons so I now have to do a barium swallow.\\n\\nThanks!',\n",

       " {'post': \"My daughter is 23.  Past three years complained of stomach pain.  To make this short, had endoscopy, colonoscopy, CT (2 times) and pillcam.  Ct shows circumferential wall thicening of distal terminal ileum, mildly prominent mesenteric lymph nodes in right lower quadrant of abd, 1.3 x 2.2 lymph node in right lower quarant mesentery, other lymph nodes smaller in size in same location, uterus moderate hetrogeneous.  Hyperplastic lymph nodes in ileocolic region, intra-abdominal demonstrates nonspecific adenopathy involving ileocolic portion of the messentry, incidental right ovary cyst.  Pillcam shows small polyp in distal small bowel, mild lymphoid hyperplasia in distal small bowel, medium size submucosal nodule in mid to distal small bowel, multiple aphthous ulcers throughout, Grade II esophagitis.  Hemoglobin and Hemacrotic is low, monocytes low, very high CRP - inflammatory, low carbon dixoide, the two test for possible crohn's came back negative and ANA lupus test came back negative.  She is hurting in stomach always, nauseated but does not vomit, no engery at all, lymph nodes in neck and under arm swell at times, not sore and not always, but swell up and down.  The doctor not sure if chron's or lymphoma or what.  Doctor seems concerned, but is taking her own sweet time.  She wants her to have a laparscopy.  Does this sound normal.  I can handle whatever is wrong with my daughter be it chron's, cancer or just inflammed, but something needs to get done.  She is not staying at college because she is so tired of feeling bad.  Do you think laparscopy is the right direction and why and when will they find out.  Any suggestions?\\nhey,\\ni would think that a biopsy of one of the nodes would be better than a laparoscopy. have you tried a different doctor or getting a second opinion? i think perhaps you should see your doctor again and if she is still 'taking her time' maybe go and see a different doctor.\\ntake care. i hope you get some answers\\nx\\nwould not a laparscopy being able to do that? I am confused.  What is a laparscopy?\\nA laparoscopy is key hole surgery. generally just to have a look unless they tell you otherwise. i would have thought they would tell you if they were going to be cutting chunks out of you as you'd have to sign permission. i may be wrong cause you're in the States but there is a difference in scotland.\\nWe have an appointment tuesday with a surgeon who specializes in colon.  I will be going to a different gastro after that appointment.  As I stated earlier, the doctor specifically referred me to a surgeon to have laparscopic exploratory and mentioned onocologist.  She stated they needed to check her lymphs and would be able to feel the small bowel that show multiple ulers, nodule, lymph hyperplasia and polyp.  Does this sound correct.  They can go in an biopsy lymph, then feel the small bowel?\\nLymphoma and Crohn's are very different.  The damage by each is different.  Lymphoma is a neoplasm that has grown in lymphocytes (white blood cells) and Crohn's is a disease of the immulogical system that can cause damage by secondary disorders such as arthritis.\\n\\nYes they can find out by doing laporscopic surgery.  They can take a lymph node at that time to send it off for biopsy.  They can take parts of other organs at the same time and do the same.  I have had so much surgery abdomanally and will tell you that they most likely want to do it this way so that they don't open her wide and leave a large scare.  Also if they open her fully if there is any major problem they are thinking of not allowing open air to the site.\\n\\nI hope that this turns out ok for your daughter and wish her the very best.\\n\\nShoshanna\",\n",

       " {'post': 'This site has been so helpful in helping me understand that even though I am new to all of this....I am certainly not alone!\\n\\nFirst, I am female, 36 years old.\\n\\nAbout 4 or 5 years ago I started losing alot of weight pretty rapidly.  Diarreah has always been around, about 5-7 times a day, but I never knew that it was a \"problem\".  People would tell me I \"looked sick\" or would ask if I was anemic.  I could only eat small portions at a time (like a kids meal) several times a day.\\n\\nIn October 2006, 3 months after my fourth child was born, I became very ill.  Unbelievably painful cramping in my lower abdomen on the right side.  I was hunched over in bed for about 8 hours.  I thought, Im just constipated, it will pass.  Then the nausea started...not long after, the vomiting began.....and would not stop.  When my husband came home from work, he rushed me to the er.\\n\\nThe next 10 hours consisted of x-rays, ct scans, lots of bloodwork, and finally being admitted for being \"very ill\".  I was confused....I was just constipated....  After 3 days, I was released with prescripts for flagyl, cipro and prednisone and instructions to see a GI.\\n\\nMy GI appointment was two weeks later.  It was a simple...\"this could be a number of things that are going on...\" (no real explanation) \"start taking pepcid ac once a day, an outrageous amount of Pentasa and start tapering off the prednisone\".\\n\\nDecember 2006, I am laid off from my job, insurance ends at the end of the month.  The same symptoms come back, and back to the hospital I go.  Ten days this time with daily x-rays and numerous ct scans.  Ulcerative colitis or Crohns Disease is suspected.  I was released on New Years Eve.  My colonoscopy is scheduled for mid January.  Due to lack of insurance, I did not go!  I intended on taking the medications still, but Pentasa turned out to be CRAZY expensive!  I continued on the prednisone for the next several months, then, carefully tapering myself off until I ran out of refills.\\n\\nOctober 2007,  cramping, nausea and vomiting came back and I find myself back in the hospital.  (I have a new job now, so new insurance, along with new hospital and new doctors).  I had my first colonoscopy and was told I had Crohns Disease, more specifically Crohns Ileum.  The doctors reconfirmed the diagnosis and location with a barium x-ray (upper GI screening).  I am finally sent home with new script for prednisone 60mg, Azathioprine 25mg (low dose due to infavorable blood screening), and Asacol-12 a day! (btw, the asacol comes out whole!)  I am also on a low fiber diet...basically, anything that is supposed to be \"good\" for your digestive system, is not good for mine!\\n\\nDecember 2007, the symptoms came back, again, so back to the ER.  I have now learned that if you tell them in triage that you have Crohns disease, they will take you much quicker!  GI believes the Azathioprine is too low of a dose but is hesitant to raise it due to my bloodwork showing I already have a low white blood cell and platelet count.  Its time now to decide on a new plan of attack...\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2008, I begin taking Humira.  Within 24 hours, I developed severe itching...all over...no rash, no difficulty breathing, just skin crawling itching.  Doctor believes it was a mild reaction to the large \"starter\" dose.  He prescribes anti-itch cream and pills.  The itching subsided in about 3-4 days.  I took my second dose, as prescribed, two weeks later.  No itching!!  I had the first \"normal\" BM in....who knows how many years!  I am very optimisitic!\\n\\nMarch 25, 2008, the pain in my abdomen has returned, severely!  The nausea is back.  The diarreah had been back for a couple weeks now, but not as often...but, today, nothing!  I went back to the er before the vomiting began.  The bloodwork could not confirm a flare up, but the x-ray showed a partial obstruction.  GI says it is now time for surgery to remove the damaged ileum.  Scar tissue has formed narrowing my small bowel.\\n\\nToday, I am anticipating my small bowel resection on April 22, 2008.  Thats how I ended up here.  Looking for everyone elses stories of trials and tribulations.  I wanted to find out from others how long their hospital stay was, how long it took them to recover, and when did they return to work.  Having had gall bladder surgery some 19 years ago, I can mostly remember the pain of sitting up, laying down, coughing, even breathing hurt!  I never wished that type of surgery on anyone, and now I find myself in a similar situation.  You dont realize how much you use your stomach muscles until you have an incision on them!  I am nervous, but not scared.  I am still the optimist though!  I look forward to being able to eat fruits and vegetables again!\\n\\nThank you to everyone who have posted their stories!  I think it truly helps everyone to \"compare\" notes and know they are not alone!\\nSurgery done now is so much better then years ago.I have had 3 bowel resections I also have Crohns. My 1st resection was done in 1977. My latest was done in 2001..And what a difference !  Pain control is so much better ..You will be offered the choice of having a epidural block put in . it numbs your stomache area and your really practically pain free.\\nIt doesn,t hurt or cause any problems you can walk with it as it does not numb your legs. You will also have a pump which you can push and receive pain meds through your IV line as you need it the first few days.  Sadly with crohns even with the best meds and care often in time you end up having to have a resection.\\nGood Luck with your up coming surgery.. The worrying is worse then the surgery !!!\\nI figured I\\'d bump this up since so many people are waiting on diagnosis of Crohns, this might help to compare notes!\\n\\nThank you Gardenandcats for the well wishes!  My surgery is less than a week away now!',\n",

He had some stomach issues this week and went to the gasto and he saw an ulcer in or by the pouch and is testing him for crohn\\'s.  It can just be pouchitis.  Did anyone here ever hear of someone having both diseases?  My husband is so nervous he can\\'t go to work.  Any advice/input would help.\\nUC and Crohn\\'s are very similar diseases.  Both are inflammatory disorders, but UC is only in the colon and Crohn\\'s can be anywhere from the mouth to the anus.  I\\'ve always thought them to be the same expect for the location, but I may be interpreting the information I am reading wrong.  I hope the paste below helps some.  I hope your husband gets well fast.\\n\\nFrom the Crohn\\'s and Colitis Foundation of America\\'s web site\\n\"Ulcerative colitis differs from another inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn\\'s disease. Crohn\\'s can affect any area of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including the small intestine and colon. Ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, affects only the colon. The inflammation involves the entire rectum and extends up the colon in a continuous manner. There are no areas of normal intestine between the areas of diseased intestine. In contrast, such so-called \"skip\" areas may occur in Crohn\\'s disease. Ulcerative colitis affects only the innermost lining of the colon, whereas Crohn\\'s disease can affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall.\"\\nthank you zoegirl.  I just wanted to know how common it is to have both.  I thought it was very rare to get both.\\nMy guess is he probably had Crohn\\'s all along.\\n\\nI just had an appt with a new Gastro and two years ago I was told I had crohn\\'s.. today he said it was more likely to be UC (tests were ordered).  UC is in the lining and Crohn\\'s can go all the way through the bowel wall.\\n\\nGood luck to your husband and your quest for answers!\\n\\nCheri\\nPlease get enterric coated fish oil capsules. Enterric coated omega 3 will sooth and heal the lesions. Heavy doses at first like 300 mg every 4 hours and do this for a number of days. As you feel better you can take a lot less. Finding the product is a bit hard but it is out there. It must be ENTERRIC coated.\\nmy daughteer was diagonised with crohn\\'s this aug she turn 12 in oct her gast.  doc did biopsas to see which 1 but when he did the colon scope he pretty much knew it was crohn good luck with your husband my daughter now has to take 11 pills a day good luck\\nI have known of a couple people on a different forum that have both diseases. It IS possible, but very rare.\\n\\nIt could also be Crohn\\'s colitis.\\n\\nZoeGirl: what tests did they do before to dx you with CD? Just wondering why they didn\\'t think UC before...\\nI just saw this post.\\nThey did a colonoscopy and by my symptoms treated me of Crohn\\'s.  I was better a couple of years before problems again.  Went to a new gastro who then suspected UC.  Turns out it wasn\\'t either.  My gallbladder wasn\\'t functioning so they removed it.  I had a rough recovery but I think I am finally getting better.\\n\\nOh and I also have some gastritis and \"non specific colitis\" but neither seem to bother me.\\nMy mom just had her gallbladder out. She feels much better, too. I don\\'t have any upper right pain, though.\\nI didn\\'t have any right sided pain either.  All lower abdominal and left side.\\nI am pretty confused. Hopefully soon I will get it figured out. I am pretty sure I do NOT have UC, so it\\'s just now the question of: do I have CD? A couple more tests & I should know for sure... hopefully...\\n\\nI was told that I didn\\'t have crohn\\'s with this new gastro because of a blood test available that didn\\'t show markers  ?  I guess they didn\\'t have it when I went a couple years ago.  So right off the bat they told me I didn\\'t have Crohn\\'s.  I had a tearing feeling and blood/mucus on my stools at first, but then it progressed to cramping that left me crying most days.. which is when they found the gallbladder.. they ordered a HIDA scan just for the heck of it... he didn\\'t even think that was the problem.  I\\'m still not 100% and we thought maybe I had something on top of the GB but I\\'m riding it out for a while.  I have discomfort but not pain, so as far as I am concerned I am feeling pretty well.\\n\\nI hope you feel better soon. Seems like you have many things going on at once!\\nI think that\\'s the problem. Too many symptoms, no one knows what is related to what.\\n\\nI am having the blood test, but I was told it was NOT 100%, so originally they didn\\'t want me to have it, due to cost. But now they are trying to figure it out so I guess I am going to have it. I did have colitis in my first scope, but this one seemed normal with no ulcers this time, so I am just waiting for the biopsies to come back to know for sure. She said I will take the blood test next if biopsies don\\'t show anything & we will go from there. She said it may just be a bacterial infection that made me really really sick. (for 10+ months!) But I had a small bowel follow through that showed inflammation, so who knows. I don\\'t know if a bacterial infection would show that as well? But right now I am just guessing.... I have to wait & see on this one.\\n\\nThen I have fluid in my ear & mastoid sinus that won\\'t go away. Constant muffled sounds & fluid moving sounds, popping & discomfort. I finally am going to an ENT to get rid of this.\\n\\nI also had ovarian cyst issues. Just had laproscopic surgery & hysteroscopy D&C 2 weeks ago. The big cyst was gone by then. All female parts look fine. But no explanation on why I had my period for 6 weeks... I am waiting on this one as well... I have to wait & see how this next period goes & if  I have constant bleeding again to see this pans out. If I still bleed, I will be leaning towards a thyroid issue.\\n\\nThen I have a rib that is subluxed where it connects to my spine. I have had this for months as well.

       " {'post': 'Hello to my fellow pain in the a-- friends on this board....\\n\\nI have been having problems for a while, since June. I am normally a constipated person, but since then have been going every day, sometimes up to 5 times a day. I have lost 45 lbs. This all began after a very severe kidney infection. I tested positive for a fecal occult blood test (hidden blood in the stool) and started to take notice & look at my stool after going. I noticed blood a few times, in the stool. It\\nto be difficult for me to go, constantly constipated, going maybe twice a week, so I thought everything was finally good with my bowels. When the doctors were thinking colon cancer (with all the weight loss & my brother being diagnosed at the same time with pancreatic cancer), I thought they were crazy. I thought I was going #2 very well! Well, I had a colonoscopy & EGD done at the same time (NEVER do thatâ€“I was sick for a week!!) & found that I ulcers & inflammation of my colon. The surgeon thought colitis. The biopsies came back \"focal active colitis\" with mild edema in the transverse/descending colon, and \"Focal Active Colitis\" with mild crypt distortion and mild edema in the rectum/sigmoid colon. I was told it would go away after a month on azulfidine. As soon as that month was over, I lost another 10 lbs. So they put me back on it. My osteo said he was thinking Crohn\\'s, some sort of IBD. I thought I had already been diagnosed! I am confused... Then my mom talked to her gastro about it & she thinks it\\'s Crohn\\'s, too. I couldn\\'t believe it when I got the script filled & I have 5 refills!!! Am I going to have to take this forever??? UGh...\\n\\nPlease respond if you have any info. I do NOT have diarrhea or anything, just weight loss & I feel like crap, tired & such. I also have pain in my left rib, but they think that is due to a rib out of joint, so not related.\\n\\nHow do they tell if it\\'s Crohn\\'s as opposed to Colitis? Can\\'t it just go away?\\ndid you find out yet?\\nNo I have not. I have to see a gastro, I haven\\'t yet. Everything is pointing to crohn\\'s....\\nHave they taken blood to test for Crohn\\'s?  There are markers now they can look for.  I was told I had Crohn\\'s two years ago but now told I don\\'t because I don\\'t carry the markers.\\n\\nMine is now thought to be gyn related.\\nNo, I haven\\'t. I haven\\'t been in to see the gastro yet. I have been pretty ill. Like I have the flu. I never had diarrhea before, not sure what is going on. I am really bloated too. Food not digesting... I see lettuce & stuff in the toilet. So gross, I know. Not sure what to do. I feel so ill, but I guess I have to wait for 2 weeks to see my pcp so I can get a referral to a gastro....\\n\\nI would love any suggestions or ideas... I am running out of gas on this...\\nForgot to mention... my doc changed my script from norco to darvocet due to the fact that the norco wasn\\'t digesting. It was showing up in my stool.\\n\\nNo, I don\\'t have diarrhea most of the time. Maybe because I am on narcotic pain meds that sometimes cause constipation??? I just had my pain meds switched to Darvocet & initially I had diarrhea for 2 days, but it has firmed up again. I emailed a gastro online who said it is important for me to see a gastro, I either have an enzyme problem or everything is moving too fast through the GI tract. He said not sure if I have Crohn\\'s or Colitis, but you CAN have an IBD such as UC or CD WITHOUT having diarrhea.\\n\\nI have also been having this yellow-transparent jelly like stuff (mucous?) in my stool. I also feel like I have to go constantly & have been having numerous BMs—sometimes 6+ times a day. I have seen small amounts of blood still.\\n\\nI am worried due to the dizziness & fatigue & black-outs (I am not sure if you would really call it a black out, it\\'s just where I can\\'t see for a few minutes, not where I really pass out or anything.) & such. I still have the palpitations, too.\\n\\nAny ideas?\\nWent to the GI yesterday. She said I have an IBD. Just not sure if it\\'s CD or UC. My WBC count has been high for the last few weeks & the GI said that was due to inflammation from the IBD.\\n\\nI have now lost 50 lbs. & have bouts of nausea & loose stools. I have had to reeive IV fluids a couple of times due to dehydration. Also had low potassium. I feel the urge for BMs constantly & have urgency in the morning so much that it will wake me up. I haven\\'t seen much blood lately, but have had it shown on my stool in the past, just not often & not that much.\\n\\nI had the small bowel follow through today. It was not fun. The barium moved through to my large bowel in 30 minutes, but there was a pool of it in my lower right side & they kept doing x-rays to see if it would move so they could get better pictures. The radiologist said it is still a toss up between UC & CD & that the small bowel didn\\'t look too bad. I am to call my GI in a couple of days to get the results. What makes the barium move through the bowels so fast?\\nZoeGirl: That is interesting because I have of late been having GYN problems & am being referred to an ob-gyn. I do have a couple ovarian cysts that they have been watching, but my GI said that my pain is NOT due to the cysts, but due to the IBD. She is SURE I have IBD, just not sure if it\\'s CD or UC. I go for another colonoscopy in 6 weeks. I had a small bowel series which showed what they believe is inflammation in the area of the cecum/ileum. This makes me believe that it is crohn\\'s but not for sure. My colonoscopy that was done in October did not look at the cecum/iluem or do a biopsy of that area (that\\'s why I have to have it done AGAIN.) So what were your gyn issues?\\n\\nMy GI did not think I should do the blood test due to the cost & the fact that it is not always accurate.\\nI have to have a colonoscopy to look for colitis, what is the procedure like? im dreading it\\n',\n",

The full prescribing info stated that Lymphoma occured in less than 5% of patients, but it's still an issue to me...

My doctor said once I start Humira, I will continue to take Pentasa and come off of Prednisone shortly after.\\n\\nI recently had my first fissure this past month.  I still have it and went to the doctor for it Monday.  He said once I get my Crohn's under control it will heal and prescribed two different ointments for it.\\n\\nIs it normal for all of these Crohn's related complications to happen in a matter of months?  Is it a sign that I will most likely require surgery later on?  It's in my small bowel and I am paranoid that I will die one day due to not having enough small bowel left if surgery starts.\",\n",

My only options then are to take prednisone or start smoking again. Been down the prednisone path many times and its side affects gave me osteonecrosis of the hips when I was 26. After 2 painful hip surgeries steroids are no longer an option for me. Now at 37 the urge to quit smoking is here again, I feel like Im doomed to smoke forever. Is there anyone else who has this problem?\\nOh my god...YES! I do not have colitis but i do have IBS. I quit on july 1 (4 months) ago and have been miserable ever since!

Put me on antibiotics for 10days which bothered me, but I am off them now.  Today I am having some acid reflux, I do not want even a mild case of colitis again.  What OTC did your doctor say would clean the colitis up.  If you find info at all let me know.\\nI just wanted to let you know my story.... I became sick a year ago after a kidney infection & 3 weeks of antibiotics.... I was losing weight like crazy. Tons of tests later, I had a hemoccult test which was positive. I had scopes in October which showed small ulcers. The biopsy said I had focal active colitis, mild colitis the doctors told me. I was put on azulfidine 500mg, 3 x a day. I went off it & began losing weight again. Another doctor said I needed to get back on it, so I did. A bit more weight was still lost, more tests ordered & I was sent to a GI. This GI said I probably had IBD, either ulcerative colitis or crohn\\'s disease. I had a small bowel follow thru which showed an area of concern, but no strictures or anything. I was put on 20mg of prednisone daily. When the time came for the c-scope by my new GI, nothing was found, although I am still having frequent stools. I was told that I have infectious colitis induced IBS. Possibly C. diff. But my stool cultures & tests are negative for c.diff now.\\n\\nHope that explains the type of colitis that you can have while not having ulcerative colitis. It is possible.\\nI can\\'t quite understand my diagnosis, either.  GE never mentioned \"ulcerative\" colitis, only colitis, period.\\n\\nWhen I 1st went about my lower abdomen, he agreed it sounded like it could be the C. Diff kind - which would be called pseudomembranous colitis.\\n\\nHowever, stools and biopsies said I don\\'t have C. Diff, so I was told \"colitis\", period.\\n\\nI didn\\'t think to ask if he meant the big deal of ulcerative or not, or if there is some other version.\\n\\nI could ask my uncle and aunt who are in medicine.\\nI would recommend getting all your medical records. That way you have the biopsy results & everything. You can get infectious colitis without it being c.diff that caused it by the way....\\nhukleberrie, are you still on the prednisone? and you say the \\'scope\\' showed ulcers.?\\nmy brother has/had?? ulcerative colitis , digestive problems since his 20\\'s, 20 years on the prednisone. he is now 53. the docs did not tell him  about the nasty side effects of the drug. he finally had the operation 10 yrs ago, and wished he had it years earlier, as he has finally gained weight, no longer rail thin, not on the prednisone. but must take medicine to rebuild his bone density as you lose bone mass from taking the steroid (prednisone). and supplement with calcium maybe so then stones become a problem so it is merry go round.  i encourage anyone on this medicine to grill their doctors about what this disease is, and about the prednisone. it also helps to get info from pharmacists, they are a good compliment to the doctors info.\\nas for \\'ulcers\\', i was told there are lesions or ulcers in the intestine which interfere with the body\\'s ability to absorb the nutrients, hence the weight loss and diarrhea.....********* has a pretty good description of all the inflammatory bowel diseases..i just typed in \\'Colitis\\'\\nI am not on prednisone. The uclers were found in October. (first scope) I took azulfidine for a couple months but began losing weight again. Saw the GI who then put me on prednisone also. I did realize the side effects but was looking for some relief. I was able to get off the prednisone after only 2 1/2 months.\\n\\nI have looked up all the different forms of colitis. After this last scope in April, the GI said I was all clear. NO colitis. Just IBS now. ???\\n\\nSo that is where I have left it. Now my doctor seems to think that fast transit time is my problem, so he has put me on amitripyline to slow me down, and hopefully help with my joint pain.\\nMy wife is currently going through a flare-up of her Colitis, since losing her father about three months ago, the stress brought it back.  Her GI doctor had put her on Endocort EC for two months and then had her come off the medication.  She is still having some problems of generally not feeling well and having some pain and nausea in her stomach.  The GI Doc thinks she may have IBS as well as the Colitis.\\n\\nHer Colitis was originally diagnosed two years ago when she got very ill, with diarrhea and throwing up at the same time.  The Doc did a Colonoscopy and fortunately had enough insight to do a biopsy when he was doing it.  Hers turned out to be Microscopic Colitis and could only be verified under a microscope.  It was diagnosed by the Pathologist here and also at the University of Washington Department of Medicine.  She was hospitalized four times in a two month period before they finally put her on IV Prednisone and she responded to that.  She was off work for three months with it.\\nI had biopsies with both c-scopes, the first one showed Focal Active Colitis, one with Mild Crypt Distortion (that I was originally told meant IBD), but now with the second scope, the GI said the biopsies came back clear. I have not seen the biopsy results with my own eyes to know for sure, but I do believe her.\\n\\nI actually have other health issues, that are leading me to believe I have HMS or EDS, and some forms of EDS have GI issues as well.\\n\\nAt this point, I am really not sure what my problem is. I am able to keep my weight up only by eating probably 3,000+ calories a day. (I have 2 candy bars, cinn rolls, ice cream, plus my regular meals to keep my weight just on the line of underweight, which looks skinny to my family. I haven\\'t been this thin since I was 14.)\\n\\nI am seeking advice from my pcp to see if he believes I should follow through with the EDS idea. I had contacted a professor with questions, and then he told me to contact another doctor at a teaching hospital near me, and she felt EDS was a possibly & I should be seen. I am just awaiting the decision from my doctor & I should receive my date for the appt. within a week or so.... more waiting....\\nI forgot to mention, the surgeon who did my first c-scope that showed small ulcers said he thought it \"looked like lymphocytic colitis\" but the biopsy came back focal active colitis. But now it\\'s IBS....\\nHave any if you had bone joint pain that hits and moves around?\\n\\nAlso does loose stools always come with the pain?

He has been suffering pain and frequent trips to the toilet for the past six months now.   He had investigative surgery last month and a biopsy of his lower bowel was taken. After the surgery we were told that he had Proctitis.  But we were given the results of the full biopsy yesterday as Ulcerative Colitis and and he is being transferred to our main Children's Hospital in Bristol to see a consultant, as a matter of urgency.  He is still bleeding daily and is still having to use the toilet frequently (numerous times a day).  We have been told that further tests will probably be carried out by the specialist to look further up into his bowel (?).  The general surgeon that we saw could not answer any more of our questions as it would be referred to the specialist who could enlighten us more to the condition and treatment etc.\\n\\nHowever, on googling UC (as you do!) I noticed that some other symptoms that he has had for some 18 months or so are attributed to UC (like skin rashes, eye problems etc).  Has anyone else developed any other symptoms of the eye or skin etc that relate to UC?\\n\\nI would really like to hear from anyone who has a child suffering from this as I was told by the consultant that it is quite rare in children of my son's age.

I too have a child with ulcerative colitis, although she's not so young anymore (21).  I'm posting a government site that I think will have helpful insight for you as well as some links to sound information:\\n[url]http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ulcerativecolitis.html[/url]\\n\\nMy daughter did not have the eye or skin problems of UC, but her attack came on very quickly and lasted 4 months.  She ultimately had her colon removed and now has an internal pouch called a j pouch.\\nHere is a governement link to information on extraintestinal manifestations of UC that might also be helpful to you:\\n[url]http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1925026[/url]\\n\\nMy only other words of advice right now would be to make sure you keep a running list of questions for your doctor so that you won't miss anything when you meet, and ask about and know the risk of any medication they want to prescribe.  My daughter developed avascular necrosis from the steroids they used to treat her and she was only on them for 4 months.  We never knew about this risk and sometimes the benefit of the medication does outweigh the risk, but if you don't know what the risks are, you cannot make an informed decision.   Do as much research as you can, and try to keep a journal along the way.  It may be helpful to you one day.\\nWarm wishes to you as you make your way through the coming weeks and that you find wonderful care for your son!\\nI have had UC for 21 years now, its not as bad now as it was in the beginning. I have excema on my hands and one eye lid. Other than that I don't have any other rashes or sight problems, however I do have a daughter that has had cataracts. I think there may have been a link between me taking steriods before i had her. She shows no signs of having UC - fingers crossed she doesn't.\\nHi there,\\n\\nMy son had an endoscopy and a further colonoscopy yesterday and we have been told he now has Crohn's Disease.  I don't know too much about how this differs from UC apart from the fact that UC affects all the colon whereas Crohn's affects anywhere between the mouth and anus.\\n\\nHe starts his treatment next Thursday 17th July and, as he is taking part in a study which involves around 80 children in the UK, he has to have regular bone scans, blood tests and urine samples.  His treatment will either be steroids or a special diet (which is like astronaut food).  We will not get to choose which treatment he receives, it will be chosen for him, as part of the study.\\n\\nI hope the treatment will put him into remission and then we can keep him there.\\n\\nHe is 12 years old next month.\\n\\nI would be most grateful for any advice.\\n\\nMany thanks,\\nClaire x\\n\\nP.S.  Sorry, still in a state of shock at the moment, don't think that it has quite sunk in - with either of us!\\nHi everyone,\\n\\nMy son is having treatment for Crohn's Disease (he was diagnosed last month).  This involves him being on a liquid feed diet for at least 6 weeks and he is receiving this feed by a NG Tube into his stomach.  I was wondering if there were any other mothers out there whose children are undergoing this treatment for Crohn's or UC?  His feed is Alicalm that we have to make it up (in the blender!) and then he feeds himself through his tube via an open ended syringe.  He is now five weeks into it and is still having problems with his bowels and stomach cramps and is still passing blood.  He did put on a couple of pounds but then lost them again and has now put on a couple more but all in all his weight fluctuates, even though he is having six fees a day and all the calories and nutrients that he needs to consume in a day!\\n\\nHe suffers alot with Conjunctivitis and is now complaining of pains in the backs of his knees and legs.  He has been getting rashes for some time now and I don't know if all this is a side effect of the disease or the treatment?  He is 12 years old, 4 feet 11 inches and weights 5 stone 7 pounds - 5 stone 12 pounds - depending on what day it is! - it does fluctuate that much!.\\n\\nHe is seeing his gastroenterologist next Thursday (4th September) and has to have a DXA scan that day also. We have been told that he may have to keep his tube in for longer but we have yet to know if the treatment is working.\\n\\nI would love to hear from anyone else who knows someone who is currently on this treatment.  It is all very new to us and we are still trying to come to terms and get to grips with it all!!\\n\\nMany thanks,\\nClaire x\\nClaire,\\n\\nI have read your posts about your son's problems with UC and now with Crohn's disease. I am very sorry.\\n\\nI do not know if you have investigated the use of probiotic supplements to treat these IB-diseases.\\nI have read about using VSL#3 a probiotic supplement to improve 95% of the IBS. There is a Sticky thread at the top of the IBS board of Healthboards that may be of interest to you. Although it started out about IBS -- post #12 on page 3 is about a member with UC that is being dramatically helped.\\n\\nI have also read that studies were being under taken to investigate the use of probiotics to help Crohn's in children.\\n\\nDoctors generally don't use this more natrual type treatment because they are trained to use medication that are drugs. So, don't be surprised if your doctors are not familiar with probiotic treatment.\\n\\nI wish you son well---Harry\",\n",

       " {'post': \"I was hoping to get some insight on the meds and info i just got on my daughters biopsies. She had a colonoscopy about a week ago and the doc called and told me that it looks like Crohns but they can not actually lable it that at this point due to some mutation that was differnt. They told me what they are calling it at this point is unidentified colitis. They put her one Entocort EC 3mg 3 times a day and Asacol 400 mg EC three times a day also. Has anyone taken these or are on them now? Have you had any bad side effects or and insight to anything i need to watch for. They said that they will check her again in 6 weeks to make sure the meds are working with her system. And then if they are working then she will be on them for about 2 years (unless things change as far as getting worse) and then they will do another colonoscopy to see where things are at that point. The nurse keep making comments about how it was Crohns but they could not actually lable it that yet. Can you tell me what the difference is between Colitis and Crohns. They kinda had the same basics from what i read.  Any information would be helpful at this point. And any help if there is anything to watch for or perhaps stay away from would be a great help also. Thank you for reading this and thank you for any advice.\\nPS> Just realived fianlly got some kind of idea what is going on and not wondering any longer about what else we need to do.\\nHi,\\nI'm new to this nonsense myself.  So, I really don't have much to say, especially about drugs.  I will say the Asacol is a 5-ASA drug, much like my Lialda (brand new drug).  My mom takes Asacol for her colitis, but I think her's is milder than mine - mine is called Ulcerative Colitis (related to Crohn's Disease), while her's is some other kind.  She's taken it for a while.  I only know what I've read on the Lialda inserts - there may be some concern about liver problems.  So, I think we all have to watch for that.\\n\\nAs far as UC (Ulcerated Colitis vs Crohn's Disease)-- UC is basically just what the word means - inflamed COLON.  Crohn's is supposed to be inflamed EVERYWHERE in the gut, all the intestines, not just colon.  (I half suspect I really have the Crohn's Disease.)  Not sure how they know because scopes don't reach beyond the colon.\",\n",

She is home now but she is still going through it so to speak with diarhea, nausea, and vomiting.  Her doctor prescribed her Prednisone to reduce the imflammation in the colon but now it appears that it is making her sick so the doctor advised her to cut down on the dose from one full pill to a half.\\n\\nThe doctor also informed us of all of the issues with UC and how UC is a ugly thing to have and treat.

The doctor has put her out on rest for another two weeks to get the immflamation down.  I guess my question is, when experiencing a bad flare-up that requires hospitalization, what is the recovery time and how long does it to get it under control again?

I have dealt with this for over 20 yrs. I have recently been in a very bad flare up. After many visits to my gastro dr and many weeks of pain and missed work, I went to a top specialist and he prescribed hydrocortisone enemas. It doesn\\'t react like your typical enema. It coats the rectum and colon with medication and helps to reduce the inflammation quickly. I also lost 20 lbs. and had no appetite. Every time I ate I was running to the bathroom. I have been using these enemas for 10 days and I feel so much better. I hope this info helps and that your wife is feeling better. I also am on the antibiotic cipro and a drug called imuran.',\n",

       " {'post': 'Good Morning-\\n\\nI am new to these boards.  I am very, very glad that I found it though.\\n\\nA little background- I have sphincter damage due to surgeries for a rectal abscess and anal fistula.  I also have Crohn\\'s.  Because of the damage, I have an almost constant leakage, with it being more significant directly after a BM.  I rarely am without gauze or toilet paper tucked between my cheeks to absorb any secretion, and this has been the case for 3 years.\\n\\nThis spring I had an anal ultrasound which showed significant damage to about 1/4 of the sphincter, etc.  I was told by my GI that this is permanent, likely to worsen as I age, and that no colorectal surgeon in our state would even make an appointment with me to discuss repair since Crohn\\'s means that I have a very difficult time healing in the rectal area.  He suggested fiber supplements and Immodium daily so as to constipate myself and minimize drainage.  Needless to say, I didn\\'t find that acceptable.  I am 37 with a 4YO son and a 1YO daughter.  I have things to do- places to go!  lol\\n\\nI have been doing Kegel and biofeedback for a few months without results, and I have an appointment with a colorectal surgeon in Boston who specializes in sphincter repair on August 3rd.  My GI thinks that this surgery may be my only hope for a solution.\\n\\nWay too late to make this long story short, but is there anyone out there with Crohn\\'s who has undergone this surgery?  I have found the other threads about sphincteroplasty very enlightening, and I thank you all for sharing such personal information.\\n\\nKathryn\\n\\nI just joined this message board and I\\'ve been searching the threads for someone who has similar problems to mine.  It sounds like I\\'m a male version of you.  Below is a post I left yesterday to try to explain my problems to the group.  Please write back with your experience since your original post.\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nI\\'m a 54 year old man with inactive Crohn\\'s disease.  In 1983 I suffered terribly from extremely painful anal abscesses, fissures, and a fistula that tunneled its way to the surface of my buttock as a result of the disease.  I had three surgeries including a fistulaectomy which left my buttock disfigured, my anus & rectum scarred, and even required my surgeon to cut the internal sphincter to resolve the problems.  The resulting scarring from the surgery left me with pencil-sized stools and fecal leakage.  The surgery substituted agonizing pain with disfigurement and the humiliation of dealing with my inability to stop soiling my underwear.  A good swap in my opinion.  I have happily dealt with those problems for over 20 years now.\\n\\nSometime after the surgery I became aware that my disease became quiet everytime I was put on Flagyl or other antibiotic for subsequent infections.  Finally, after many years of 10mg of cortizone daily to control my disease, I demanded my doctor take me off the steroids and put me on a low dose of antibiotic for a short time to try to control the disease.  He refused until I told him I would find a doctor who would.  He finally agreed and put me on a daily low dose (250 mg) of erythromycine (which I believe is commonly used to control acne).  Within six months my disease was completely quiet.  My disease was finally in remission!! I stopped the antibiotic and I\\'ve been off all medication for close to ten years now. Hooray!!!\\n\\nEarlier this summer I began to suffer from urgency again.  This time, there was no diarhhea or bloody stool, but, instead, constipation with a great deal of pressure and an inability to distinguish my urinary sphincter from my bowel sphincter.  I had a colonoscopy in June which showed no evidence of disease.  But, my physician had to use a pediatric colonoscope because of a stricture that\\'s formed.  While the stricture was always there since the surgeries in \\'83, it was minor and never a problem.  I could always easily evacuate and was never constipated.  Also, the fecal leakage had worsened.  And I\\'ve developed some small hemroids.  My doctor suggested I try Rowasa for two weeks, but he & I are both relatively sure I will need surgery to fix my problems.\\n\\nI meet with a surgeon next week to discuss my options.  I am relatively certain that dilation is in my future.  However, I need to stop the fecal leakage.  It\\'s become a real problem.  Previously, a small wad of strategically placed toilet paper would usually keep me clean.  That is no longer the case.  I believe I am a candidate for anoplasty.\\n\\nDoes anyone know what I am in for?  How long is recovery?  Will a colostomy be necessary?  Will I lose sexual function?  Having lived through the pain I did in \\'83, I am sure I can take the pain again of the surgery (or at least I hope I can).  But, am I simply substituting one set of problems for another set?\\n\\nIf anyone has experience with anoplasty & rectal dilation, I\\'d appreciate your thoughts.  Thanks to all in advance.\\nHi...\\n\\nIt does sound like we suffer from the same issues.  It can be quite frustrating, can\\'t it?\\n\\nAs for me, really the Crohn\\'s is not a problem except for the abcess/fistula issue 3 years ago.  I truly flare maybe once a year, and a round of prednisone or Entocort usually nips it quickly.  I do take immodium when needed, but really, that is a small price to pay.\\n\\nI saw the surgeon a month ago, and unfortunately he told me that he would not suggest the surgery unless I was at my wits end and ready to accept a colostomy as a possible outcome.  He agreed with the doctors in my area on the fact the disease makes healing difficult and could in fact deteriorate the muscle even further if it is compromised.  I have 2 tests in October to see if he can pin a percentage on the chances of things going wrong/right if I were to choose to go through with it.  I also have an appointment with a colostomy nurse so that I can have all of my information when I sit down and decide what to do.\\n\\nNeedless to say, that is a very big disappointment.  I had high hopes of trying to correct this- and like you, the pain of surgery would be worth dealing with for a result of fixing my fecal incontinence.  There are days that I think that a colostomy has to be better than this- the drainage and the rectal/anal pain.  And then there are days when I remind myself that it could be worse and to just deal with it.  My husband is wonderful in supporting me in whatever I decide, so that makes it easier in the end.\\n\\nLet me know how you are doing...\\nKathryn\\nGrin & Bear it... Suck it up!!  That\\'s been my mantra for 2 decades.  I was just in a meeting at work and had a bit of gas.  After the meeting I ducked into the men\\'s room to discover more \"soiled\" underwear.  It\\'s disgusting!  Previously I didn\\'t have fecal leakage to this extreme, except when I first had the fistulaectomy.  Anyway, I go to the surgeon on Sept 17th.  I\\'ll write you back after that with my options.  He\\'s apparently a very conservative surgeon, so I expect he won\\'t offer anoplasty as a solution either.  I have two problems though.  The stricture he can fix with dilation, I believe.  Whether that causes more incontinence is to be seen.\\n\\nThanks for listening.  My wife was very glad to hear I found this website.  As supportive as she is, I can get very depressed and sometimes she doesn\\'t want to deal with me.  And I can\\'t blame her.\\n\\nMac\\nHI Kathryn-\\n\\nI am 39 yrs old with crohn\\'s disease and I had a very traumatic birth 2 yrs. ago. I suffered a 4th degree tear and subsequently a very poor repair which lead to a rectovaginal fistula. My crohn\\'s is pretty quiet for the most part and has been for 17 years since I had a bowel resection. About 4 months after the traumatic birth, I had a sphincterplasty to repair the torn muscle and try to close the fistula. The repair worked in terms of anal function, but unfortunatley the fistula is still there. My surgeon never once suggested that I not get the surgery because of crohn\\'s. I have never had any perianal disease, so I don\\'t know if that makes a difference. I would consult with a few surgeons if I were you. He and a couple other surgeons have mentioned however that any additional surgery for the fistula maybe risky because of my crohn\\'s so I have held off on that. Needless to say, it has been a very difficult 2 years full of ups and downs and bouts with depression. I healed from the surgery though, but it wasn\\'t easy at all. It makes a bowel resection seem like a walk in the park. I still have some degree of urgency that I never had before and the very occasional leakage of gas. I take imodium and colestid to control diarrhea and that works great. Other than those meds, I don\\'t take anything else. Lots more to say I\\'m sure but if you have other questions, I\\'m here. So sorry you have to have these problems too.\\nKathyrn -\\n\\nI forgot to mention another very important treatment that my surgeon mentioned called sacral nerve stimulation. She said it was to become the gold standard of treatment for incontinence and told me never to worry about my control because this is a very promising non-invasive treatment. You should do a search for it and you will find lots of research. I believe it is in the process now of FDA approval. There is a women on the \"I survived Sphincteroplasty part 4\" named clancey that has had the procedure and has had success. Has your surgeon mentioned this procedure?\\nHi Robyn...\\n\\nI have never heard of that treatment- I will definitely look it up and see what I can find.  The surgon I saw was typical- no bedside manner and talked to the interns (teaching hospital) more than me.  Unfortunately, he is considered the best at this type of surgery in the Boston area, so I\\'m at a loss regarding finding someone for another opinion.  Do you mind me asking where you are located?\\n\\nThanks for the insight!!!\\nKathryn\\nKathryn -\\n\\nI live in Minneapolis. We have a great pelvic floor center here and the rectal surgeons are all wonderful within the practice. How did you here about your surgeon? I would think that in a large city like Boston there would be more than one who was competent in this type of surgery. Could you ask around in the circle of obgyn\\'s? Sometimes they are very familiar with the surgeons who do sphincteroplasty\\'s because of the association with birth trauma. My ob is the one who referred me to my surgeon. I also got a good reference from an ob nurse.\\n\\nThere are bad dr\\'s out there even when they are highly regarded. I went to a GI dr that was voted one of the best in mpls and she was actually one of the worst I have ever been too. I also went down to Mayo clinic after I had my sphincteroplasty to discuss the reoccurence of the rv fistula. I met with the head of colon and rectal surgery and wow was that a horrible experience. He told me I would need a colostomy to deal with the fistula and sent me to the colostomy nurse for consultation. He even suggested that it would be permanent. I ran out of there so fast in a major depression. My other surgeon in mpls insisted that a colostomy was not necessary and to give the fistula more time to heal to see what happens. The fistula has healed a great deal to a very tolerable level. My point is that this was a surgeon who was the head of the department and had years of experience and his recomendation was horrible and, I think, cruel. Hang in there and try to find more surgeons.\\nRobyn-\\n\\nHave you tried Remicade for your fistula?  When I had my anal fistula that wouldn\\'t heal for over a year, I did the Remicade infusions, and let me tell you- it worked, and it worked fast.\\n\\nKathryn\\nHi all.  This is my first time posting, but I recently had an anal sphincteroplasty and was looking for information on healing (to no avail), and thought I could add some input to this post.  I am a 23 year old female, who has Crohn\\'s and had a fistulotomy in 2003 that damaged roughly 1/3 of my sphincter.  After getting fed up with fecal incontinence I decided to meet with my doctor about surgical options.  My Crohn\\'s is completely under control and after a colonoscopy the surgeon said that a sphincteroplasty would probably be successful, and there was only a 1% chance of it making it worse.  I had the surgery 6 weeks ago and the wound is now ALMOST healed.  I went in for surgery on a Friday morning, and was released from the hospital on Monday evening.  I had a catheter and was not allowed to eat anything for 3 days, and then started a low fiber diet.  Between the catheter, no BM\\'s and IV antibiotics, they said I should be relatively safe from infection.  The worst part about the surgery was the constant pain and nausea.  No amount of pain killers seemed to kill the pain, and the inability to eat caused the pain killers to upset my stomach and I would often throw up after taking them.  When I returned home on Monday evening my mother pretty much took constant care of me.  While the repair work from the sphincteroplasty remained in tact, shortly after I got home and was moving more the surrounding stitches burst, leading to a large open wound (which the surgeons said happens 90% of the time).  This was probably the most painful part, and led to a much longer recovery period.  After about 2 weeks I could do things for short periods of time (sit, walk, stand etc.) and after 4 weeks I started a more normal routine.  At 6 weeks I still have not tried working out, and there is still occasional pain, but the wound is now very small and hopefully will be completely healed soon.\\n\\nThe surgeon said that everything looked extremely good, and that incontinence might be worse for up to 3 months after the surgery, but it is already better than it was before.  So far I am happy with my decision for surgery, and hope that everything continues to improve.  I would seriously consider the length of recovery time and very limited physical activity you will be able to do before having the surgery, but I literally couldn\\'t stand the incontinence anymore and was willing to do anything.  I think one of the most important factors for me was that I knew this problem wasn\\'t going away, and the chance of a successful surgery was only going to deteriorate with age.\\n\\nI hope this post helps, and if there is anything else I can help you with please let me know!',\n",

       " {'post': 'Greetings!\\n\\nIn December of 2006 I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Proctitis (UP) via a colonoscopy. Two sigmoidoscopies later, the diagnosis still stands despite multiple courses of oral medication, suppositories and enemas. In fact, since my original diagnosis, my condition has never gone into remission and not a day has passes that I haven’t bled. I am 21 years old.\\n\\nAt this point, my (second) gastroenterologist suggests prednisone; however I am very reluctant to accept his offer considering the harsh side effects associated with it. More so, I’m very reluctant to believe that prednisone is my saving grace considering NOTHING has worked thus far.\\n\\nI’ve read that some Ulcerative Proctitis patients, much like those of Ulcerative Colitis, will not respond to medical treatment. Why is this?\\n\\nI’ve asked both of my GI’s if surgery was an option for “extremely stubborn” UP, to which they both said “No way.” Why?\\n\\nCould it be that removing the affected colon is the only option for even some UP patients as well? Has anyone ever heard of surgery for UP patients?\\n\\nTo this extent, I would like to ask you if removing the affected colon (in Ulcerative Colitis) CURES the patient of all the food sensitivities/allergies that usually accompany UC and UP, both of which are autoimmune diseases. As is the nature of such diseases, many patients (myself included) become “allergic” to common foods almost overnight… or at least it seems this way.\\n\\nIn May of 2007, an allergist confirmed (via skin-testing) allergies to gluten, milk, yeast, sugar, eggs, corn, sunflower, banana and spinach, all of which were once consumed on a regular basis (some more than others) with no ill-response from my digestive system. However, soon after contracting UP and to this day, consumption of all aforementioned foods result in what can be described as nothing other than an “unpleasant experience.” Sublingual drops, prescribed to lessen my body’s autoimmune response, have done little to do so.\\n\\nSo, I ask again. To anyone who can relate… did surgically removing the affected colon wipe clean the food allergies that came with your Ulcerative Colitis/Proctitis? Is this logical to assume?\\n\\nMy theory as to why my UP has been extremely stubborn is because the root cause has not been addressed. That is, my newfound food allergies (which are nearly impossible to avoid mind you… but I do my best) are keeping my UP alive and well because even the slightest introduction of any of them into my digestive tract is enough excuse to cause a flare up.\\n\\nMy question then is… what ARE my options?\\n\\nI thank you in advance.\\nProctitis is Ulcerative colitis there are 5 different types of it, what you have only affects the lowest part of the rectum\\n\\nUC can be treated for flare-ups and remission but it can\\'t be cured unless you were to have the whole colon and rectum removed and have a colostomy bag. But surgery is only considered for those not responding to medicine, poorly responding to different medicine for a few years or when at risk of developing colon cancer.\\n\\nThere is not enough proven evidence of what causes UC it just happens from abnormal activation of the immune system. So there is no point holding on for hope it\\'s going to go away by finding an underlying problem, because that is your diagnosis so that is the problem you need to concentrate on treating.\\nYour food allergies have nothing to do with the UC because it is limited to your rectum your food has already been turned into waste before it reaches the affected area. There is no scientific research or back up that different foods causes a flare up unlike in Crohns disease.\\n\\nI have left sided UC which started when i was 18, i\\'m 20 now so i know all too well how frightening and disturbing the symptons are at a young age. But i was not diagnosed with it for another 7months when i had an endoscopy and luckily enough i had an appointment with my specialist the morning after i had a very very bad attack of my UC.\\n\\nI was put on Prednisoline (400mg) as a quick fix because anything ibuprofen based irritates my bowel. I was also put on Melasalazine a slow release anti inflammatory tablet, within 2 weeks i was back to normal and had my first solid bowel movement with no blood or cramps in 7 months.\\n\\nBut then the Prednisoline side effects kicked in in the 6th week, everything listed i had, weight gain, fatigue, achey joints, puffy face, eye infections, hair loss, acne! Nightmare. So i stopped taking them and withing 6 hours i couldnt move my body was stiff and sore i was blacking out.. nobody told me i had to be weaned off them but within an hour of taking the Prednisoline i was fine.\\n\\nI went to see my specialist who said he would wean me off them gradually then just try me with the Melasalazine, the steroids are only a quick fix and permanent effects only take effect after 6 months of taking them.\\n\\nI strongly advise you try them because medication is the only thing thats going to help you.\\n\\nI was very vain and stopped taking all the medicine because i\\'m a dancer and part time model so acne and hair loss from the melasalzine did not fit in with my lifestyle and wow did i put my body through hell.\\n\\nBut since breaking my foot 4 weeks ago i have found that drug abuse was the cause of my UC and i really really regret being so stupid.\\n\\nMaybe this website will help you more\\n\\n[url]http://www.medicinenet.com/ulcerative_colitis/article.htm[/url]\\n\\nHope i was of some help, good luck x\\nThank you for your prompt (and thorough) reply CandyKiss! Truth be told... I thought I was quite young for my diagnosis... but you have me beat by 2 years!\\n\\nPerhaps I wasn\\'t clear in my initial post. I have in fact tried both oral and rectal medications, as well as varying combinations (Asacol, Lialda, Rowasa, Canasa and Cort-enemas) to no avail and certainly no remission. The only medication I haven\\'t tried yet is Prednisone. Your testimony has made me second-guess my stubbornness, however.\\n\\nIt also seems like you have found a root-cause for your UC (drug abuse)... I am still scratching my head on that one. My dad and grandfather (dad\\'s side) both had polyps and that same grandfather was just diagnosed with Colitis... so I guess there\\'s my excuse. Thanks, Dad!\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t be so quick to say that foods\\naggravate UC/UP symptoms, however, even if leading research does not support this. Prior to my diagnosis, I could eat anything and everything care-free. Don\\'t be fooled: I am very slim, having the advantage of a fast metabolism, and have always been very health-conscious.\\n\\nNow, post-diagnosis, all foods that I\\'m apparently \"allergic\" to cannot be consumed without a revolt from my bowels EVERY time. This\\ncannot be a coincidence.\\n\\nThink about it: we\\'ve covered that UC as well as UP are autoimmune disorders. Logically, this seems to give my theory some leverage as it is presumed that, in such scenarios, our immune systems are already dazed and confused. Mind you my food allergies seemed to appear concurrently with the onset of my UP. This too...\\ncannot be a coincidence.\\n\\nI know gluten seems to be the scapegoat for every disease under the Sun nowadays... but there seems to be compelling evidence out there that a strict gluten-free diet is paramount for healing in certain individuals. Some testimonies of this can even be found on these boards (see: [url]http://www.healthboards.com/boards/showthread.php?t=588959[/url]).\\n\\nKeeping track, I do not believe that my UP\\'s location makes it immune, so to speak, from flare-ups triggered by food (if we can agree that it is capable of doing so) as an autoimmune response could very well be initiated the moment a \"trigger food\" enters the alimentary canal (mouth to anus). The response could then either single-out the already-compromised section of intestinal wall (the rectum, in my case) OR... the response could be far more generalized and widespread... it\\'s just that the weakest link in the chain (i.e., my UP-infested rectum) succumbs because it cannot \"defend\" itself properly.\\n\\nIf I\\'ve made no sense thus far... then consider this: why do people who are VERY allergic to certain foods (say shellfish, for example) breakout in hives? Did the shell fish have to physically touch the skin... or is the reaction coming from within? Similarly... is it the actual\\nof peanut butter with the esophagus that causes it to close in individuals who are severely allergic to it? Or... is the source of the reaction taking a more behind-the-scenes approach? The same scenarios could be applied to airborne allergies. My point is this... it makes perfect sense to me that a local reaction can be caused by a trigger (be it food or whatever) that is not. It also makes perfect sense to me that a food could be this very trigger in some individuals, especially when dealing with autoimmune disorders where the immune system is already compromised and assumed ill. Why couldn\\'t the immune system, then, erroneously respond to something harmless and cause a domino-effect reaction? Why is food only allowed to be a trigger in Crohn\\'s Disease? Aren\\'t Crohn\\'s and Ulcerative Colitis closely-related in principle?\\n\\nI also couldn\\'t help but to notice a healthy dose of cynicism in your reply, in regards to curing my disease. While I\\'m well aware UP is currently \"incurable\" by every stretch of the definition, I would still hold out hope that some radical, back-alley Chinese medicine doctor may have to key to our digestive woes. Perhaps I\\'m not jaded by the disease just yet... but I refuse to believe that Prednisone and a couple tightly-crossed fingers are my only options left.\\n\\nWe always have to consider... what if prednisone just doesn\\'t work? What if my UP is just too \"far out of reach\" (cause its RIGHT at the anus) for any oral medication to do any damage?\\n\\nPerhaps it\\'s the Anatomy & Physiology courses talking... but if there\\'s one thing I\\'ve learned it\\'s that the human body, and its inherent processes, are amazing, precise and (above all) smart. I want to believe that my body is constantly trying to heal itself, inside and out, and is \"consciously\" trying to resolve my digestive woes. Perhaps it needs a little help... and perhaps that help will be in the form of Prednisone... but that does not mean there\\'s a better alternative out there, somewhere.\\n\\nIn addition to seeing two GI\\'s, I\\'ve sought the advice from a local family practice who substitutes vitamins and herbs for conventional medicine. Their suggestions have far from cured me... but they\\'ve\\nslightly. That\\'s gotta stand for something.\\nI can see the logic your trying to make of it,\\n\\nFood residues which have not been digested and absorbed in the small intestine pass down into the lower bowel and are fermented by the bacteria that live there. It is believed that an immune reaction against the bacteria living in the bowel is a very important factor in the cause of Crohn’s disease and that the activity of these bacteria can be modulated by diet.\\n\\nDiet does not work in Ulcerative Colitis, because the bacteria involved rely not on food residues but on substances which naturally occur in the bowel, such as mucus, for their energy requirements. The reaction to foods is quite different to allergy where special antibodies are circulating in the blood.\\n\\nThis means that skin ***** and blood tests for allergy are of no help in deciding which foods need to be avoided.\\n\\nFrom when i was diagnosed with UC i was not told for another 3 months i would have it for life even though i had read it on so many websites but i didn\\'t want to believe it.\\n\\nMaybe your not happy with my reply because i have stated i think it was caused by drugs (i don\\'t even know if it is the case, but i would like to think now i have stopped taking drugs i won\\'t have any more flare-ups because i have been fine for 4 weeks *fingers crossed* but only time will tell. Wishful thinking really.\\n\\nAll the information i have gave you has come from the many websites i looked at, as you have probably done.\\n\\nI think maybe your confusing your food allergy reactions which will cause bowel movements, cramps, flatulence with the UC. The UC flare-up is the inflammation (ulcers) and when it gets irritated for example wind or passing a bowel movement the bleeding occurs. The food has already been broken down before it reaches your affected area, the foods wont effect you until they are in or are passing / passed through the effected area and at the rectum you would already be passing the food. It can\\'t cause a reaction until it has reached the effected area.\\n\\nI went to a chinese doctor... firstly he told me i had a lot of heat inside me by looking at my red tongue (i had been drinking cherryade) then he told me my problem was with my liver. The stuff he wanted to sell me would have cost £65 a week, if i knew it was the cure i wouldnt think twice.\\n\\nApologies if i have offended you in anyway, its worth giving the prednisoline a go before considering surgery unless the UC really effects your quality of life. Even if it gets the main flare-up under control so you can re-introdce the other medicines. Its just a shame either way you have to deal with unwanted symptons.\\n\\nGood luck, let me know how it goes if you want to chat. I\\'m an open person all my family /friends know the insides out of my bowel movements, funny enough they don\\'t seem as interested in it as me lol\\nThis is such interesting reading.  I was diagnosed with Proctitis two months ago (just before my 30th birthday after 2 months of bleeding), and I never understood why my doctor said that food doesn\\'t effect my condition.  It seemed clear to me that it did, but candykiss\\'s comments are opening my eyes.\\n\\nThere are two things that make me go to the bathroom before I would naturally have to go - coffee and a hangover.  I thought for sure that hard alcohol and coffee were keeping me from getting better, but now I see that its the going to the bathroom more frequently that\\'s keeping me from getting better.  And I was going more frequently when I\\'d have coffee or too much alcohol.  This is also true of overeating or having too much fatty/proceesed foods.  Basically, anything that makes you go to the bathroom more (and therefore aggravate your ulcers) is going to prolong your flare-up.\\n\\nNow obviously using the right medicines to complement my efforts is a necessity, but am I thinking on the track?  I\\'m trying to understand this disease to help treat it, but this is all so new to me.  What you do you think?\\nI had ulcerative colitis, at the age of 14, ii was a health enthusiast. I played football at county level, and one day i just got pains, i was cramping up soo bad. I was crying becuase it hurt so bad, oh becuase i was ill and i didn\\'t know what happening to me,, i went to my local hospital and they sent me home with a few painkillers.\\ni didnt get any better,, so i went back and had my appendix out, stupid idiots thought it was the end of my troubles but noo, they sent me homee, again with a few painkillers,, i got even worse, so once again my mum drove me up to the hospital and they kept me in, i got put into a private room becuase they thought i had a super bug ( which i didnt) and i went to the toilet and blood came out of my stool, i was SCARED, soo scared i didnt know what was going to happen,, i thought i was dying. The sent me up to a specialist hospital where i had an endo-scope, this revealed i had thickening of the bowel.\\ni got worse and worse, i was going to the toilet over 17 times a day, each time losing blood, and weight, everything i ate went straight through me, by the end of my 1st month there i looked like a walking skeleton, and i was 6 stone, and that\\'s not good for some1 6foot1.\\nnothing worked, it was hope that we all knew wouldnt work, steriods didnt work.. my consultant was away for a week doing a semenar in Liverpool, so they sent an adult Peadeatricion to see me, and he said yeah, you need your bowel out, i cried once againn. so it came D-Day,  friday the 13th of april 2007, it went well the operation, i was gaining weight fast and my ileostomy worked fine, and the suddenly i got illl, pain like before,, and i went down for ultrasounds and scans and it revealed collections of sepsis. so i went for emeergency surgery at 4 am, i got kept asleep for 36 hours. when i was in intesive care, the nurse said to my mum \" there\\'s a high chance your son wont live\" and  it was hell, they were treating me with drugs and one day i started fitting, once again, everything going wrong, losing weight, becuase i was on four ice cubes a day, nothing else,, cutting things down..  i had pancreatitis, 26 different scans, fits, urine infection, sepsis, kidney stones and lots more.\\ni came out of hospital and i got better,, my luck was turning. i gained weight slowly but steadily and played football again,, with my Ileostomy, and im a goalkeeper so its goodd for me.  i had another operation on the 10th december for an Ileo-anal pouch, and im still waiting for confirmation for my last one.\\nif i can make it,,\\nyou can!!\\nHi,\\n\\nI was diagnosed with mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis (left side of colon) last Monday.  I\\'m so devastated!  I\\'m 41 years old.  Just 10 months ago I started living again after taking care of my mom with Alzheimer\\'s and in the end lung cancer.  I thought I would have a great life at least until I got in my 60\\'s or around there but now, here I am, 41 years old and now I have to take care of myself ... a lot more than I used to.  Anyway, I was put on Asacol 2 tabs 3 times a day.  I started a week and a day ago.  How long does it usually take to kick in?  I\\'m still bleeding and having loose stool occasionally.  Tomorrow I have an appointment with my GI doc.  She said last week if I wasn\\'t better she was going to put me on Prednisone.  I don\\'t want to be on that.  I know the side effects are not good.  Are there other meds I can take to get this disease under control?\\n\\nThanks for any advice.  I really appreciate it.\\n\\nTami\\nI am 41 and was diagnose with Proctitis Colitis two years ago. I have tried enemas, salofalk etc. and nothing worked.\\n\\nAs per my doctor, my last option outside of surgery is prednisone which he had warned me of side effects.\\n\\nI started with 60 mg daily for about 4 months and it worked. No more pain , fevers, aches that i use to encounter. After being on it for 6 months, I started getting the puffy face, weight gain, bad mood swings and recently acne on my face. I am now down to 15 mg daily and hopefully will be off it soon. For me, it was worth dealing with the side effects instead of the gruelling pain that I was dealing with daily. There are days, where I dont feel that way.\\n\\nI will start with Salofalk again after I am completely off Prednisone, which I look forward to.\\nI was reading one of your other posts from a few years ago about your urinary troubles (cloudy, burning, and dribbling) I have all of the same symptoms and I was wondering if you ever found out what was wrong with you. I\\'m really eager to know if this is something I can fix, thank you!',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi last year I had every test done unver the sun because I get diarrhea 3 or 4 times a week.I wont list all the test because I had them all done all of them.But at the end of all the tests the doctor told me I have inflamed intestines and thats all he said and told me to keep taking imodium .But from everything I look up on the internet if I type inflamed intestines it leads me right back to Colitis.Does anyone here have Colitis at all and if so can you tell me what your sysmptoms are.Im going back to talk with my gastro doc but It takes months to get in so any imput from anyone that has colitis would be helpfull.I just dont understand my gastros diagnosis at all inflamed intestines .shouldnt he have told me a little more.Is it possible to have inflamed intestines without having colitis?\\n[QUOTE REMOVED]\\n\\nHey Ctbo,\\n\\nI have colitis! Before I started taking meds for it I was going multiple times during the day, so much that I had to keep medicated wipes with me to keep my shoot from burning constantly! I think the worst was when I would start to get sick because my stomach would start to churn and I would keel over in pain. Other random things that happened were things like I would get headaches from the pain or my back would hurt really bad. Umm I was loosing so any vitamins in my system that my eyes would burn (loss of potassium) before I would get sick or really dizzy right before...\\n\\nBUT, what I would suggest is to get a second opinion. Yes you can have intestinal swelling. That could come from going so much. Did they at least say to watch what you eat??\\n\\nI\\'ve kept a diary of what I eat and noticed all of the things that make me sick. Like for example... NO STEAK!-- o my goodness. If I eat steak I\\'m in pain within 10 minutes! It\\'s the worst!\\n\\nOh did they say it was your intestines because if it\\'s your upper intestines it could be Crohn\\'s disease which I\\'ve been told is sometimes confused with Colitis... but maybe if your lucky you just have IBS!\\n\\nWell I wish you the best of luck in your future gastro visits, If you have any questions.. you can ask.. I\\'m only 23 and I\\'ve had I think just about everything done too! And I\\'ve taken just about all the meds available for colitis!\\n\\nTalk to ya later!\\nFor those who have been diagnosed with colitis, or have diarrhea constantly with no diagnosis, I have been suffering with this for over 4 years. Gotten worse in the last year, as I lost my husband after years of sickness. The stress made the colitis worse, of course. Like most of you, I tried every medicine that my gastro doctor could think of. He finally had to refer me to MUSC in Charleston, SC (medical university) as he was stumped as to what to do next. I have lost 30+ pounds in the last year, and regardless what I eat, I cannot gain any weight back. After having 3 colonscopies and endoscopies, the diagnosis was microscopic colitis. The two gastroenterologists finally decided conservative measures were not working, so they decided to get aggressive. I was placed on a chemo drug used for leukemia patients. It\\'s called Mercaptopurine. It has helped me significantly as instead of have chronic diarrhea 10-12 times per day, I\\'m down to an average of 7. To me, that\\'s very significant. I still have the diarrhea, however. If this medication does not work, then they will do infusion therapy. I\\'m not sure what that involves. The last resort would be surgery. I simply cannot afford to have surgery at this point in my life (58) as I have no one to care for me at home. So I hope the gastro doctors are satisfied with the results of the mercaptopurine. However, it does cause side effects just like any chemo drug would. You don\\'t have the entire baldness, but there is a thinning of the hair. If it helps me, though, I don\\'t care. So if your doctor has tried all the other medications, i.e., Endocort, etc., you might want to ask him/ her about the mercaptorune.\\nMy wife has Microscopic Colitis and it first surfaced two years ago.  She was vomitting and had diarrhea at the same time for over two months.  She got over it, but her father passed away last March and she had a flare-up that she is just getting over.  I was wondering, you mentioned Endocort, but did your doctors try Prednisone?  That\\'s what my wife\\'s GI Doc finally used with her.  They started at 40 mg for a month and then weaned her off of it by 10 mgs per week, down to 10 mg and then she went to 5 and then off the next week.\\n\\nI have IBS myself, which is very similar and some say it is actually a form of Colitis.  When mine flared up 10 or 11 years ago and I had diarrhea 10 times or more per day, they tried every drug in the books to slow mine down.  Due to the associated pain with it, my doctors finally put me on Hydrocodone to slow the gut and help with the pain.  It worked and I am still on the pain meds, although different ones today.\\n\\n\\nThat is the same here. Ive been sick for past two months and found out three weeks ago (after going to 7 drs, 2 diff hospitals...who didnt know what was wrong) by going to a dr out of town. he told me the exact same thing. the inflamed intestines. I searched on the internet and found colitis. I have been told there were diff kinds of colitis...which when i go back to the dr, I will ask him. I wish they were more detailed. To answer your question, everytime I search for the defination for colitis...its when the the intestines are inflamed. but like i said..there are diff kinds of colitis.\\nmy symphtoms....i would have diareha bout once every week at least. I couldnt hold down anything. I had real bad abodmen pain. Sinus really bad. And really really bad migranes. The dr at first, told me not to eat anything but protein drinks. for almost two weeks thats all i had. then he put me on just mashed potatoes. and im going on my 2nd week of just mashed potatoes. and im still having pain.\\nlemme know what he says. what kind of symptoms do u have?\\nI had ulceritive colitis. After not responding to my meds i was sent down the path of this stuff called probiomax. It took three weeks for all symptoms to disappear. I don\\'t know for sure if it will have the same effect for you as it did for me but you gotta start somewhere. It\\'s actually made for C. diff but it cleared me up without a recurrence for almost three years. So i recommend at least giving it a look.\\nI posted on this same subject in July 2008 as my doctor had tried another medicine for my microscopic colitis, which was mercaputurine. This is a chemo-type of drug used to treat leukemia, but some doctors had success using it with Chron\\'s patients and UC patients. After being on it for two months, the side effects were worse than the chronic diarrhea I suffer from. Mouth sores, chronic fatigue, and the diarrhea went from 10-12 times per day to about 7-8 per day. That\\'s not enough for me to stay on the medicine. So now I\\'m back to square one. My gastor doctor wants to send me back to MUSC for infusion therapy to help build up my immune system, but right at this time of the year, it\\'s just not feasible. I\\'m dreading Nov. 11, as that is the day my husband died a year ago. Then the holidays are right behind that. So I told my gastor doctor that I have had this for 4 years, lost 30 pounds, but I could wait another 3-4 months until after the holidays. I just want to go somewhere to be by myself but my family is not going to hear of that. Anyway, try to talk to your doctor about WHAT kind of colitis you have, i.e., ulcerative colitis, microscopic colitis, or just plain colitis (is there such a thing)? Only your doctor can tell from sure. You\\'ll probably have to start on numerous medications until you find one that works. I still haven\\'t been able to find that magic pill yet. I have heard Prednisone works wonders for some people, but it did absolutely nothing for me. I have a friend who was actually diagnosed with celiac disease AND microscopic colitis. When she reached 88 lbs. the doctors knew it was getting to be life-threatening. Tried her on Prednisone for the colitis and it helped her 100%. She has \"flareups\" but not an everyday thing, like most of us have. Her celiac disease is under control with proper diet. On top of all that, her breast cancer spread to her liver and lungs, so she\\'s really have all sorts of problems. My problems seem so insignificant when compared to hers. Keep your chin up and discuss this in detail with your doctor. It\\'s a disgusting subject but it has to be done. Keep us posted. Good luck.\\nTo NanaSharon:\\nI had Cronic Ulcerative Colitis back in the \\'70\\'s.  I got it soon after I got married. My husband turned into a Dr. Jekyl as soon as we got married. After our second son was born, I went with my sons to live without him, near my parents. ANYHOW....After having colitis for about seven years, having cramps and diahhrea all day long, I saw an article in Prevention magazine about a Dr. O. Carl Simonton who was an Oncologist (cancer doctor) who decided to use Immagery with his patients. He asked them to find a quiet place without distractions am, noon and pm and lay down and concentrate on where their cancer was and to immagine their white blood cells as little soldiers, and demand that they go to destroy the cancer cells. Well everyone seemed to improve rapidly.  So in addition to that, I read articles in books about colitis and some experts suggested food allergies, especially milk and also stress.  Well, I avoided milk and ate a better diet and started taking a Multi-B Vitamin with C and Iron and started the Imagery. Well within a week or two my COLITIS WENT AWAY!!!  Hope you and others try this and go off the \\'pills\\', too. But Prednizone....you have to wean yourself off. Talk to the doctor and ask him how slowly and try to avoid antibiotics and take Acidolphilis, too.  Good luck.',\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi,\\n\\nI'd like to know if this can be confirmed, though it seems pretty evident to me, are there trigger foods, foods which can trigger a UC flare-up?\\n\\nFrom the first flare up or incident of that disease, I was free of any symptoms for 8 years. I wasn't even taking medication. I had taken them at the start but dropped them after they seemed to make my intestine more irritable. And because I prefer to live medication-free, as much as possible. So, I was ok for a long time and the disorder never manifested 'spontaneously' (save for the first episode if any of this really happens spontaneously, without triggers).\\n\\nThe second time it took place, I had been ingesting chocolate at an unprecedented rate for me! I had discovered, inadvertently, certain products I liked, and I became- almost - a chocoholic.\\n\\nHowever, after several weeks of ingesting chocolate, varieties of chocolate products, not just the same one (I feel that was worse), I started suffering a bit of diahrea, but it would go away with a day of not eating chocolate or other irritating food. But I would get back to it as soon as I felt better. After several more weeks of this, it's as if my intestine couldn't take it anymore, and then the diahrea would become persistent.\\n\\nThis has happened to me 3 times in the last 4 years, the same exact pattern.\\n\\nI'd go to an emergency ward and when I'd tell the specialist who'd treat me that my flare-up was due to my poor eating habits, he dismissed that.\\n\\nBut if he had been in my place, it would have been evident. I may have an underlying condition, but it seems that it can be triggered by certain foods. And in my case by prolonged and rather considerable consumption of chocolate. I was eating at the rate of about 1 lbs of chocolate, 5 days a week. (5 X 1 lbs).\\nNot candy bars but chocolate that is mostly, really chocolate (with a few additional ingredients such as lecithin, etc, but otherwise nothing like your regular Mars bar!).\\nAnd it was milk chocolate most of the time.\\n\\nNot only would I like to know if science does know anything about this, but also, are there 'natural' treatments, other than having to take mesalamine or others?\\n\\nI already use pre and probiotic supplements (just started), will use Omega-3 tablets (these last two seem to be more and more recommended? I've heard of others also...) and feel that exercise and relaxation help a lot.\\n\\nThanks for any help!\\nAs I was reading your post I was going to suggest that you take an omega 3 supplement but then read your last paragraph and you already are.\\n\\nI would guess that the chocolate with its higher levels of omega 6 has pushed your digestion out of equilibrium.\\n\\nGetting the balance right between your intakes of fatty acids can take abit of time though so be patient.\\n\\nAnd please let us know if the increased omega 3 intake helps at all. It would be useful to know as I'm a bit of a chocolate smack head myself. Cheers, kennyboy\\nSeems like people with colitis and Crohns all have some foods that bother them everyone is different as to what foods those are. Find those foods that bother you and eat as small amounts as possible or avoid all together..\\nFor me its onions and beef\\nThanks both of you\\nbut do you know if the flare ups can be caused by foods?\\n\\nI'm not talking about increased symptoms only. But going from seeming remission to the illness becoming active?\\nI don't suffer from this myself Mike but if you think about it logically it must be a fairly good guess that some foods will trigger a recurrence. It's cause and effect really and I think you have answered your own question in your first paragraph....yes it is obvious. But as the other poster has said, the trigger food is going to be different for different people.\\n\\nThe only thing that seems to bring on colitis in a lot of people is the use of antibiotics. They attack the good bacteria in the gut as well as whatever else you might have taken them for, have you been using any? Chocolate might be OK for you in lower quantities. Everything in moderation as they say.\\nNo, I haven't taken antibiotics. Just a lot of chocolate.. !\\n\\nI noticed I have no problem when I take it in small quantities. Or at least not large quantities frequently.\\n\\nI was wondering since a gastro once told me that there was no such thing -food triggering the problem. He thought I was trying to deny I had a disorder. I told him no, I understand I have an underlying problem but I've only had the flare ups after eating excessive amounts of chocolate for months.\\n\\nThat was back in 2006, so maybe they know a bit better now...\\n\\nthanks!\\nHm, if you have UC I'd recommend toning down your chocolate consumption. Some of the basic foods to avoid are foods with alcohol, a whole load of fibre, caffeine, gass producing foods, greasy foods, spicy foods, and any foods that cause constipation (no need to agravate a sensitive colon either way!) Other lifestyle factors can also trigger it - stress is a big one, and that can be from anything!\\n\\nUC, as far as my experience goes, is a fairly unreasonable illness. I wouldn't try to lay all the blame on a single food; like any illness it is more complicated than that. The best approach is probably to do a bit of research and then figure out what applies to you and give it a serious try.\\nFor a disease like UC I don't think there are any absolutes about a cure. My case was pretty rotten, eventually got an illeostomy (best devision ever, but still a last resort) so not everyone will feet the same, but UC is an illness with no cure. Remission can be a relative name. Some people never have problems again - some people become increasingly worse. Sometimes meds can control it or maintain it in remission.\\n\\nSome other suggestions for foods to consider avoiding if you're not feeling well: caffeine, alcohol, massive doses of fibre (they told me never to eat uncooked veggies - altho sometimes I did!), greasy foods, spicy foods, foods that cause constipation (best not bother an upset colon either way), and any foods that commonly cause gas.\\n\\nAnd some suggestions for foods TO eat:\\nyohgurt, bananas, rice, oatmeal, sort of the medium fibre bland foods, soups, etc... Also drink lots of water, drinks with electrolytes, and a bit of salt content (sports drinks are good) because you can get really dehydrated really quick with UC.\\n\\nSo anyways, that's my advice.\\nThanks dictionary! I know I have to tone my chocolate consumption. That I'm pretty sure of!\\n\\nI'm just wondering what others might say about this. Because the last time I spoke with a gastroenterologist, he told me there was no evidence that foods could bring on ulcerative colitis (as in activating it, not causing it).\\n\\nI'm going to go by my own experience.\\n\\nThanks!\",\n",

       " {'post': \"\\n\\nHello, your external skin tag is probably your body’s response to an anal fissure. By having it removed you won't cure the underlying cause unfortunately. The mucusy discharge and diarrhea could be due to an internal infection or an abscess, again your body trying to cure itself of the fissure. Fissures cause terribly pain when you pass stools and having diarrhea could be masking the painful effects of the fissure. Read everything on these boards to do with anal fissure to educate yourself. It seems that an operation (LIS) is the only cure but if you read my thread entitled 'do these oils really work' you might find something there to help. I think the thing you must do is try to get rid of the infection first, (see your doctor for some antibiotics) and then tackle the fissure as the underlying cause of your problems. Don't forget to post back and report on your progress or attempts at self cure. Good luck\\nSkin tags are usually a result of an active anal fissure. If you are having diarrhea try adding calcium supplements to your diet, they tend towards constipation, if you are constipated try magnesium supplements. Seeing your doctor might be the best option because you can get all your questions answered and he can have a first hand look at what's going on. Are you taking an antibiotic for your rosacea because antibiotics can cause diarrhea. Also a good doctor will not remove a skin tag while a fissure is active because it will just come back again, the skin tags are what helps protect the fissure. Try using wet wipes after you have a bm or sitz baths rubbing the area only makes matter worse. Good luck Suzy.\\nThank you both for replying.\\n\\nI do not take antibiotics for my Rosacea, I use Metrogel on my face.  Metrogel controls it really well.  Also, I am DEATHLY allergic to penicillin.  I haven't taken any kind of Antibiotics in years.\\n\\nI have been taking this product, called Irritable Bowel Syndrome tablets, by Digestive Advantage. They are chewable probiotics.  I find that they help, if I keep taking them every day.\\n\\nI will get some wet wipes; TP is HARSH!\\n\\nThank you both again for your advice! I appreciate it.\\n\\nCheers!\\nOh I feel your pain! I was diagnosed with Crohns disease 8 years ago and have had all kinds of rectal and bowel problems. You are doing the right thing in contacting your doctor and I hope he orders some tests to see whats causing your diarrhea. I hope he also answers your questions about the skin tag as I know those can be painful. I just joined this forum and already finding so many useful things and hope we can all help each other! Good Luck!\\nThank you, every one, for replying.  I saw my General Practioner on Monday, 29 Dec and she ran all kinds of blood tests.  Blood results: A OK.\\n\\nI don't get it; along with the chronic diarrhea, I am extremely fatigued, too.\\n\\nSO! She referred me to a Colo-Rectal Surgeon and she was in the same building as my doc.  I have an appt 5 Jan.  Maybe I can get this issue under control and finally find out what is plaguing me.\\n\\nSuzy, I had my husband purchase some of the packages of wet wipes...they are awesome and really help with the discomfort of TP.\\n\\nKennyboy,  I have also thought of using the oils to help my skin tag.  It is HUGE! It is totally embarrassing, but I am feeling so sick from constant diarrhea and fevers that I finally did break down and talk to my doc about it.\\n\\nNext trip is to the GI doctor.  A step in the right direction.\\n\\nHAPPY NEW YEAR, ALL!!\\n\",\n",

She was initially put on Asacal, and steroids.  Of course, the roids caused her to catch colds, etc. and are not a long term viable option.  Is there any viable treatments out there?

Apparently it has really bad side effects, can increase cancer likelihood and something about TB.  I bought her some probiotics.  Any diet tips would be most appreciated.  Thanks again.\\nKathy\\n\\nHi Kathy,\\n\\nI\\'ve been taking Remicade for two months now without any problems, but my dr. intends to take me off it after the third infusion. One thing I\\'ve noticed is that if I don\\'t control what I eat, I will still have symptoms...but not as severe as before.\\n\\nps.\\nbad foods for me are sweets (cakes, sodas, candy, milk..)\\n\\nGood luck,\\n\\nKF\\nHi everybody\\nI have been with uc for 14 months now without a break and waiting for remission but nothing , the last year has been hell, i\\'ve been on Asocol, colizide and many others. 3 courses of steroids and nothing. The consultant keeps on about an operation and that is the only cure removing all of the large bowel and colon but no guarrantee of a reversal from a bag.Three weeks ago i was offerered a week stay in hospital and cortizone injections 4 times a day plus cortizone enemas twice a day, I am now out and on another course of steroids but after two days in hospital my problem ceased, no blood, muchas or diarrea. It is so nice not to be going to the loo 15 to 20 times a day and if it means every 6 months a stay in hospital i\\'ll take it.\\n\\n\\nChris,\\n\\nI believe you can get uc under control through diet. I\\'ve managed it and many others...why not try eliminating certain foods from your diet like all sugars, breads, milk and cheeses? That means no cookies, biscuits, bread, sodas or even foods that contain yeast extract. By following this bland type of diet, myself and many others are now med free.\\n\\nI was like you, going 15 to 20 times a day before going on Remicade, which helped a little, but it was the diet that got me back to normal. I go 2 to 3 times a day and my energy levels are almost normal...if you decide to follow a diet like this one, read the ingredients on everything it\\'s amazing how many products contain sugar and it doesn\\'t take much to make you experience symptoms again. For most of us, sugar is the worst offender because it creates the worst symptoms quickly...you might also want to reduce your starch intake a little as well.\\n\\nThere\\'s more I can say, but I\\'ve written a small book already,\\n\\nTake care,\\n\\nKF\\nHi Kingfootie\\nThanks for the reply i must say that i\\'ve been out of hospital nearly 3 months and absolutely fine only go once a day and ii\\'m off Predisone 4 weeks ago and i take Sulfasalazine 500 mg tablets twice a day and i feel rejuvenated also i eat whatever i want. i think this illnes is not a one cure suits all but once you find something to suit you go with it. Best of luck to you and all Healthboard members Chris.\\nAnyone else get joint pain with their UC and if so can you describe it ie is it sharp jabs, does it move around, etc.\\nhi cris\\nsorry to hear you had a spell in hospital it\\'s really scary but once youre in ther youre in ther hands, the fright seems to go away because you no that they no what there doing, still its horrible thought but why cant they just work on  finding something we could do at home instead for ourselves.  by the way my name is janet and i have suffered with colitus for about thirtyfive years since i was 14 years old, i have tried asocol, salazapyrine, lopperimide,omeprazole, retention enemas, suppositries, prednisolone, and nothing seems to work the diet hasent worked either, i rely on lopperimide to stop me from going to the loo,if i dont take them for one day i get a pain in my stomache and back of my bottom, its a very horrible pain and i start taking my lopperimide again and after a day or two i get back to normal but after a few days i start getting constipated again so its a vishers circle is your colitus like this i would love to here it or any ideas would be good.       janet from canvey island essex england\\nHi,\\n\\nI was reading the IBS board and found a thread worth reading.\\n\\nUlcerative Colitis (UC) can be greatly helped with a probiotic supplement.\\nThe thread is at the top of the IBS board --titled--- \"95% Improved with VLS3\"\\n\\nI think all people that have UC should read it.

I\\'m 39 and have had this ugly disease since 19. The good news is I have been in remission soon to be 6 yrs.  So, there is hope. I can offer a little advise for you but I would strongly urge you to see a Doctor as soon as possible. Until you see a Doctor make sure you keep plenty of liquids in you as you will rapidly dehydrate.\\n\\nAs for food-- eat Plain -Plain- PLAIN. Especially when you are having a flare up. When ever I have been hospitalized, I was always on a clear diet  soup broths, chicken or beef (don\\'t add seasonings) and jello. If your are like me you have no appitite at all but it is important to maintain some kind of nutrient intake. I currently take sulfasalzin 3 times a day (After each meal) when I\\'m having a flare up the only thing that brings me back is prednisone. I hope I am some help to you, and hope you get to feeling better soon.\\n\\nPlease see a Doctor!!\\n\\nTake Care --kelly smith\\n[QUOTE REMOVED]\\n\\n\\nNo Explanation needed.\\n\\nmoderator4\\nHi, I\\'m 21, was diagnosed with UC 2 years ago and have basically gone through all the stages of the disease, from diagnosis to it getting so bad that I had to spend over a month in the hospital to finally having a subtotal colectomy and pelvic pouch procedure. I hope my experience can help answer some questions for people currently going through what I have in the past.\\n\\nThroughout the course of my disease I had to try a ton of drugs including salofalk and asacol pills and suppositories, prednisone (which I was on for almost a whole year!) in pills and by IV and remicade. While some meds initially worked for me, they all eventually seemed to have no effect. But if there\\'s one thing that I can emphasize the most is don\\'t take someone else\\'s experience with a certain medication as the same way it will affect you. Everyone is different and what works for some people doesn\\'t work for others. I know a few other people with UC for whom remicade or asacol has been working great. Same thing with the side effects. I didn\\'t really experience any with the remicade, but this might be different for you.\\n\\nFor anyone with active UC I would also warn against using loppermide or imodium or any other drug like it. It was one of the biggest things my GI warned me not to do. These drugs have the same effects on your colon as narcotics and although they may provide temporary relief of having to go to the bathroom so many times a day, when they wear off, your symptoms are amplified, making you feel much worse and preventing any potential healing that\\'s going on.\\n\\nI guess the biggest piece of advice I can give to anyone who is going through UC as badly as I have is don\\'t be afraid of surgery. By no means am I saying surgery is for everyone, but if you\\'re someone like me who has tried everything else and nothing has worked, it\\'s really a life saver. I know the thought of having to have an ileostomy for a few months might seem scary, but it\\'s worth it in the long run because it gives you your life back. I just had the second surgery two months ago and feel 1000 times better. No more cramps, no more blood, no more urgency, no more letting your life be run by UC. Now I can eat whatever I want, I weigh more than 100 lbs (!) and can get back to a normal college life. Don\\'t be afraid of it and they\\'ve done these surgeries so often, healing and recovery time has been drastically cut down. 2 wks after the surgery I was feeling well enough to get back to the basics of my life. My surgeon told me there\\'s a 95% success rate, and the other 5% were people who still got rid of their UC but needed a permanent ileostomy. and when you think about it, maybe an ileostomy\\'s not all that bad compared to a lifetime of cramps, diarrhea, meds, highly restricted diets and hospital stays.',\n",

The country is a great place or say 25-30 miles outside a good size city. Somewhere that is a slower pace and not the hustle and bustle of a city. You will notice less stress and less flare ups.

I been taking Pentasa (4-4 pills A day), now last weekend I tried some spicy food last saturday & been getting Dark red blood in the toilet every since. It\\'s Almost saturday now and I been bleeding small amounts & big amounts, even sometimes none..\\n\\nWhat my worry is the blood. I\\'m taking the med\\'s everyday and Haven\\'t missed 1 day since.. I did some research online & found out about Colitis Flare up.. Can this be what\\'s happening to me?\\nAnyone????\\nMy fiance has ulcerative colitis since Aug 2008. He got better within about 2 months and after that everything went down hill again. He never missed his meds or anything. So next Tuesday the 28th he will be having his second colonscopy from a different doctor to see what is going on. And he is only 24 years old.\\nI went thru the same thing except my bleeding started in january 2007 and for 4 months i had no pain and i only bleding for about 24hrs, in april the bleeding started to last 1 to 2 days and more frequent where before it was just one day then nada, then it was every 2 weeks and i got severe abdominal pains the bleeding stopped in aug and i was okay until nov i had 1 bought of bleeding, i still have the severe pain and massive weight loss, had colonoscopy in dec and was told i had ulcertive colitis they started me on 2000mg a day of sulfasalazine it worked for about a month, then it triggered severe migraines i do have an appt with a digestive disease dr on the 30th hoping to get to the end of this i can totally relate with yu regarding the bleeding it can be very scary good luck\\nI have had UC since I was in my 30\\'s. Luckily for the last 15 years I have mostly been in remission. If you want to get it under control you have to learn what your body accepts and what it doesn\\'t. For me, the key was a high soy diet. I liiterally stopped bleeding for the first time in two years after only one week on all natural soy powder plus some digestion aides and some vitamin b complex. Your body is in a cycle  creating mucous (leading to bleeding) so your system cannot absorb the nutrients it needs to heal itself. I have done enough reading to be confused as to whether it is the malabsorption of nutrients in the first place that causes the chronic disease or if it is the result. My doctor said the predisposition is carried on a gene and you may find family members who have mild symptoms and think it is hemorroids or possibly are hiding or ignoring the condition because they are scared.\\n\\nEither way, the more nutrients you put into your diet, the better to absorb what you can so your body can do what it is supposed to do with the right ingredients. Get the best quality you can until you get it under control which will cost you some big bucks. I used true \"all natural\" products from a multi-level marketing group. I found I could back off the high cost ones eventually, but I do believe that quality makes the difference. When people say that vitamins did not make any difference I believe they are telling me they used bad oines. There are so many additives in supplements that can actually provoke your condition and lots of them are just junk anyway, don\\'t dissolve, etc. Talk to some pharmaceutical grade vitamin sellers and you\\'ll learn the pitfalls quickly. Some of the dietary  recommendations such as flax seed I found actually aggravated my condition. In fact, all seeds are not good for me including strawberry seeds (both daughters are allergic to them ,too!) The point is everyone has to find out what triggers and STOP EATING IT!. My worst episode was following a taste of fresh hot peppers from my sisters garden. Tasted great but not worth it.\\n\\nLearn how your digestive system works with all the good bacteria and how stomach acids help you digest your food and all that. Then eat with that in mind. Doesn\\'t it make sense that the more sugar you eat, the more you are creating nice breeding grounds for lovely bad bacteria not to mention lowering your infection fighting blood cells.  Yougart contains nice things for your digestion, but comes with milk so may not be good for you. Try acidophilus tablets or coated gels that ensure it gets past the acids in your stomach and into your intestine where it will eat up the nasties that make your condition worse. Learn about nutrition. High fiber products and too many raw veggies are a no-no when you are bleeding. Omega three oils should be good, but again, find out one at a time so you can stop what sends you in the wrong direction.\\n\\nI have talked to a lot of people who have Ulcerative colitis or Crohn\\'s which is a similar problem with the small intestine. You are going to be one of two types. Either 1) a victim or 2) proactive for a better life. Medicine will help you along, but the ultimate solution is to help your body heal with nutrients and stop eating the foods that trigger episodes.\\nOh, and also find out where your ulcers are located. I had them up to the trasverse colon at its worst but rarely let it get out of hand past the rectal area any more. Knowing where it is determines whether you need both oral and suppositories AND maybe even enema forms of mesalamine. If you need to use it twice a day faithfully until it heals DO It. It is worth the effort to feel your age again and not prematurely like death warmed over, not to mention the bleeding and pain.',\n",

I started drinking socially a few years ago and I have never had a problem with vomiting or stomach pains unless I drank too much.\\n\\nAbout five weeks ago, I had a late night, consuming quite a lot of drinks. The next day I was vomiting all day. This was the first time I had ever vomited the day after drinking. Then, about two weeks later, I had a good amount of drinks and the next day I was vomiting even more. I was vomiting clear and yellowish/green liquid.\\n\\nNow, whenever I drink, the next day my stomach is in excruciating pain. When I drink a lot, I always vomit.\\n\\nHas anyone experience anything like this or knows what is going on? Any input would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nNick\\n\\nNote: I couldn't find a specific thread to post this in, but if someone knows of a better place to direct me, please do. Thanks\\nthis could be just the basic 'hangover' type situation going on,OR it could be a problem with your liver.i would defintiely see your doc about this and at the very least,have him run your liver labs for you and see if there could be a possible issue there.some people actually have liver or kidney(or both) problems that in some cases are passed on from a parent that has some level of a disease or condition going onthat just never really showed itself in them but is showing up in you.i went til age 40 never actually having a clue that i was born with polycystic kidney disease with liver involvment til my son became very very ill with a huge liver problem.then i was tested and found to also have it,only not as extreme as he did.there are just different types of underlying liver and kidney conditions out there that a person can have all their life and never know about til it either presents itself(like could be occuring with you right now)or it just gets picked up during another type of CT or ultrasound where it just shows.\\n\\nsince this symptom keeps reoccuring it just really needs to be followed up on.it could just be a certain sensitivity to alcohol itslef or something in the alchol too that just does not agree with you.either way,you really should bring this to your docs attention so he can just run some simple tests on you.better safe than sorry ya know?any level of possible liver or kidney issue just really needs to be ruled out.just see your doc.good luck,hopefully this is just your particular reaction to alcohol and nothing more,but you DO need to know for sure.please let me know just what you find out,K? **\\nI was thinking more of a gastritis from the alcohol.  When it is green you are vomiting so hard that bile is coming up from your small intestine.\\n**: Thanks for the tip. I will let you know what I find out.\\n\\nSannah: Is there an easy remedy here? Will it fix its self or will I have to go to a doctor and put on antibiotics?\\n\\nThanks\\nGastritis can be from irritation so you wouldn't need an antibiotic.  If this is what is going on I would want to know why your stomach gets irritated from alcohol unless it is simply the amount of alcohol that you are consuming and then you know what you would need to do for that.\\nOK that makes sense...\\n\\nI think the amount of alcohol consumed definitely has something to do with it. When I only have a few drinks, the next day my stomach is just in pain. When I drink a lot, that is when I vomit the next day.\\n\\nIt's weird though because I had never vomited the day after drinking before a month ago, and here I have already done it three times this month.\\n\\nI was talking to one of my friends who is a pre-med student. Obviously he does not have all the knowledge a doctor would, but he thinks it could be an issue with the pH balance in my stomach. He said that it's possible that I have been drinking so much recently that my body automatically tries to compensate for the acidity of the alcohol, thus making my stomach basic. Then, the next day, when I am not drinking, my stomach is still trying to make my stomach more basic, and the pH level gets too high. I really have no idea how credible that is, but is that possible too?\\n\\nThanks for the input agian.\\nI don't know anything about that theory.\\n\\nMaybe when you drank too much the first time that your stomach got really bad, this is when you started with a gastritis and it just hasn't healed yet?  Then everytime that you drink even a little it is just too irritating because your stomach hasn't healed yet?  Maybe rest your stomach for a bit and try not to drink too much when you do drink after your stomach heals?\\nCould be pancreatitis.\\nSannah: That was my initial reaction. I have just been having trouble trying to figure out how long to wait. I waited two weeks, and then drank last weekend and the problem persisted.\\n\\nLinda: If it were pancreatitis, would I need to get treatment, or will it heal itself?\\nCan you go to the student health service and get it checked out?\\nYeah I could. Just never really trust the health center around here and I thought I would try and get some input from other people before I go in there.\\nWhy don't you trust them?\\nNot necessarily just them, but doctors in general. Sure they went to medical school and know a lot more than I do, but that doesn't always make them right. This way, I can get multiple opinions from people and then talk to the doctor.\\n\\nI agree.  You have to take your health into your own hands.  Good luck!\\nThank you and thanks for you knowledge.\",\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi ! I have posted on other threads. Here is a quick story... Had H pylori since Jan. Went thru 3 doses of triple/meds. to finally get rid of it.  I had 2 endscopies, one in Jan. one in oct. Had gastritis, esophagitis, on 2nd endoscopy Dr. said both were healing very well. ( was on acidphex, nexium, prevacid, ect. tried them all) Developed low parathryoid, low vitamin D from ??? H pylori or PPI's, drs  not sure why??? Levels normal now. Had GB out in Oct, had stones and 0% function. I was also on Zoloft for 6 months- they thought it was anxiety, but still had the pain and made me feel like a zombie so did my time as Dr. wanted but slowly weaned off and no difference in chest pain.\\nHere is problem... still have chest pain, can not find out why. Cardiac workup-  negative ( thank goodness). The pain is a squeezing,  mostly worse after eating solids, sometimes liquids too.  Sometimes feels like need to burp, relieves pain for 1 min. but pain comes back.Sometimes is very bad, makes you slightly sob, weak. rapid heartbeat. No appetite, fatigue,have lost over 30lbs. As everyone else on this site I just want my life back.... this has been almost 1 year and still no end to this chest pain.  Any help advice is  so much appreciate.... god bless.\\nHi,\\nI wanted to let you know that I also have esophageal spasms.  I get chest pain too, not sure what they come from if it is from spasms or something else.  Do you still have your chest pain?  How are you doing now?\\nmmee\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi everyone\\ni have research quite a bit and have all the textbook info, just wanted to ask some real people.  i have some severe pain in chest, am in the process of ruling out heart, lung, gastro problems.  i also have numbness on chin, lips, hand and feet.  i feel i might have to see a ortho soon, but someone suggested to me parathyroidism.  did research and seem to have alot of symptoms.  anyway, i am 40, have hypothyroidism for which i take synthroid.  recent blood work showed normal tsh.  i had radiation therapy to head and neck area 5 years ago which caused my thyroid problems. i know they are 2 seperate things, but is there any relationship between the 2.  could r/t be causing problems with my parathyroid as well,  does a normal cbc test for calcium deficiency and pth levels. any answers would be appreciated.\\nI\\'m not sure if the radiation therapy might render parathyroids nonfunctioning eventually, but if your labs show they are working, them somehow they must be.  That doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t supplement with extra calcium and see what your numb hands, etc. feel like.  When I got low calcium after surgery, popping a few Tums made that feeling do away pretty fast, like within 30 minutes.  Have you had your vitamin D levels checked?\\nkafish67,\\nHow are you making out?  Were able to eliminate some things off of your list?\\nI don\\'t think that calcium is checked with a regular cbc, because I know that my doctor ordered that separtely.  Mine came back high on Monday so I had to go back in and get the rest of the hyperparathyroid testing done.\\nLet us know how you are doing.  And I hope that helps a little.\\nWould you mind saying how high your calcium was?  Was it the normal Ca test or was it ionized Calcium?  I just had blood taken today for ionized Calcium and PTH as well as B12 and Vitamin D 25OH along with the usual TSH, FT3 and FT4.  My calcium has been high normal at 10.2 (8.5-10.5) and the Vitamin D low 19.9 (32-100) with supplements so the doctor figured it was worth checking as a lot of the symptoms are not in check with the thyroid meds yet.  Just wondering what testing you had done?  Thanks, Hoppy\\nHi, thanks for your post.\\nI am not sure yet how high it was.  I got a call from the doctor\\'s office on Monday saying that my calcium was high and she wanted to recheck it.  So, I went and had my calcium rechecked as well as ionized calcium, and pth (parathyroid hormone).  I will know this coming Monday, that is when I go to the doctors for the results of those tests and also I had to wear a heart holter monitor, so I will find out the results of everything then.  I will post them on Monday.\\nI had my thyroid checked again too, but she did not say anything about that.  I know the last time it was checked the TSH and T4 were fine, but the T3 was on the outer limits of high.\\nDo you have any symptoms, is that why yours was checked?  I have so many symptoms that have been going on for a year.  I am dizzy at times, have sinus tachycardia, vision distortions, sternum area hurts and burns all of the time, acid reflux, hypoadrenalism, myofascial pain syndrome, raynauds.  I have what seems to me as a lump in my throat.  It does seem to come and go.  I also have esphogial and diaphram spasms.  I am sure there are others, but that is all I can think of right now.-hahahaha\\n\\nI also originally had my calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus checked, but the only thing she said about was my high calcium.  Hyperparathyroid actually runs in my family on both sides.\\n\\nLet me know how you are doing and if you have any symptoms, if you don\\'t mind.  Thanks.\\nHi, I\\'m sorry it took so long to reply but I don\\'t have any answers until my appointment with the Endo next Tuesday.  All I DO know is that my calcium is high/normal, my Vitamin D is low, I have positive TPOab and TGab and I finally found an Endo who is willing to treat even with a relatively normal TSH (low FT4 and low FT3). The other symptoms of being so fatigued (sleep 3-4 hours every afternoon and all night) and extremely sore muscles/bones in hips and thighs just are not being relieved!  The other symptoms are the usual HypoT symptoms. I also have a lump in my throat but higher up (maybe a swollen lymph node?) or possibly a parathyroid in a higher than normal position (possible according to Dr. Norman).  Dr. Norman lists 18 symptoms and says most people have 3 or 4....I have 12!  This disease is known as \"moans, groans, stones and bones....with psychic overtones\".  If it isn\\'t this, I am stumped.\\n\\nI hope to hear from you after your appointment on Monday. Hoppy\\n\\ni just thought i would chime in here if you don\\'t mind.  I thought i had a parathyroid problem because when i was first diagnosed hypo and have hashi as well, the ultrasound showed an enlarged parathyroid and my pth level was high with very low vitamin d (it was 16).  At that time i also felt a lump feeling in my throat (my thyroid was also enlarged at the time), but felt like my lymph node was also enlarged.  Dr. started me on 75 mcg levothroxine, vit d supplement and cal supplement.  It took a while for my vit d level to go up to the normal range (almost a year) i am now taking 3000 mcg daily along with my thyroid med and do not have the lump feeling anymore, do not feel like my node is swollen anymore and my pth level is normal for my last two labs and my last sono did not show the enlarge parathyroid either.  My dr. is going to scan me again in 4 months, but i really think that the vitamin d deficiency had alot to do with the enlarged parathyroid.\\ngood luck\\nJennifer\\njenn3,\\nWas your calcium level high or low or normal, if you don\\'t mind me asking?\\nThanks.\\nI finally got my results about my parathyroid testing today from my doctor.  Here are the results and testing dates.\\nCalcium level:\\nAugust 2007 - 10.1\\n2 weeks ago - 10.9\\n1 week ago - 9.8 calcium, ionized calcium - 5.5 (outer most high of 5.6 considered to be normal)  and pth 36\\n\\nShe told me that I did not have parathryoid disease because my numbers fell back down.  But I have been doing alot of research on parathyroid.com by Dr. Norman and he said that that is completely normal for hyperparathyroid disease.  Plus I have 2 relatives that have this disease and it is supposedly pretty rare.  My aunt on my dad\\'s side had the disease and my great-aunt on my mom\\'s side.  She still did not blink an eye at that.  And said that she would test me again in 3 to 4 months.\\nSo, I decided to call an independent lab myself, now I have to pay for it, the insurance company will not cover it.  But I am having my calcium and ionized calcium retested.\\n\\nHas anyone else ever ran into this problem or known anyone who ran into this problem?  Please share any story about having symptoms of parathyroidism.\\n\\nThanks.\\nmmee--I believe you can also do a 24-hour urine calcium level.  It may add a new light into your picture.\\nsue1234,\\nThanks for your post.  I wanted to state an error that I made.  My ionized calcium was 5.5, not 3.5.  Sorry for the mistake.',\n",

       " {'post': 'I am wondering if anyone can help me. Thyroid problems run in my family, with my dad having Hashitoxicosis. I have thought something was off for awhilw now. Within the past 2 months though I have deveopled anxiety as well as light depression. I have difficulty getting to sleep and when I do sleep i never seem rested. I have also lost close to 20 pounds in the past 2 months. When all of this first started happening back in late December I went to a family Dr. Who tested my thyroid and that was it. Gave me drugs for anxiety and sent me on my way. I received a letter a week later saying all test came back in the normal range. With that news I thouhgt maybe this is normal and how my life is going to be...but I know better. This is not me and this came about out of the blue. Since then I have lost more weight. I am a small women anyway and to drop 17-20 pounds is alarming. I go back to another Dr. next week and am going to request further testing. Is it possible to have thyroid problems but tests come back normal? I just do not know where else to turn. I am tired of felling like I am going crazy. Can anyone with any advise help me? I would like to know exactly what I need to tell my doc to request for testing.\\n\\nAdvise please!!!!\\n\\nMake sure that they check your adrenals as well, addison\\'s disease (and other causes of low cortisol) can produce similar symptoms.\\nThanks for that advise. I will ask about info on that on my next appointment.\\nAsk for free T-3, Free T-4 and tsh. Then ask for a copy of labs, just don\\'t let them say normal, also you might ask for a TSI test  to see if you have antibodies for Graves disease. Also with a dad with both hashi and graves, you no doubt have an autoimmune thyroid problem, I would guess. Do you have a racing heart and tremor of the hands too? Frequent bm\\'s and a big appetite, but you still lose weight?\\nEarly Hashi\\'s has hyperT times as well.  So toss that in the blood pot o tests we are recommending.  ACTH and cortisol is a good idea, along with TSH, FT3, FT4, T3 Uptake, Hashi\\'s antibodies (TPOAb and TGAb), Graves tests (TSI and TRAb). And.. humm.. Have you tested your ferritin, D, B12, and magnesium levels?\\n\\n\\nThat will cover your basis.\\n\\nMG\\nThanks for everyones feedback. I have printed out all of your comments and advise! I go on Tuesday for my appointment with my family doc. I will keep you informed for sure. I will note though that I do take a multi vitamen everyday along with a magneseuim pill 3 times a day? And it seems to help...Does anyone know why the magnesium seems to help ease the anxiety? I do have just a slight tremble in the hands as well, not to much. My appetitire is pretty normal...although when the anxiety is full blown I can not eat at all. Despite the eating I am still loosing the pounds....I amunder 100 now. Hopefully I will get answers soon. thanks for your help and support\\n\\nmarcy27,\\nHi, I was wondering how you made out with your testing.  I have all of the exact same symptoms.  I was diagnosed with hypoadrenalism and put on natural supplements by my doctor to bring them back to normal, but I still feel lousy: rapid heart rate and all of the other things.  I too think that I have a thyroid condition, but I am waiting for the most recent tests to come back to see.  I also have to go in for a holter monitor on Monday to make sure it is not my heart. I have already been through the cardio workup before.  All was fine. This all happened for me out of the blue too, last Feb 2007.  It was like one day I was fine and the next day (and ever since) life has been almost unfunctionable.  I hope that you can find out what is wrong.  I too was put on anti-anxiety drugs, which helped me forget about things for awhile but it never took away my symptoms.  Then I was diagnosed with myofascial pain also so they kept me on the klonopin for a muscle relaxer.  Somedays I don\\'t know which way to turn.  I am thankful that I found this board.  Let us know how you make out.\\nThanks.\\nHi marcy and mmee.  I empathize with how you feel.  I have similar symptoms and my TSH came back normal too.  I haven\\'t yet had any more extensive testing than that.  But I know that something just isn\\'t right in my body hormonally.  Sometimes I feel calm and great for weeks or months and then out of nowhere my body changes and my heart pounds and skips, i lose weight, i get highly anxious, and my whole body just feels \"charged\" or adrenaliney.\\n\\nI\\'ve had my symptoms off and on for 15 years and never had extensive testing.  I just want to know what it is that causes my body physiology to shift so dramatically.\\n\\nLet us know what your blood work finds.  I\\'ll be curious to hear.\\nHi timber,\\nI know exactly what you mean.  Somedays it is better than others and there is no one thing I can pin point to bring on or keep symptoms away.\\n\\nMy doctor called me on Monday and apparently my calcium level did come back high.  So, I had to go back and get some more blood work done, calcium, ionized calcium, and parathyroid hormone.  I will know the results of those tomorrow.  I guess she is leaning towards hyperparathyroidism now, but we will see.  It actually does run in my family on both sides.\\n\\nShe did not say anything about my thyroid tests, so I guess that they came back okay, but I will find out tomorrow.\\n\\nI will post my bloodwork when I find it out tomorrow.\\nAlso- did you ever have your calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels checked for hyperparathyroid?  My understanding is that that is not something that is normally checked unless there is a reason.\\nHi marcy27,\\nI was just wondering how you made out at the doctor\\'s and if you found out anything new?\\nI have alot of the same symptoms as you do and this week I just found out that my calcium level is high and I had to be retested.  I will find out more tomorrow, the results.\\nDid you have your calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels checked for hyperparathyroid?\\nAlot of the symptoms that I am having is listed for hyperparathyroid too.  You can look up the symptoms at parathyroid.com and see if you are having any of those symptoms too.\\n\\nLet us know how you make out.\\nI finally got my results about my parathyroid testing today from my doctor. Here are the results and testing dates.\\nCalcium level:\\nAugust 2007 - 10.1\\n2 weeks ago - 10.9\\n1 week ago - 9.8 calcium, ionized calcium - 5.5 ( with the outer most limit of high being 5.6 in the normal range) and pth 36\\n\\nShe told me that I did not have parathryoid disease because my numbers fell back down.

down? he wont get better til this passes. is there other docs or a different hospital that you can take him to?\\n\\nmy son had a feeding tube down his nose for quite a few weeks to give him plain nutrition in place of not eating any food,along with heavy duty IV antibiotics. honestly, i am as confused as you are about your dads treatment. are they at least giving him something for the pain?\\n\\nwhile i do know that with pancreatitis,you do have to kind of just \"ride it out\\',it does take time,what i DON\"T understand is why his docs do not have him back in the hospital \"riding it out\" where he will at least have the NG tube back and be getting good nutrition. not to mention just good pain management. thats just not right at all. to send a patient who they KNOW is not able to actually keep anything down home is pretty sick actually.\\n\\nif i were you,in this situation,i would just keep calling and calling the docs and bugging the living heck out of them til they just DO the right thing here for your dad. from what you have stated about his symptoms and current condition,he could really honestly starve to death while just \\'riding this out\" at home. he simply is not getting what the body needs everyday just to sustain life. either keep calling his docs til someone \\'gets it\\' OR just take him back to the ER of the hospital he was at and have them check all his current labs and have him rehydrated and simply ask them,\"do YOU  honestly think it is okay for a man in his condition to actually be at home right now\"? this just doesn\\'t sound right at all to me either and you have every reason to be concerned if nothing has changed with your fathers condition and they sent him home like this.\\n\\ni would really just take him back to the ER or even try a different hospital if this one will not do the right thing and just admit him asap. but he DOES need to be in a hospital right now for treatment. he just NEEDS to really be there if he cannot actually eat or drink fluids. geez,these docs are really unreal.\\n\\njust keep in mind that you ARE in the right here and i would push anyone(docs,hospital)you have to just to get him readmitted. just don\\'t take NO for an answer when you know you are trying to do the best possible thing for anyone and you know its the right thing to do. i have had to push docs and nurses and other \\'medical professionals\\' during my sons illnesses and with my medical stuff too. sometimes you just HAVE TO speak loudly and push people into simply doing the right thing. sad but true.\\n\\ni really do wish you lots of luck with this. one really big help to you and your father would be to really research the heck out of the proper way to treat pancreatitis,which you are doing right now. but being able to counter anything any doc says to you that you know is not true with actual facts will get your needs met much more quickly,believe me. this is what i had to do with my and my sons conditions. just understand fully what you are dealing with and the PROPER treatment options availiable,then hit them hard. the docs simply cannot argue the facts. once they know that you are aware,it will make a big difference in how your fathers treatment is. but he REALLY needs to be back in hospital sooner vs later.\\n\\nplease keep me posted as to how things go. i really do hope they will just re admit him and get him better soon. you DO have \\'right\\' on your side. good luck, **\\nthankyou so very much for your reply i really truly apreciate it.  Its so nice to finally ask questions and have someone answer them.\\nfirstly i am sorry to hear that about your son that would have been very hard to see your son go through.  i hope he has no problems now.\\ni really think i willl have to push because to be honest i feel like my father will starve to death or it will be too late if you know what i mean.  Today on his menu was \"NOTHING\" a half a cup of water which not much sooner than he drank it, it came back up.\\nMy Mum took him back to his old GP today because she is so worried about him as well.  this dod has been his doc for 25 odd years so knows him well.  the first thing he said was \"what the hell have you done to yourself\"  now if that isn\\'t a sign that this man is incredibly ill then i don\\'t know what is.  this doc too said that as long as he is trying to eat then being at home in his own environment is best for him.  okay i believe that to some degree but Dad is scared.  he is scared of the inevitable.  they have given him some medication oxi\"something\" that is morphine based.  his doc today told him to drop all tablets.  he usually suffers high blood pressure and takes medication for that as well and has been told to drop them as well as his BP is 98/52 which to me seems way too low?!?!?!?!?!?\\nwhilst he was in hospital they were giving him a high protein drink through his tube and he slowly seemed to getting more colour again back in his face and perked up again but now he looks even worse than before except he says the pain is not as bad.  on his ultrasound at the hospital they first noted his pancreas was etremely enlarged, then about 10 days later they came to him and said that about 1/3 of his pancreas had died.  his blood sugar levels have been perfect so far we can rule out diabetes although th docs have said that the pancreas will probably just fall off and he will pass it.  are you serious? is this really how they treat it?  i just don\\'t understand.  i walked in to his room at the hospital and the nurse was getting angry at him because he couldn\\'t walk and she was saying he needs to motivate himself, i just looked at her with tears in my eyes and pleaded to just let him rest for the day.  he is so weak and i know he needs to keep his lungs sufficient and all that but he just has no energy.\\nat the hospital he was on IV antibioics and a drip right up until the hour they sent him home. he can hardly hold a conversation, his attention span seems to sway.  he looks almost straight through you at stages as if he isn\\'t even there\\ni am driving up to see him first thing in the morning and i will assess him again and may even pack his bags and get him back down the hospital.\\ni will keep you informed and thankyou yet again.\\nJodestar,  I have had pancreatitis twice.  Both times my white blood count was extremely high.  They admitted me to hospital both times.  Stayed about a week on pain meds and the first few days nothing by mouth.  Not even water.  Then they introduced clear liguids, like broth, italian ices etc then gradually soft food as in pudding, jello etc,  Did you know a person can become septic with a bout of pancreatitis?  If he is still this sick, he must go back to ER.  That is a low and scary blood pressure.  I wonder if there is any underlying problems?  Did they do any tests,  I had a test done that showed my spincter wasn\\'t working and I needed a stent placed in the pancreas.  I will tell you that the pain is horrendous!  Worse than child birth\\nTell them to check his blood again, especially his liver enzyes, and his digestive enzyes.  When you have pancreatitis, your white blood count goes through the roof due to the infection and inflammation.  I hope he has a very good internest or gastro doctor.  Ask for the best doctor there.   Good luck to you dad and please check out the ER again.  By the way, how do you pass a bit of dead pancreas?  That just doesn\\'t make sense.\\nThis is absolutely in the \"for what it\\'s worth\" category as I have nothing to offer otherwise than \"pressure the medical professionals to do their jobs and actually provide some help\" but here goes:\\n\\nIn the early 90s, the actor Michael Landon was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Since the pancreas does the job of producing the enzymes used for digestion (along with the liver), when it\\'s not doing its job well the digestion is minimal or nonexistent. Anyway, I digress. Michael Landon chose to appear on\\nto discuss his condition and prognosis. He looked good. He mentioned that he was drinking papaya juice. My guess is that he was doing that on the advice of some of the best in the business at that time, and that papaya juice is able to nourish you and/or stay down better when your pancreas is compromised.\\n\\nI had a bad bout of\\na few years back and I believe pancreatitis was a part of it ... I used an Epsom Salt/Olive Oil flush and it worked, but it could be too rough to try on him.\\nunbelieveable that his doc did not actually direct him straight back to the hospital. stupid really. if he cannot simply hold down food or fluids,THAT in and of itself is a very real immediate threat to his life,he WILL simply starve to death at home. he is not getting what he needs there and has to be admitted just to at least get him proper nutrition and prevent other possible complications from developing. you are very right about him possibly getting some level of lung issues too in his debilitated state. if he is not actually moving enough to fully expand and the deflate his lungs,he can very easily end up with some level of pneumonia. his body systems are very much being compromised right now. his kidneys very much if he is not able to take in and keep fliuds down. this is where the constantly running IV in the HOSPITAL really helps. it keeps the body hydrated and the kidneys running normally. he just needs sooo many things he simply cannot get at home right now.\\n\\nif i were you,i would gather him up and present him to the local ER just like he is and you tell them everything he is NOT doing,like eating and keeping it down? his blood vessels will also start to collapse without proper hydration. he really just NEEDS to be in the flippin hospital right now til he can at least keep food and fluids down. they just never ever should have sent him home in that state. never.\\n\\ni would really start demanding things be done at this point,you are done being nice and waiting. this just can become(if not already) a very major serious situation being he has been like this for so long already. i would not leave that ER til they agree to admit him. stand your ground,you ARE on the side of right here and i would push it as far as i could go at this point. sometimes we just have to advocate for the people we care about when we KNOW they are not being given proper care. this whole situation just never should have happened. i wish you tons of luck with this. keep pushing til you get your dads needs met. thats the best possible advice i can give you. this is what i have had to do many times for me and my son. you just ARE doing the right thing here. please keep us posted. now go kick some medical a**. **\\nwow thankyou all so much for your kind words and support.  you will all be happy to know that i went over to my Dad\\'s this morning, packed his bags and took him to the ER.  there i sat for 4 hours until they took him in and gave him a bed.  he is still in the ER and hopefully by the morning will have his own room.  i hate our hospital system here!!!!! i know it is not the docs and nurses fault but seriously it is appalling.  but he is in and hopefelly will get the strength and nutrients in to his body to fight this horrible disease.  i had to leave him to come home to my 3 year old twins who i can honestly say are the only things giving him the will to live at the moment.\\nthankyou to each and every one of you and i will keep posted with his progress.\\ngreat job! really,you just simply HAD TO do what you did. he was not going to get any better at home,just worse til they really just couldn\\'t \\'do\" for him anymore,you know what i mean? you definitely did the right thing in taking him back there. hopefully they will now do \"their\" right thing.\\n\\njust a bit of advice here for ya, if all this has been going on and you really don\\'t know a whole lot about just what his actual condition was or even is right now,just have him sign a release so you can obtain ALL of his ongoing medical records. this would be the very best way for you to see just how he is doing per what the docs wrote about him and the nursing notes too. these very important hospital records would also tell you just exactly what his overall condition was like when these idiots actually sent him home before. this info really needs to be gone thru by you. if you cannot understand something,either look it up in one of the medical info sites or post it here and i will or someone else will try and help you out with that. i would really like to know just what in gods name these people(alleged medical professionals??) were actually thinking when they sent him home despite the fact he was not yet even able to keep food down. it was just sooo incredibly stupid and could have resulted in some pretty dire consequences for your dad.\\n\\ntrust me,you did the best possible thing for him by taking him back there. hopefully they will help him this time around. if they screw up again or he seems to not be getting the proper care,speak up for him and demand better. OR you do have an option hopefully of pulling him out and having him transferred to a better hospital? don\\'t know that situation,but it could be a last resort option if things go badly again.\\n\\nwhat that hospital did really was appalling and you had every right to be angry and very concerned. it was just way too soon yet for him to be out. you ARE a really great son by the way. please keep us posted as to how things are going with your dad jode. now that he will be getting his real needs met, i am hoping this will all be over soon and he can be back with his grand babies soon. sounds like you have your hands full there too,lol. just keep a close eye on how things are going at that hospital and get those records too. you really need to know just what his real medical status was when these putzes sent him home knowing he could not keep things down, yikes. take care jode,  **\\nI have had pancreatitis twice in 5 years and I now have high enzymes again and probably have it again.  My pancreatitis was due to being allergic to my high-blood presure meds.  I can take them for about 1 year almost to the day before I start having syptoms (itchy red palms of hands, bottoms and tops of feet, top of the head usually starts two weeks prior to the pain in the gut).  There is no cut and dry to pancreatitus.  You need it to survive as I\\'ve been told.  The first two times I had it they hospitalized me for several days. (IV\\'s and nothing going into the mouth) So, I\\'m trying the no solids only clear liquids to see if my enzyme levels will go down.  Bottomline: Your pancreas needs a rest.  I hope this has helped. Or if any of you have suggestions for me, please post.  Thanks ziggidrooper\\njust thought i would post an update to the kind people who gave me advice.  my Dad is still in hospital.  after he was readmitted to hospital he went down hill very very fast!!!!!!!! he couldn\\'t eat or drink ANYTHING and he didn\\'t have a nose feed in so was not receiving any nutrients.  they did a few more scans on my Dad and it was late found there was a mass which they found although they could not locate the exact position of the mass except they could see it was near the bowel. After a colonoscopy the mass showed up it was cancer.  two days later my Dad was in for surgery!!!!!!!  when they opened him they were given alot of surprises!!!!! the cancer mass was alot larger then expected.  we were praying he would not need a bag and he had a one in ten chance of not having to have one.  13 hours waiting in ICU and he was finally wheeled back to his room where we were told they had to give him two bags.  he had a 11cm mass of cancer in his bowel through his large and small intestine, his secum has been removed and part of the colon.  and to top it off he had a fluid mass of 200ml on his pancreas which burst during the surgery which just added to the madness as he then had acids going through his blood.\\nsince the operation we have had many days when we thought we would be saying goodbye to Dad,  he started vomiting black coffee granules which was a sure sign of internal bleeding.  he became annorexic and aneamic (sp?).  they gave him a blood transfusion and he had 6 units of blood (1500ml) so far.  two units of plasma to thicken his blood and now has a pick line for protein.  the last few days i have seen the biggest turn around with Dad.  he is no longer grey and has managed to put weight on over noght. even though he is puffy because it is fluid retention at least he doesn\\'t look gaunt anymore.  we are still waiting on the biopsy results and we know he has to have chemo now which is meant to start this week but he is still too week because of his pancrreatitus.  he also still has a bleed in his pancreas.  they gave him an angiagram but could not locate the bleed/leak.  his doctor wants to try again because they want to avoid surgery at all costs.  he is losing between 200ml - 350ml of blood a day.\\nwe are still staying positive and just taking every day as it comes.  i have never felt so helpless and cried so many tears in my life.  My Dad has been in hospital for 8 weeks now since his first admission and only now have i seen any improvement.  he is black and blue with bruises from all of his needles, drains and drips but we have to keep moving forward.  we still have a looooooong road to recovery and no doubt still a few hurdles to jump but fingers crossed they aren\\'t as hard as the last three weeks.\\ni wish you all the best.  who ever would have thought eight weeks ago when my Dad was taken to hospital with what we thought was food poisoning would end up being like this.\\nthanks for reading sometimes it helps just to get it out\\nJodestar\\n',\n",

There is a lot of good info on this site. parathyoid.com\\n\\nEdited to say calcium should be between 8.5 and 10.4.\\nNo, that's the PTH range - and the high end of the scale is age-dependant.

       " {'post': 'Greetings,\\n\\nI have a pain in my side that is not constant.  What separates it from some symptoms guides I have read is that it is extreme right side, not toward the abdomen, not toward the back.  Exactly between the hip and ribs, and straight in line with the shoulder.  Or, following a line from the shoulder if the arms are in the position of a soldier standing at attention.\\n\\nThe pain is a shooting/stabbing pain that varies in intensity.  It feels just a little bit like a contraction, like something is shortening.  The only cause for alarm in my mind is because some times it is so severe that it has literally dropped me to my knees.\\n\\nDoctor has sent me for kidney ultrasound with no obvious outcome.\\n\\nDoes anyone have any ideas what this might be?  What lies in the particular area that may cause that kind of sharp pain?\\nGallbladder.\\nRight sided pain, sort of between right flank and right abdominal pain, described as shooting/stabbing with a contraction/wave-like quality could be from multiple causes ... one of them being kidney stones .. but why the ultrasound .. U/S rarely actually visualizes a nephrolithiasis(kidney stone), for the most part it would be useful in assess the genitourinary tract for signs of obstruction from a kidney stone, not necessarily the stone(s) in question; ultrasound can best visualize the size of your kidneys, but more importantly the size of the renal pelvices(the area where the ureters attach to the kidneys) -- if these are dilated/enlarge(hydronephrosis) would suggest that something is blocking of the ureter(s)/bladder, U/S can also look at the size of the ureters(the tubes attaching the kidneys to the bladder) and if they are enlarged(hydroureter) that would suggest that there is a stone in one(or both - rare) of the ureters, ultrasound can also look at the size of the bladder, if that\\'s enlarged it would suggest that somethings not letting your bladder empty(but if it were a stone, you\\'d wouldn\\'t be able to pee and would be in bad shape)\\n\\nideally if you MD were worried about a stone, they would get a non-contract stone protocol CT(maybe a abdominal x-ray, but some stones are not visible on x-ray) .. by the way, did you have a urinalysis checked\\n\\nbut in terms of other sources of pain, there are other causes to consider .. any history of intra-abdominal surgeries ??? , you can have fibrosis of the retroperitoneum that could give you these symptoms ... gallbladder pain(e.g biliary colic) could do it ... would be quite an atypical appendicitis picture ... could have inflammation of some of your intrabdominal lymph nodes(lymphadenitis) ... an atypical diverticulitis picture .. some sort of nerve entrapment(compression of one of the intercostal nerves might cause this pain) or some sort of early mononeuritis multiplex or neuropathy, heck this could even be early \"shingles\" -- any rash in that area\\n\\nbest of luck\\nThanks for the responses.  I\\'ll see if I can shed more light.\\n\\n\\nThis reminds me.  For several years when I was younger, late teens to late twenties I used to experience small chunks in the urine.  Generally no pain but if they didn\\'t make it all out before the end of stream flow some would stay in my urethra, dry up and hurt.  I eventually found the solution was just to drink lots of water when this happened.  I also had a report of prostatitis then for which I was recommded zinc supplements.  Never been able to determine the trouble precisely, but since the right side pain began I don\\'t believe I\\'ve had one instance of the stuff passing.  It was rather chalky when it dried and could be broken between the fingers like dust when dry.\\n\\n\\nI do frequently urinate.  Well, if I am on my way to bed I\\'ll stop at the bathroom downstairs, then go upstairs and have to go again, and usually one more time before falling asleep and maybe once in the night.  Otherwise everything goes well in the daytime.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t believe it was done with the pain symptoms.  So no, not recently.\\n\\n\\nNo surgeries there, no rash in the area.  Has carried on for some time.  Unpredictable.  I do have scoliosis so the ribs are affected and I believe they are expanded on the right side so the last rib is closer to the hip than on the left side.  But I am well aware of typical muscle pain and have pulled muscles between the ribs weight lifting in the past.  THis is below that, but I wouldn\\'t rule anythin out.\\ngalbladder or appendix\\nRegarding gallbladder the first thing to note is that I am not in any of the risk groups.\\n\\nAs for symptoms, my pain is directly on the side, not toward the fron.  If I lay down on my left side in the fetal position, the part that hurts would be pointing straight into the air, or zulu.  I talked to someone with gallbladder and they said theirs hurt in the front, but radiates to the back.  Mine is neither, it is dead on the side.  If you drew an imaginary line through the pain, it would be parallel to my shoulders from left to right.\\n\\nThird, the doctor who saw me never mentioned gallbladder, but he did suggest pancreatitis.  Again I don\\'t really follow in that risk group or have other symptoms.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, I have been having similar symptoms but much milder on the left side now which is making me think either kidney or colon.\\n\\nAny ideas?  Do these seem to collor diverticulitis, Crohn\\'s or IBS?\\nsome galbladder dont hurt right where it is\\nthere is so many things it could be\\ni hope you find the answer',\n",

The blood tests came back fine but the stool sample came back showing high calprotectin levels so I was referred to a gastroenterologist.

       " {'post': \"I have been taking metoprolol 25 mg for a couple of months. I would split it in two and take one in the morning and one at night. Recently I asked dr if I could cut dosage in half. He said yes. Well, it is impossible to cut 1/2 pill in 1/2. I have the pill splitter with the v in it that holds the pill. It is a small pill. Even cutting it in half is not accurate. To cut half in half-I have to use a razor blade and it is not accurate. I was at the dr on Monday to check my bp. I told him it is hard to do. I asked should I go back to taking 12.5mg in the morning and again at night. He said no. I am hoping to stop taking this bp med and to avoid taking any other. Trying to eat right and exercise. He did ask if I would want to try another bp med like Coreg. Is that a smaller dosage med? I go back in June for bp check. Any help on how do you split small pills?\\nThanks! Pam\\nIs the drug available in a 12.5 mg pill?  I agree, it's difficult to cut a small pill accurately especially if it isn't scored.  Maybe your Dr. could prescribe it in a 12.5 dosage.\\n\\nAs for comparing mg and different meds, it's impossible to do as far as I know.\\nFor example, I take 20 mg of Lisinopril but my atenolol pill is 100 mg.  You just can't equate the two mg-wise.  I'm not sure if I'm making myself clear or not.\\n\\nI hope you get everything straightened out.\\nIt is not available in 12.5 mg pill. I don't know why dr suggested Coreg. I thought maybe it was because it came in a smaller dose.\\nI will find out more next month. Thanks!\\nHi Pemmy,\\n\\nI've had to split a lot of pills including some very tiny ones.  Here's what I do.\\n\\nI use a very thin vegetable knife & wax paper.  The knife comes in a package of 4 usually & is found most likely in one of the aisles at the grocery store or where the gadgets are.\\n\\nCut a piece of wax paper a little larger than the pill so that you can divide the paper into 4 pieces.  On another piece of wax paper, place the pill.  Put the whole thing on a dry cutting board.\\n\\nI just tried cutting the brand name of your drug, Toprol.  I found after cutting it in half that it is best to cut  the half piece in half again sideways not the longer way.  This is a small oval shaped pill so hopefully yours is similar.\\n\\nYou'll get better at doing this the more you actually do it.  By putting the pill on wax paper, you can get all the grains of medicine.  If one piece is larger than the other, take the large piece for your AM dose.  Then you can take the smaller one for the evening dose when your b/p is lower anyhow because you will be sleeping.  You can use applesauce or custard to gather any grains of medicine left on the wax paper.\\n\\nCarefully wrap the other 3 portions of the tablet & put it in a closed medicine bottle or other dry container.\\n\\nThis method has worked well for me for the past 5 yrs as I have gotten off some difficult drugs.\\n\\nExplaining this is difficult-let me know if you have questions.  Fam\\nThanks Fam! I will try your suggestion. The metoprolol is round. Maybe small as a baby aspirin or about that size.  Pam\\nHope it works for you.  Clonidine was my hardest drug to withdraw from.  The pill is a little smaller than a baby aspirin.  It took two months & two tries.\\n\\nBe sure & hold the pill on both sides with your thumb & index finger as you cut.  I find pressing down with the knife works better than a sawing motion.  Fam\\nThanks Famd for the extra tips! What bp med are you on now? I think I have read some of your other posts but can't remember any on that.

Talk about being nervous. Wonder if my bp went up! Thanks again!\\nI'm on 25mg HCTZ (diuretic) & 1800mg Lebetalol (an alpha/beta blocker.)\\n\\nI'm waiting until August to have a parathyroid level done because that's when I see my Endo.   My highest calcium was 10.5.   I see the E & T Doc & have a ultrasound in October so I have to have all my ducks in a row in case my nodules have grown.  There's a blood test for an adrenal tumor that I had thought one Dr. had done but he didn't order it even though he made note of the need to do that in his notes.\\n\\nI got called for Jury duty once but I was nursing my last baby so I wasn't about to leave my baby.  It would be interesting to do jury duty but with my labile b/p I don't think my Dr. would vote for it.  I was asked to testify for a case involving my daughter's car accident but I was called right when I started getting hypertensive so I told the lawyer he could use our phone conversation but I would have to pass on the court room part of it.

       " {'post': \"im a 22 year old female and have been having severe bowel problems for nearly 3 years! it started that id have around 13-16 BMs per day/night, always diarrhea, severe stomach cramps, extreme nausea right up until recently where id now have 4-8 BMs (around 12 on 'bad day') sometimes with a lot of blood and mucus upon wiping. often it wakes me during the night, I have also lost a lot of weight, sick a lot and in severe pain everyday. everyday is a struggle as I have to be at home due to having a phobia of using other peoples toilets! I still have constant diarrhea, and went to see my GP who did some bloodwork. My inflammation levels have steadily been rising and he referred me to a gastroenterologist (confident that I have crohns or colitis) the GI did a colonoscopy and a gastroscopy. they took biopsies and photos but said everything looked normal! im sick of them making me look like a fool. maybe I should just accept that I have ibs (although no ibs medications have worked) im just so frustrated, sore and tired of it all! is it still possible that I have crohns or colitis??\\nAre you taking a product like metamucil 2-3 times a day?\\n\\nDoes Imodium help?\\n\\nI know how you feel. I've had IBS for several years now.\\n\\nBest of luck to you.\\nI cant take Metamucil as im on lithium and they interact with each other.\\nImodium makes me soil myself.. my doctor just told me theres nothing they can do, its so frustrating. but thanks, best of luck to you too.\\nHi,\\nYou know your symptoms seem to be the exact same ones as my 17 yr old son.  Do you also have a lot of Anxiety?  That certainly can aggravate what's going on.  My son had both the Endoscopy and the Colonoscopy and the results were Gastritis.  We've tried a few different meds, added some, they made it worse, then changed them with another, then told us he needed to take one in the morning and one at night.  He's STILL having problems.  His pain wakes him up in the middle of the night too and yes he's also had blood in his stool and also has thrown blood up.\\nThis has really started to scare me.  Ok so anyway the next step was to swallow that pill that's a camera and we find out the results on the 27th.  Only a few days to go.  I changed his follow up  appt because he was still in so much pain, but we have to still wait because the results haven't come back yet.  Waiting is the worst!\\nShe had originally tested him for everything under the sun.  Celiac, Lactose, Fruitose, H Pylori, you name it, it came back negative.  In the mean time they said write out a food diary so maybe we can also figure out about his diet.\\nThe poor kid, he can get a stomach ache first thing in the morning and all he's had is some water.  I don't buy crap like Soda, juice etc.  He only drinks water or milk.  He'll occasionally have a soda  with friends, but that's really only once in a while when they go to Mc D's after school.  He's already thin, and I'm worried he'll lose more weight.  So trust me, I understand it.  You must be feeling awful.  If I were you I would get a second opinion.  Your Doctor up there missed something.  I'm gonna try and help my son with his anxiety because I know it makes it worse, but we might have to put him on meds for that too... Good luck!  I hope you feel better.\\n\",\n",

I was then told I had to have my appendix removed and I had to sign a paper to say I give them permission to take my ovary out if need be. The doctor also told me I might have Crohs disease. Anyway I had the surgery and they only took my appendix. They never mentioned anything about my ovary and colon after and to be honest I was that high on morphine that I forgot to ask. I know it was two years ago but I still get pain every now and then where my right ovary is and where my appendix used to be. Does anyone know if it could be Crohn's disease?

So they sent me home and about a week later I felt fine and went back to my normal life.\\nOn Jan 29th I woke up feeling horrible dogestion and my back and shoulder was hurting. This lasted all day. After dinner it satrted to feel worse so I went to lay down and all of a sudden I had horrible chest pain. My heart was beating fast and I was getting this overwhelming feeling of doom over and over again. I went to the er. Ekg and xray came back normal. Blood work was fine except my white cell count was 19. Bp was 180/75 then 159/75. So they sent me home and told me to follow up with my doctor. I went to my doctor and she concluded acid reflux because I told her it felt like food was stuck in my throat and my chest hurt. She also said I was having anxiety and reffered me to a therapist. And prescribed me omeprazole. Oh yeah my resting heart rate has been anywhere from 89 to 95 to 100. Walking around my house cleaning or even getting a drink of water and it goes up to 115 to 120. But she said my heart sounds fine and ordered a stress test ( I will have in a month).\\nSo its been 2 weeks since the er visit and nothing has changed. My heart rate is still high\\nI have had mustard color and texture diarrhea for a week and today it's bloody now. My stomach hurts bad on the top. When I eat my whole chest hurts and my throat. I have to sleep propped up or stomach acid will come up and I keep waking up every little while because my arms feel like they're burning.\\nI had a consultation with a gi yesterday they ordered a ct scan ( i will have in two weeks) , and an endoscopy and colonoscopy ( i will have in a month).\\nMy doc prescribed me anxiety meds because this is stressing me out so bad. What if I have colon cancer? Or stomach cancer? Heartfailure? Heart disease? I don't know. I am starting to feel depressed.\\nSounds like you might have a stomach ulcer. Try activia and other probiotics, cooked veggies like spinach and carrots... maybe carrot and spinach juice if possible? After it heals keep taking probiotics like kefir or organic yogurt to fight the candida and other bacteria/fungi that causes ulcers and go to an allergist to see what foods via blood test you are allergic to. They will also test for celiac disease. And when they do the endoscopy/colonoscopy they will take samples and test for H. Pylori. Hope all goes well.\",\n",

Drugs can suppress symptoms but as you know, they can not cure the under-lying problem. We need to, and can, create a balanced and healthy environment for the organs to settle down and do their job. Genetics can't be changed, but we can change how we treat the body. Inflammation comes from an unhealthy environment. We can change the internal environment so the body can function as stress free as possible.\\n\\nI am not at all against drugs, but also, by my own experience and research don't believe drugs or herbs (really used as just another drug) can create the needed gut balance. And, as you know, drugs and herbs also can have seriously bad side effects. For example, antibiotics can save a life from a bad infection, but ruin the healthy gut balance. So we need to understand the gut and how to help it be as healthy as possible.\\n\\nThere are things we can do to help heal the inflammation. One is to read up on how to create a healthy gut environment. Read all sorts of opinions. Also, you can interview some Naturopathic Doctors, and explain your genetic diseases and that you need help to get your gut as healthy as possible. Then try one out. If he/she doesn't help, try a different one. Docs are just people, and they don't all have the same interests or study.\\n\\nThere are foods that by what you wrote, definitely your own gut cannot process to your benefit. I can't tell you specifically what substances inflame\\ngut, but you really must change how you think about food and how it affects your body. There are highly inflammatory 'foods' and chemicals like alcohol (which is highly concentrated fruit sugar) that someone with an 'iron' gut can handle, but people like you and I (I have my own gut issues) need to avoid as if they are a plague.\\n\\nWe can think of how we choose to eat that we have a deadly allergy. We would not deliberately eat poison if we knew it was poison to us, right? Well, certainly that isn't a fact, because we humans frequently ingest things that aren't at all good for us (like spun sugar...I love cotton candy). But I believe you can help our bodies lay the inflammation to rest. I can do it myself, when I make myself do it. It isn't easy, though, to pass by a pot pie. I think of the veggies inside the pie and ignore that the pie includes wheat pie crust. Clearly plain vegetables are not esp. appealing. But herbs and sauces and real butter can make them delectable. (If I seem to be trying to convince myself, I am.) Knowing what to do is one thing. Doing it is another. But I and you need to get serious, and I don't have the disease you have. Both of us still need to take our health more seriously.\\n\\nOne thing I know we need to avoid is simple carbs. Simple carbs are known to cause inflammation in the gut. It kill the healthy flora balance. This includes most grains, breads, cereals, sugars, syrups, and the list goes on. Yet there are sugars and grains that don't inflame the body. We have to learn what those are, and to cook differently. We need to eat whole fresh foods, fruits, vegetables, low fat cuts of meat, chicken, etc. and NEVER indulge in pre-prepared or artificial food. It takes several stomachs for grass eating animals to process grass (wheat is a grass). Yet some 'super-intelligent' person got the idea to raise grass products for food. And they taste so good! But may not be good for the human body.\\n\\nI confess, those pre-prepared cake, pie and bread type of foods are attractive. But if we want the gut to heal and function right we have to change what we put in to it.\\n\\nI am pretty sure this isn't info that one wants to know. As I share with you I am convicted of my own crimes toward myself.\",\n",

I was initially diagnosed with a codeine allergy but that was before I recognised the correlation between red meat/chicken and the pain I was experiencing.\\n\\nSince then, I have merely stood clear of red meat and chicken. Things do get a little strange from here though...\\n\\nI've had major depressive disorder since around the age of 15 (I'm 30 now) and had just come off Mirtazapine when I began having the intense pains. I was off antidepressants until the beginning of 2014 then cycled through Mirtazapine, Pristiq, Prozac, Endep and then onto Valdoxan late 2015. Intense anxiety attacks and a mental breakdown very late 2016 meant an increase in meds: Valdoxan, Lexapro and Lamotrogine. Not long after these were commenced, I chanced a piece of lamb when my fiancé was cooking a roast. I LOVE roast. No pain...\\n\\nContinued to trial small amounts of red meat and chicken and hurrah, I was cured! But then I began having problems with lactose. Mainly milk. Urgent, intense cramping followed by diahorrea. So I got rid of one intolerance and ended up with another!\\n\\nUnfortunately, the combination of meds wasn't working so changed to Cymbalta and remained on Lamotrigine and have been ever since. Now I have problems with foods containing a lot of oil (even things like pesto etc.) and sometimes I don't even know why I have pain.\\n\\nHad a colonoscopy last week because my C-Reative Protein count is 37 and my gastroenterologist was suspecting Crohn's and all was okay, including biopsy results that I just got back today.\\n\\nI'm so confused and actually disheartened that they didn't find anything. It's so difficult to avoid so many different foods!\\n\\nI have to go back to my gastroenterologist (when I can afford it...) but in the mean time, I'm super lost and could do with some advice or help or... has anyone heard of anything like this before? I'm so confused...\\nAsk your gastroenterologist who did the scope if your Illeum was scoped.\\nThis is not a normal part of the regular screening colonoscopy; however it is a must when looking for Chrons...deterioration of the Illeum can cause all of the symtoms you are describing.\\n\\nNot all doctors scope the Illeum, as I stated, it is not normally done...and its a difficult area for the scope to get to- so many don't try...but find out if your was, and if it wasnt ask them, how do they know its not Crohns Disease?\",\n",

I do only have a bowel movement about once a week which I am aware is not normal. I did go to the doctor for this issue and listed all of the above symptoms to him.

I still have some bloat here and there since then but nothing to the degree that I was at originally.\\n\\nRecently I changed GP doctors because my previous one blamed everything that I went to see her for on my weight. Based on the the above information (neg Celiac) my new GP wants to me to have a colonoscopy for possible Crohn\\'s and to also have a colon cancer check (due to being over 50) PLUS I\\'m having swallowing issues so he wants the Gastro to perform an endoscopy at the same time.

I also feel like I might say something inappropriate and unkind when I\\'m \"put under\" for the procedure(s).\\nI know this all sounds silly ..but it is how I feel. Please don\\'t judge .. I\\'m just very overwhelmed with anxiety over this.\\nHi. I can understand why you would feel like you do, but having had 15 colonoscopies and endoscopies; I am here to tell you, there is nothing to it!\\n\\nFirst of all, you can find a female doctor if that makes you feel better. Call around and see who has one in your area....but honestly, even if the doctor is male; here is what you can expect.\\n\\nYou will be taken into an area where you will put on a gown, open in the back. You can wear sweatpants under it right up until they wheel you in. You will have met your anesthesiologist- and they will have started an IV in your arm.\\n\\nWhen it is time to go in, you take off the sweatpants, but you will be under blankets- lots of them. You can pull them up to your chin! Once in the room you will be told to roll over on your left side...there will be nurses by your head, your doctor will be looking down at you from the side. You will see a TV screen with nothing on it. Then, they will administer the drugs through the IV. You will remember NOTHING after that!\\n\\nI\\'ve seen colonoscopies done. The doctor doesn\\'t ever look at your butt- he or she is looking at the screen the entire time. The tube has a camera on it and this is how they know what is in there- by watching the screen. The tube itself is no bigger than a straw, and once you are asleep it will be inserted (with lots of lubricant) usually by the nurse who then hands the end of it to the doctor.  He will move it around but honestly, he isnt looking at you...just the screen. When it is time to take it out, it comes out very quickly and is immediately thrown into the sterilizer bag- and you are wheeled to recovery. Again, the blankets will be pulled up to you chin!\\n\\nJust like a gyn is embarrassing the first few times- GI doctors do this day in and day out...to them it is a way of potentially saving someone\\'s life!  They consider it a privilege to do that...they see all sizes and shapes, colors and religions- they don\\'t judge, I promise.\\n\\nGet the tests. You\\'ll be amazed how fast it is over (usually within 20 minutes for a colonoscopy and another 9 minutes for an endoscopy (Which goes down your throat, no need to be embarrassed for that at all). Within an hour you will be on your way home!\\n\\nPiece of cake and the single most important test you can have done. Colon cancer and other issues of the colon are both preventable and fixable but only if they catch them early.\\n\\nI hope this helped alittle.\\nHugs!',\n",

       " {'post': 'The colonoscopy was performed with some difficulty as originally an adult scope was used but then changed to a pedi scope due to luminal narrowing.\\n\\nFindings:\\n-The Peoria all examination was normal.\\n-Two 1mm polyps we’re found in the rectum. The polyps were sessile.  The polyps were removed with a cold biopsy forceps.  Resection and retrieval were complete. Estimated blood loss was minimal.\\n\\nThe colon diffusely had evidence of prior disease with scattered areas of loss of the normal vasculature.  There were also scattered pseudopolyps.  The transverse colon diffusely had numerous pseudo and inflammatory polyps and was mild to moderately inflamed mucosa with diffuse circumferential congested, erythematous, friable (with contact bleeding), erosions, white exudate and vascular-pattern-decreased mucosa was found in the entire transverse colon. In addition, the regular adult scope had to be changed to a pedi scope because at the start of the transverse colon the lumen was narrowed from extensive pseudopolyp formation at that area. The other areas of the colon were not inflamed. Four biopsy specimens were sent to Pathology.Estimated blood loss was minimal.\\n-The terminal ileum appeared normal\\n-Multiple small and large-mouthed diverticula we’re found in the descending and sigmoid colon.\\n\\nI originally was diagnosed with UC 1980 that affected the entire colon.  Over the years I’ve pretty much been in remission.  Since then I’ve probably had 6 to 10 flares. This is the first yearly colonoscopy I’ve had with this transverse colon issue and it’s got me concerned. Have not heard from pathology yet as the colonoscopy was just two days ago. I appreciate any input. Thank you.\\nHi. I am not exactly sure what you are asking here.\\n\\nThe report basically says that you have allot of psudopolyps; which are precursors to actual polyps. 4 were removed....this is standard as they always remove anything that shouldn\\'t be there in hopes of preventing any spreading of possible disease. The great news is now that they are gone, even if there was disease, its gone now!\\n\\nThe terminal illeum being normal is also good news; no sign of Chrons diesese or any IBD.\\n\\nEverything else is pretty much from the UC which you already know you have.\\n\\nThe fact that they changed from a full scope to a pedio scope is simply due to the inflammation and scar tissue from the UC. I have to have a pedioscope done as well- similar background.\\n\\nAt this point, all you can do is wait for the Pathology report and a call from your doctor\\'s office. Again, good news. If anything was there which was URGENT, you would have probably been called already. These things get read fairly quickly.\\n\\nHang in there...you can call your doctors office on Monday to ask if its been read yet.\\nI see nothing regarding rectum, descending, ascending inflammation....only in transverse.  I would suspect your issues are more CD related rather than UC, especially with the narrowing and abundance of pseudopolyps.\\n\\nWhat meds are you on?\\n\\nThe sessile polyps would be a concern to me considering you have IBD.\\n\\nPlease let us know the results of your biopsies pathology....I hope the doc took them throughout.\\n\\nq\\n\\nThank you for reply, I appreciate it.\\nYes, Doc took 4 biopsies every 10cm throughout the colon.\\nWhat meds are you on  at this point? And what was the transverse like at your last year c-scope?\\n\\nIt sounds like a thorough GI, .....and hopefully the biopsies will reveal if anything else is going on, and a plan if needed will be set in place.\\nPlease update us when you get the results.\\nq\\nLast years colonoscopy had the usual UC remnents.  Out of all the years of colonoscopies this is the first time they had to change to a pedi scope to get to the transverse colon.  As for meds the generic Lialda and mesalamine enemas.

Well now he is totally disabled and waiting for a lover transplant. I wrote to the Senator of our state and the congressman for help. It is so hard to get a hospital to accept you as a recipient. I wrote to many organizations and we are still testing to see if he is a candidate. Why not he has all the blood work done and his MELD # is 21. But we are still testing and still not on the list. It takes a act of congress and alot of finances to get anyone to listen. He is 45 and not ready to give up. We are praying and I will not stop learning more and more about this disease. Hepatitis C is a very dormant disease you can have it for years and never know. All you out there scared or confused do your own research it helps. We are not giving up her in Florida.\\n\\nIts a liver tranplant not Lover transplant sorry I am very anxious\\n\\nI\\'m so sorry this is happening, and it\\'s a good thing your husband has you to fight for him.\\nHi Lori\\n\\nMy husband had a serious liver disease which destroyed his liver. In July 2000, he  had a liver transplant. The new liver is still working wonderful. My prayers are with your husband and you. I know what you are going through.I  hope you\\'ll stay in touch.\\n\\nHugs Nadine\\n\\nHi Lori,\\nMy husband had something similar. He had a kidney stone and when they did the CT scan they discovered his liver was in serious trouble. After months of testing they finally decided he had an autoimmune disease that attacked his liver. At the time it sort of seemed to me that they just couldn\\'t come up with a diagnosis and so said auto immune. His MELD is 20, but he\\'s doing great right now. Do you have good insurance? Liver transplants are very expensive. DO you feel he is getting good care? If not try a different medical facility. You\\'ll have to research online to find where they do liver transplants.\\n\\nThe very best of luck. The chances are pretty good, you know. At least he didn\\'t cause his liver to fail. From what I have seen the medical profession don\\'t look too kindly on those whose livers fail due to heavy drinking or drug misuse. Hep C does not fall into that category.\\n\\nHang in there. There should be light at the end of the tunnel. Mind him and mind yourself.\\n\\nBeanAosta\\ni know they have to do things in very srict ways just because of the huge supply and demand of any given organs,but i would think they could place him but just at alower status just so he could accrue time? my son had a liver Tx back in 2000,but he was not actually placed on that list til things really hit the fan. this was despite him actually presenting with this \"suprise\" liver failure thing being IN portal hypertension and vomiting up blood at the time,and also only down to having about 20% liver function left. once they were able to do the TIPS procedure,they said he could go for years before having to go that route,BUT unfortunetly only a few months later he developed a horrid case of pancreatitis and his condtion changed as well as his original Dx. he was not \\'officially\\' placed on that list til things were really really going down hill just from oct 99 to may 19th when we had to rush him to the ER of the university hospital where he was going to hopefully obtain the eventual tx. once all that occured THEN the tx commitee felt he NEEDED placement. its all pretty screwed upthere ya know?\\n\\ni don;t believe they used the same scoring methods back then that they do now,such as the meld score? in order for anyone to actually be placed on that list,the transplant committee at any given hospital has to arrive at certain conclusions about how really bad the patient is doing,and chances of survival with Tx vs stability in conditon and other things too numerous to even mention. you CAN try other hospitals who do tx too. possibly getting placed on their Tx list? it all goes into the general \\'list\\' but being on any given hospitals list makes them just aware and looking for \\'you\\' for that organ,you know what i mean? it all kind of comes down to what his docs really feel and the tx committees at the hospitals who meet weekly to decide those particular decisions. i know when my son was finally placed,we were told(and this just gave me the shivers) that \\'depending upon the ins co decision,we will be placing him on the list\" scared the crap outta me since i didn\\'t know at that time just what in gods name was actually going to be covered by our ins co. thankfully it was not an issue when it was needed.\\n\\nthe thing here is,if your hubby is considered to be \\'stabilized\" it could take a bit longer to get him placed vs someone who is not actually stable? it just comes down to what the actual \\'needs\\' are of the patient and if they even can wait,you know? any other medical complications would also factor in even if the scoring would dictate otherwise too. like i mentioned before,alot of different factors go into that placement decision,unfortunetly.\\n\\nso,you were not even aware that your hubby was even sick til the ammonia level caused that coma to occur? has he reached portal hypertension yet or had the TIPS done to try and help that if he has? this is what made the difference with our son. when we were literally \"whisked\\' out of the childrens hospital we were in in their ER that day after he vomited up blood at school(to the university of MN),they were actually talking an immediate tx. we went from,that morning to sending what i thought was a completely totally healthy child off to school in the morning to possibly looking at a liver Tx that night. what a freaky day,let me tell ya. it was an \\'immediate\\' type of situation til they decided to actually try,for the very first time at any hospital other than one in califorina to attempt a pediatric TIPs on him. once that was accomplished and he was doing much better,any mention of the list or even the transplant was kind of placed on the back burner type thing? the placement,like i said,did not actually take place til his condition just really started to totally deteriorate and he was actually dying a bit each day. THEN things got really ugly.\\n\\nwhat exactly IS your hubbys overall medical status right now? have they had any good success at getting that ammonia down to a much safer type level?what is it at right now? the overall \\'stability\" of his condition will ultimately play the biggest factor in any list placement. sorry for you having to deal with all this. but you sound like you are doing everything you can here and THAT is something. if they realistically have not yet even finished doing the huge workup and testing that needs to be done,that too could be holding things up with any placement at this earlier stage too ya know? they just wont know his total full status medically at this stage yet. if the patient is considered to be \"stable\\' overall,they need to wait til ALL the results come in so it can even be brought up with the transplant committee and even discussed as well. they just really need ALL the hard facts and results before that placement can even be considered,thats all. as long as he is stable and they can treat the ongoing symptoms with good results,that placement may just be a bit further off too. i do know originally,like i mentioned at the beginning here,when we first started with this whole nightmare,his GI doc did mention getting him placed just to accrue time on that list,then for some reason(but he also was much much more stable after the TIPS was done),it never got really brought up again til much later when things were just horrid for him. i am wondering if they even go that route anymore when considering just how many people really need the organs,ya know? believe me, i do know what you are going thru here and you DO have my total and complete empathy there. hopefully his condition will not deteriorate rapidly and he still can have some good quality of life once they can get everything more stable and settled down for him. like you mentioned in your post,when dealing with hep C,alot of things can change with this condition,it is not something that just follows a very direct course like other conditions,so that may also be playing a part in the wait for the placement.\\n\\ni really do hope he stabilizes and wont need any transplant for quite some time yet. under the right conditions when living with hep C,it can actually be a pretty long time before he would even realistically actually NEED that tx. it comes down to alot of underlying factors and complications and his true \\'need\\' at that point. i amjust hoping for the best for the both of you. good luck and please keep us posted. **',\n",

I started taking Gaviscon to relieve the pain, and after a short while the pain eased.\\n\\nI went to see my GP who felt my upper stomach (which was sore) and he said I had acid refluc and prescribed ant acids to stop the acid forming.  However, last week I was in such agony I had to call an ambulance in the middle of the night as the pain would not subside.\\n\\nI was taken to hospital and the doctor took some blood tests.  They came back showing I was slightly anaemic, but more worryingly, my liver enzymes were slightly raised. She told me to see my GP for repeat tests.  She did send me for an X-ray to see if I had any perforation to my stomach which showed I did not.  She sent me home with strong painkillers and antacids.\\n\\nI then returned to hospital for repeat blood tests and have now been told by my GP that there is slight anaemia, slight kidney malfunction (I am late 40\\'s) but more seriously I have 3 very raised liver enzymes. They are the AST, ALP and GGT.\\n\\nI have to see my GP on Monday who has refereed me for a Laprascpropy (sp?), more blood tests, and a liver scan.\\n\\nAs you can imagine, I am out of my mind with worry and thinking all sorts!!\\n\\nLast year I had a kind of MOT blood test and that was all clear, so this has come as an awful shock.  I have not lost weight, and am not jaundiced although I do occasionally feel tired and listless with little energy.\\n\\nWould anyone know what these liver enzyme readings could suggest? I am a real panicker and always fear the worst, but I obviously have to face up to whatever is going on.\\n\\nYour thoughts, ideas or information on this would be really, really, appreciated.\\n\\nMany thanks in advance!!!!\\n\\nStrawberry\\ni am just wondering why you are actually being sent for a lap when a simple ultrasound could give you ALOT of solid info and would not be the least bit invasive for you or carry the risks? i have a kidney liver disease and all i have ever had to have for my docs to gain all the ifo they have needed to actually monitor my condition is labs and the yearly USs. i would seriously discuss the actual need for a lap vs the simple ultrasound which can also take a good look at real bloodflow thru the organs with the doppler tool they have(a lap is just an exploration which does have some issues that come along for the ride with doing it). this just sounds like a bit much for what your real needs are right now,thats all. there are a few different types of liver/kidney diseases out there that you could possibly have evenhad since birth that just had not yet showed themselves in any way yet becasue the labs would not have changed til the real damage hits a certain level. i found out about my particular liver/kidney issues when i was actually 40 years old after our then 12 year old son became extremely ill and we were told that he got it from one of us,his parents. while my actual lab numbers are all amazingly within the norm ranges, my kidneys and liver show a totally different story upon simple ultrasound. alot of cystic development going on but still have great labs. crazy but true.\\n\\ni would seriously speak with whoever ordered the lap and ask if you can at least start this process with a simple ultrasound first,before anything else more invasive gets done. its just not actually needed right now,honestly.\\n\\nthere could possibly be many different reasons for the changes in your numbers. its kind of hard to say based on this particular type of forum. but one big thing i found out when my son went into liver failure is that jaundice is NOT always the first indicator of liver problems. my son was actually down to having only about 20% of his actual liver function left when we found out that he was even sick. but no jaundice actually set in til a few months later. really suprised me since i had always assumed whenever there was something affecting your liver,that jaundice was kind of an automatic thing you saw first? not so,believe me.\\n\\npersonally,and based upon my experience,i do thing just obtaining that non invasive US and just the bloodwork for right now would really be the best next steps for you. the US really does get a very very accurate look along with the real bloodflow than other types of testing for what you need right now. once you have obtained that US,it would dictate any further types of testing that may be needed, but i just think your GP is kind of doing a bit of overkill for what you actually need to know right now,ya know? you can just find out alot of solid info with just doing that US than you could with a lap without any risks to you at all. its a simple first line type of testing.\\n\\njust by the way,they DO have a really great liver board here if you just take a scroll on down a bit further from here. i do wish you lots of luck with this and hope this isn\\'t a disease process for you to have to deal with. you just really never know what is actually going on inside anyones body til you take that good look inside. in your case,an US would suffice for now,really. please keep me posted on what you find out. **\\nfeel bad ... sounds like you have polycystic kidney disease ... as an FYI(hope if you\\'re high risk, (+) family history of a brain hemorrhage, headaches/neurologic symptoms, or have job that would be incredibly dangerous to yourself/others if you passed out like a bus driver, that you get aneurysm screening ...\\n\\nanyways back to strawberryx7 ... couple of things ... about your liver function tests ... 1) AST is a very specific for damage to liver cells(it\\'s an enzyme released when cells are damaged/inflamed), so it being elevated is suggestive of some liver \"damage\"/inflammation, but if you drink any alcohol, this could be one factor which caused this to be elevated ... 2) the alkaline phosphatase(you referred to ALP) and the GGT(gamma glutamyl transferase) go hand in hand, if you have liver problems, more characteristically blockage of the bile ducts in/around the liver, the alkaline phosphatase can be elevated and a lot of people will either fractionate the ALP(to directly determine the source of the ALP, as it can come from liver, bone, pancreas etc etc) or order a GGT or 5\\'-nucleotidase, which are other enzymes suggestive of liver damage .. so the picture of an elevated alkaline phosphatase and GGT suggest some sort of liver pathology\\n\\nto really be able to intepret you liver function test, it is important to know the actually values including you ALT/AST/alkP/total bilirubin/direct(unconjugated) bilirubin, but also you albumin/total protein/PT/PTT/INR(which relative measures of your livers synthetic function)  .. I would also be interested to see what your amylase and lipase were when you were in the emergency room\\n\\njust to echo what feelbad sad, how is it that you haven\\'t had a RUQ(right upper quadrant) ultrasound, even if you went to the EW, most would check this to make sure that you don\\'t have gallstones .. the symptoms you are describing could very well be biliary colic(crampy pain usually associated with meals, especially fatty meals, that represents the gallbladder contracting against biliary ducts blocked by a stone(s)), could be bile reflux, which unlike GERD/reflux which involves high acid in the stomach will not respond to the H2 blockers(Zantac/tagamet) and proton pump inhibitors(prilosec), the other thing, especially with your age and labs, would be primary biliary cirrhosis(which is an autoimmune phenomenon seen in middle aged women, it\\'s genetic, involves destruction of bile ducts and can be asymptomatic initially and first diagnosed by labs, but also presents with fatigue/itching/abd pain ... heck there are other causes which could account for this, but these are some of the basics\\n\\nin regards to your other abnormalities ... slight anemia/renal dysfunction, let\\'s take it one at a time ...\\n\\nwhat are your blood counts, aka your hemoglobin/hematocrit/MCV(size of red blood cells)/MCH(tells us about the amount of color in your red blood cells)/RDW(tells me and you about the variation in size of your red blood cells/reticulocyte count(tells me about the number of young red bloods cells your body\\'s producing to make up for the low counts), you\\'re youngish to have had a colonoscopy, but did anyone ever do a rectal exam to see if you had blood \"hidden\" in your stool, or even better have you ever noticed frank blood in your stool or black stool ... assuming your still having periods, you could very well be iron-deficient, but it sounds like your anemia needs to be worked up a little better\\n\\nin terms of you kidney dysfunction ... what was your BUN/Cr .. based on your age/race/gender/Cr did anyone ever mention what your GFR was .. your renal failure/kidney disease sounds like it could be from many different things ... are you dehydrated, take a lot of NSAIDs(ibuprofen/aleve), take any prescription meds ...\\n\\nit does seem like a explor lap would be aggressive, especially because the w/u for your lab abnormalities hasn\\'t been fully completed, but I assume your GP has her/his reasons\\n\\nbest of luck\\nHi ** & Hermes,\\n\\nThank you so much for your very informed and detailed replies.\\n\\nHermes,  I do not know the actual counts of my ast/alp/ggt results, but I shall ring my GP tomorrow and ask him if he can tell me and then I will post them up.\\n\\nMy anaemia is not bad (seem to remember my GP mention 11.something? - just slightly down) but I do suffer from heavy periods.\\n\\nI don\\'t quite understand why my kidney is showing signs of malfunction as I don\\'t have any symptoms.\\n\\nBut I am extremely worried about my liver results, and all terrible thoughts are racing through my head.\\n\\nDo you think there could be a connection between these dreadful upper stomach pains I have been suffering intermittently and my liver?

However, I am wondering if this is just coincidence and the two problems are unrelated?\\n\\nGallstones is something that did cross my mind, but the doctor in the emergency department of the hospital seemed to rule them out as she said I wasn\\'t jaundiced (but as ** says you don\\'t necessarily need to be jaundiced).\\n\\nUnfortunately, here in the UK the health service can be a bit hit and miss, and depending on which hospital you go to the treatment can vary enormously.\\n\\nI am booked to have more blood tests as you know, and an ultra sound scan of my liver. I am absolutely dreading the lap - not just beacuse of what they may find - but the actual procedure. I wonder if I ask them if they could just do the ultra sound first and see if they can discover what\\'s wrong by that?\\n\\nHermes, you say my ALP and GGT readings could be suggestive of some sort of blockage: could that be a tumour or a gallstone? What is the most usual blockage?  Also, would a blockage cause symptoms 24/7 or could pain come on intermittenly?\\n\\nI will try to find out what my Amylase and Lipase readings were at the hospital for you - hopefully they will be able to give them to me.\\n\\nI am so worried about all this, and being a panicky type of person doesn\\'t help either. I keep bursting into tears and thinking the worst, but I know I have to face up to whatever is going on.\\n\\nThank you so much for your detailed replies - I cannot tell you how much I appreciate your advice.\\n\\nBest wishes,\\n\\nStrawberry\\nHi - me again.\\n\\nSorry, I think in my panic I may have mixed up laparoscopy with endoscopy.  My GP said to me today I would need to have one, but after putting the phone down I was so worried I might have confused the two.\\n\\nI will phone my GP tomorrow to confirm which procedure it is and let you know.\\n\\nKind regards,\\n\\nStrawberry\\ngallstones tend to cause intermittent pain unless one get trapped in a duct(whether it be the cystic duct which connects the gallbladder to the common bile duct or the a stone stuck in the common bile duct -- the so called choledocholithiasis) and cannot move ... otherwise gallstone pain usually is intermittent because stones are only temporarily obstructive(like a kidney stone) and it\\'s greatest when your eating or really after, when the bile system is contracting ...\\n\\ndefinitely don\\'t need to be jaundiced by exam for gallstones, as you bilirubin levels may not be high enough to color your mucous membranes, sclera, or skin ... from what I remember you must have Tbili\\'s greater than 1.5 to really start to see the yellowness ...\\n\\nalso know, that even though gallbladder pain tends to be in the right upper quadrant of the belly, gallbladder pain does not have to be typical .. it wouldn\\'t be out of the question to see epigastric(over/around the stomach) pain actually be gallbladder pain ...\\n\\nin terms of blackages ... biliary blockages are almost always from gallstones(cholelithiasis) ... yes there are tumors/infiltrative disease/infections/etc that can cause this but don\\'t get worked up until the data comes back ...\\n\\nbest of luck\\nHi Hermes,\\n\\nThank you so much for your reply!  You\\'ve really helped me to try and stay rational and not get too worked up before the results of my tests.\\n\\nI\\'m hoping it is just Gallstones (who would think anyone would wish they had Gallstones?!\\n) but I do fear the worst, and try as I might I still feel a bag of nerves.\\n\\nI\\'ll try to find out today from the hospital what my amylase and lipase counts were when I went to emergency (although whether or not they\\'ll give them to me I\\'m not sure - they may tell me to see my GP instead - but I\\'ll try). Would my GP have those readings in the latest blood test too do you think? And would both readings give you more information to the possible cause?\\n\\nI\\'ve a feeling my enzymes are more raised in the second blood test than they were in the first blood test when I went to emergency. What could that mean?\\n\\nI remember the doctor in emergency telling me my liver enzymes were slightly raised (but maybe she didn\\'t want to alarm me as I was in so much pain), but my GP told me on the phone yesterday that my enzymes were either very raised, or high (can\\'t remember which as I sort of went numb).  I was also alarmed that the hospital returned my blood test results so quickly (the next day) - they usually take a week to come through - so I would guess they are fairly raised.\\n\\nIf they are rising what could that suggest?\\n\\nSorry to bombard you with so many questions, but you are so helpful and I\\'m working myself up into a panic again.\\n\\nBest wishes\\n\\nStreawberry\\nwow hermes,you really DO know your liver stuff. yep, i do have PKD with liver involvement and we went thru the aneurysm stuff in 05. came as a huge suprise to me. luckily i used to have a very highly experienced and knowledgable neurosurgeon who has since retired on me,who sent me for the MRA despite the fact my aneurysm,just becasue it was in a bend in an artery did not actually fully show itself on my MRI. he was an amazing man who removed another vascular malformation from within my spinal cord in 03. its that naturally weaker vessel crap that caused this malformation too. except i was actually born with this glob inside my cord,just didn;t have a clue til i had an MRI done on my c spine for a herniated disc and it just \"glowed\" inside my cord up there.\\n\\nstrawberry, all the info H gave you is right on the money. the endo makes ALOT more sense than a lap,really. they are looking for signs of possible varices within your throat and stomach with that test. my son had this once he reached the  portal hypertension stage. its a back up of blood from the liver when the portal vein gets closed off from scar tissue. considering your low hemo,this just could be one reason for it. the veins within that area just become a bit more pressurized and can break and bleed into the stomach. this was where my son was at when he first presented with this stuff. have you happened to notice any \\'darkened/blackish\" type of stools lately? or something that looks like coffee grounds?\\n\\nyour amy and lipase are actually pancreatic enzymes/labs used to check their functions. my son ended up with pancreatitis with his liver issues. this gave him some pretty severe pain in the lower LQ. one thing about your mid upper pain, my son used ice packs all the time on this area,he said it just made things feel better. just a thought for you.\\n\\nyou really do need to have the further testing just to see what is actually the cause of your ongoing symptoms and raises in your lab numbers. there has to be an underlying reason/condition that you have going on to affect both the liver and the kidneys. the disease i have could be one of the causes. just so you know,with GB issues,it is also possible(only becasue of how a particular nerve runs) to actually have left sided chest pain,and also with liver issues too. my son had shoulder pain on that L side with his liver problems,and i know other people who have actually experienced this too. just an FYI incase it should occur with you.\\n\\ni don;t know for certain just how medical record acess is over there but you should be able to legally obtain ANY part of your own medical records without problems. i do think that much would just be a given in anywhere you live. i know it is in the US. i have all madical records from my ongoing medical issues and my sons too. one huge thing you really need to start doing is obtaining every single copy of any ongoing labs. doing this one thing got my son the attention he desperately needed one night when i had to call his GI doc and i started rattling off the big changes in his lab numbers from three seperate ER visits all done within that last three weeks. espescially in any hospital,they can just make a copy right there for you before you even leave the place. its all in their computer system,all you have to do is just ask. this is what i kept doing. obtaining all medical records in an ongoing way and keeping them all in some type of expandable folder really helps tons in just having all of your impotant info when you see other docs or even have to go back to the ER. it saves a ton of time and gives the docs a \"baseline\" of info to work from. just take that folder to every doc appt and er visit. believe me, you will be glad you did at some point. it helps that much trust me.\\n\\nthe reasons for you raising numbers could be many,but what those numbers actually indicate for the most part is overall organ function. so the higher they go,the less function you actually have. don;t mean to freak you out here just really want you to know as much as possible. just start obtaining ALL records and most importantly all lab and testing results from here on out and get what hads already been generated. this does help,alot. and also allows you to keep on top of all things too.\\n\\nyour GP \"may\\' have the labs but if not,he certainly could get them for you. all most docs have to do is call a particular number from their office(to that particular hosp) in most cases,and they can get all of your labs directly from the hospital lab, it isn;t that hard.\\n\\nwith more direct testing,they should be able to give you better more solid info as to just what it is you are dealing with here and possible treatment options too. with one ultrasound,they could tell for certain if this is what i have with the PKD or not. the cystic development is very distinct with PKD in just how the cysts themselves actually look. but as H and myself stated,this could be from a bunch of different possibilities.PKD is just one of a few different types of liver/kidney diseases. or stones can really throw your numbers too since they can actually block areas completely which would affect the functions of other organs too. right now unfortunetly,you are in the test and wait mode. this IS just part ofthe process unfortunetly. been here way too many times to count actually.\\n\\nso just when are these tests actually scheduled for? i do hope this is something more minor that can be easily fixable or treated. you will just have to wait and see how things go. i wish you nothing but good luck with this. please keep us posted on anything you find out hon,K? **\\nHi Feelbad,\\n\\nThank you for your detailed reply and kind words.\\n\\nI just thought I\\'d give you an update on what happened.\\n\\nAfter speaking to my GP\\'s surgery again I was told to go and see him the next day.  When I saw him he seemed very irate (we\\'ve known each other for 20 years and are almost like friends) and he was all in a state about my raised liver enzymes. Of course, this made me more nervous than ever.\\n\\nApparently, my liver enzymes back in December were totally normal.  One of them (can\\'t remember which) was 32 - which was perfectly normal -  and then the recent test showed it to be 676!!!\\nMy other enzymes were all totally off the radar too and he said something must have happened within the last 6 months to make them soar to such high levels.\\n\\nHe then told me he\\'d booked me in for a liver scan the next day\\nand told me to phone him after I\\'d had it done.\\n\\nI went the next day for the scan and was soooo worried what they would find. But the doctor was very nice and put me totally at ease. He did the scan and immediately saw that I had 3 gallstones! Phew.....relief!\\n\\nThey are very small and he said that when I had the severe attack of pain I probably passed one which was blocking the bile duct; hence my raised liver enzymes.\\n\\nLuckily I do not need surgery to remove them (they can be treated with a medicine to dissolve them) and he told me that my liver looked normal; was not inflamed, and that gallstones are very common.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve had these gallstones for some time because I have in the past had interment pains where I have felt like I could shoot myself! Touch wood I haven\\'t had any repeat episodes of these attacks, and once they are dissolved, hopefully that will be the end of it.\\n\\nAnyway,  I would like to thank both you and Hermes for being so helpful and informative, and I shall keep you updated.\\n\\nBest wishes\\n\\nStrawberry\\nthanks for letting us know hon. i am relieved for ya too. those stones can really make certain numbers go crazy just from blockage of the normal flow in there. at least you have a reason/explanation for your symptoms and that in and of itself is a biggie. alot of people spend years trying to find the true source of certain problems and pain. hope things continue to go well for ya. **',\n",

       " {'post': \"I have posted on parathryoid threads before. I have hyperpt and am monitoring my calcium and pth levels for that for now.\\nI went to my endo dr and asked to do tests for thyroid. I always have had thin, fine hair but seems to be getting thinner. I was on a beta blocker for elevated bp and heart rate for 7 months but am off it now-doing okay so far. I had lost some weight earlier this year. I thought due to anxiety/stress worrying about myself and also my brother passed away. Last year, I had gained some weight and seemed tired, etc. Last Dec. I had ultrasound on thryoid-slightly enlarged and no nodules. I have been seeing an endo surgeon and endo dr for parathyroids. This last time I asked end dr to do tests for thyroid. I checked my labs online this morning. I hope dr will be calling me. It looks like anti levels are high. Does that mean antibodies are attacking my thyroid. Hashimotos? Thyroiditis? I have read before on thyroid and meds and really get confused. Any help will be appreciated. The numbers in parenthesis are ref ranges for the lab. I think I had the FT3 done so maybe that one hasn't come in yet.\\nThanks so much, Pam\\n\\nCalcium blood-10.2 (8.5-10.2)\\nVit D-25 OH 29 (30-80)\\nIntact PTH 56 (10-65)\\nThyroid\\nTSH 3.15 (0.300-5.00)\\nFT4 0.83 (0.50-1.20)\\nTriiodothyronine, Total 118 (80-200)\\nAnti-thyroglobulin 250.0  (0.0-0.40)\\nAnit-thyroid Peroxab 172.0 (0.40)\\nI got a letter from endo dr today. It says my calcium, Vit D, and parathryoid levels are all in the normal range.  My serum thyroid titers were positive. These results are taken to indicate that you have autoimmune disease thyroid disease. This is a condition in which  the body has developed antibodies in an immune response against part of it itself, namely proteins with the tissues that constitute your thyroid gland. Please call for an appt to return to my office in 6 mos.\\n\\nOkay, someone please help me on the thyroid. Don't I need to be getting this treated with thryoid meds? Do my numbers on antibodies have to be higher or what? Should I get a second opinion from another endo dr or find a good internal med dr or a good gp? I know I can email or call this endo to ask. I am hoping to get some advice from someone here. Thanks so much!\\nI\\n\\nCalcium blood-10.2 (8.5-10.2)\\n\\nThis shows you are deficient in vitamin D and need to get out in the sun a bit more.. 15 minutes bursts as well as add a vit D, vit K and Calcium supplement.  I was 22 on your scale.  I was told to eat to of the Viactive vitachews a day.  Call and ask your MD/nurse what the best supplement is for you.\\n\\nThis is normal and shows that you do not have a parathyroid issues.\\n\\nThis is the newest range as of 2006.  The lab is behind the times.  You are hypothyroid and given your antibody levels should be placed at least on 50 mcgs of synthroid.  This is my opinion because I believe in optimal levels and proactive treatment of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\\n\\nYou are at 47% here.  This is suboptimal.. but not far outside of the 50-80% optimal window.  This result should be fairly accurate FT4 tests have a 2.5-5% source of error in the results.\\n\\n\\nThis is a Total T3 it is an approximate measure of your T3 levels and there is a 20% error inherent in this test.  So you are at 31% here.  OPtimal is 50-80 % of the normal range as well. Oftimes T3 is artificially inflated in women.  If you are on birth control pills/hormone supplements you need a FT3 for sure.\\n\\nSo looking at your levels 47% (+/-5%) and 31% (+/-20%) I think you would benefit from a bit of thyroid medication.  That low T3 is really making you feel bad.  I think you should also push for an FT3.  So that you know where you are in relation to your FT4 more accurately.  This is my opinion and the Endo may snort and ignore it.\\n\\nThese mean you have a nice active case of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.  Why didn't your Endo recommend 25 - 50 mcg trial of synthroid?  I would call and ask if they would be willing to let you try a supplement given your symptoms.\\n\\nMG\\nMG, I am more confused now. By reading, I thought when I heard from endo dr that I would be prescribed some medication. I received a letter from her a couple of hours after I made my first post. In it, it says, My calcium, Vit D, and parathryoid levels are all in the normal range. My serum thyroid titers were positive. These results are taken to indicate that I have an autoimmune thyroid disease. This is a condition in which  the body has developed antibodies in an immune response against part of it itself, namely proteins with the tissues that constitute your thyroid gland. Please call for an appt to return to my office in 6 mos.\\n\\nOkay, I already have an appt in FE when I saw her to check levels for the parathryoid. I had asked about having thryoid tests done. Now what I have read online about antibodies, etc. that I need to be on some med. Why wait 6 mos? This isn't going to get better on it's own, is it? Probably get worse? I am more confused and scared. I will have to contact her and ask. Or see another dr.\\n\\nThank you for your reply.\\nPam\\n\\nMy calcium and pth levels were high last Dec/Jan. Calcium was 12.2 and 11. PTH was 150. I was sent to general surgeon by my pcp. I almost had parathyroid surgery. I was on a beta blocker for high bp and heart rate so was feeling sick from that. I went to an endo surgeon after that in March. My levels have dropped to normal. I guess they can flucuate. Now I am off the beta blocker and doing okay so far. That's why I have to go back to endo dr to check calcium and parathryoid levels in 6 mos. I am in TN outside of Nashville. I posted in January on finding a dr and you replied to me on that thread.\\nHashimoto's thyroiditis is the autoimmune hypothyroid disorder.  It will not get better.  It is the condition where your immune system has been trigger and believes that the thyroid is a foriegn agent producing bad stuff.  Every time your thyroglobin and TPOs are activated.. it is warfare.  Your body is on a mission to obliterate all thyroid tissue.  It can take months.. it can take years.  It all depends on your body and thyroid health.\\n\\nYou need an new MD in my opinion.  What is the name of the MD that you saw?  How old are you?  I have only seen Dr. Lakhani at Vanderbilt once.  He is a TSH hugger, but also believes that the Ft4 levels should be in the upper range of normal. In addition if you are a female of childbearing age he believes in proactive medication of hashimoto's thyroiditis.  So you can see if you can get in to see him.  Also you can look up my MD in Chattanooga if you like.  Dr. Natalie Johnson.  She is an IM, but has done well by me.\\n\\nHashimoto's is not something to be scared of.. it happens.  You now know what is making you feel like Cow Flop.  Now you need treatment.  This means you need to find an MD that is up on the latest TSH ranges AND willing to proactively treat Hashimoto's.  Calling your current MD and leaving a message would be my step one.  Ask if you can start trial medication given you have hashimoto's thyroiditis.  After you here back from her.. then you will be at the Step Two.. should I cut and run and shop for a new MD.. OR should I stick it out and see how it goes.\\n\\nI wish you the best of luck.\\nMG\\nThanks MG! I contacted my endo with my concerns through the website where I can check my labs, etc. Her reply was-<the calcium and parathyroid levels are OK both very normal given your age range. Antibodies to the thyroid are actually fairly common, about 40% of women have them and only sometimes cause problems. I would be much more concerned if they were in the 1,000s. Why don't you return in three months instead?>\\n\\nI guess I will change my appt to 3 mos. The dr I see is at Vanderbilt. I see she is in the same office as Dr Lakhani. My endo surgeon is there, too. It is frustrating for me as I am trying to keep on top of the parathyroid issue. I can not take calcium supplements but can consume 1,000 mg of calcium through food, dairy, etc. Also trying to keep bp down without having to go back on a bp med. Now this thyroid issue.  I am 54 years old.\\nI understand what you are saying. I can't say I understand all the lab numbers, etc.\\nI will keep in mind about finding another dr if I don't get any help soon. Thanks so much for taking the time to reply to me.  Pam\",\n",

       " {'post': 'My 20 year old son went in for a routine tonsillectomy on 6-18.  He was given strong liquid codeine for the pain. 3 days went by and I called the office questioning his degree of pain and was told this was normal. 3 days later I called the office in the morning because he was in such severe pain.  The medical assistant called back and and said the doctor could prescribe a steroid or percocet. I chose percocet.  The office did not ask to see him.  Later that same day at 4:50 he started feeling blood in his mouth. At 4:53 I called the office, and the exchange picked up.  The doctor on call called me back.  His first question was, \"\"when did this start?\"  I said at 4:50. He said, if you would have called before 5 you would have reached your OWN surgeon.  I said that I did but the exchange was already answering.  He said, no food tonight, only popsicles and ice chips, the wound is trying to scab.  By 6:45 after 7 or 8 popsicles, which was masking the blood, I called the doctor back and left another exchange message, and my son ran in the bathroom, and projectile vomited 2 to 3 cups of blood in the bathroom.  The doctor called back after I called the exchange twice, and said go to the hospital NOW.  By the time we arrived 5 to 7 minutes later, My son\\'s stomach was full of blood, and vomited more cups of blood in the ER, and the operating room.  He was in surgery within 10 minutes of arriving at the ER to have his previous tonisillectomy site re cauterized.  He had his first surgery with a hemoglobin of 16, and left the hospital after the 2nd surgery 6 days later with an 11 hemoglobin.  I wish the doctor would have seen him when I called in for the severe pain.  Obviously there was a problem, and I feel like I was treated terribly, and ignored.  Does anyone know how long it takes a healthy strong 20 year old male to increase his blood count? does anyone feel this was malpractice by ignoring our phone calls for help?\\nNow that he\\'s been treated, he\\'ll probably be fine.  It might be several weeks before his iron count comes back up all the way, but the worst effects of blood loss pass very quickly, especially with transfusions.\\n\\nWere they neglectful?  That\\'s another question entirely.  I don\\'t know.\\n\\ngrkg1970, almost all surgical patients receive narcotics afterward.\\n\\nyou are correct.  I should have by passed his medical assistant and went directly in to the office and insisted on being seen.  He is now on his 4th night since his second surgery and feels much better than the first surgery which was 5 days prior to the second surgery.  I believe he was in pain because the clot was trying to burst, which it did.  Not sure if an office visit would have prevented this happening.  He was given no blood transfusion and getting his rosey color back.\\nanother post is probably correct that I am the one who should have just taken him to the doctor to prove the pain in person.  I have no proof the initial surgery was done incorrectly.  What happened with the bleeding was the clot that was forming at the site ruptured, but I think it was boiling to burst almost from the first day, but proving that is a different story. thank you for the support.\\nThis is in NO way YOUR fault hon you are NOT a doctor for gods sake,just a mom trying to take care of your son after a surgery. how in gods name were you just supposed to know this kind of thing was even POSSIBLE to have happen. i would not have seen this coming eirther and i have had to have six surgeries and a son who went thur a liver transplant. its just one of those post op complications that can occur after any surgery is done. you just wont know how any post op healing process will go til you get there,so this was not something YOU could or even should have seen or prevented. it was just a complication. this is just not the norm,thats all. they could have not cauterized enough or pressure could have built up in that vessel,who knows?\\n\\ni do think the other poster missed the fact that this IS a 20 year old? and jane is right,every patient,who you don;t want to see actually suffer,will in most cases,recieve some kind of narcotric,even children too. a child can suffer as much as an adult with the same surgery.\\n\\nyou did what you could do mom. calling the surgeons office is the right thing in most cases and let them dictate what needs to be done,but who could have expected this? i think they just didn;t quite \"get\\' the severity of the situation right away since this IS a very rare type of occurance with this surgery. in the future,just so you know,anytime you or anyone you know has a surgery and the surgeons office needs to be called and they are not \\'getting it\\',just head for an ER where you can at least be evaluated properly. they will take care of contacting the suregon after that,believe me.\\n\\ni would just keep getting fluids into him and if possible try and iron suppliment for a week or so just to help build that back up again(you may have to break it up if he cannot swallow it whole). he may get a bit more constipated(the narcotic and the iron will just cause this) for a while but his iron will replenish much faster.\\n\\nyou just could not have seen THAT coming so it is not at all your fault,K? i do know what its like to watch your child vomit up blood tho,just nasty. my son did this when he reached portal hypertension with the liver failure he was in. pretty ugly. so sorry you both had to go thru all this. rest and fluids are about the best thing you can do for him right now. if anything at all pops up,i am sure the surgeons office WILL be a bit more attentive. just remember when having any sirgery,if you are not getting the attention you think you should,head for the local ER,preferably the one where that surgery was done,since they would have all the surgical info there. you DO have an option here.\\n\\njust so ya know,i have never heard of any surgeon who wants to see a patient within even the first week after any surgery unless there is a very specific reason for it let alone the 48 hour thing. it is not routine to do with most surgeries. it was not up to you to even consider that one either,K? the first post op visit is at the earliest,the one week or two week post op check. it kind of depends upon the surgery. but average is six weeks for the majority.\\n\\ni do think what happened to your son was really a very rare occurance or they would have responded very differently at the surgeons office when you called,you know what i mean? you did what you were supposed to do in caring for your son,K? at least they fixed him up and things sound okay now? i do hope things get better from here. please let us know.  **\\nthank u so much for your support. Today is the same day out from the 1st surgery, so we will watch him closely.  He is eating something every 4 hours to coat his stomach for the liquid codeine.  He loves cream of wheat, of course everything is only slightly warm, but cream of wheat is high in iron so this helps his blood count.  His roommate in the hospital actually told us about this, as I had never really had to shop for high iron foods before, ha!\\nEach day will get better, thanks everyone.  Someday I may write a book about all of the hurdles he has crossed in his life to become a major league baseball player.  Although being drafted by a major league team this June, he may go ahead to his Junior year of College and see what the draft might bring next year.  We initially had this surgery because last season he was haunted with serveral bouts of tonsillitis and we didn\\'t want him to be away at College and sick this winter during the season again.  Again, thanks for listening.\\na little discouraging. Blood test, hgb, 10.6.  Was 11.4 day after surgery. So, 18 days post op, blood count went down instead of up!  We have been recommended a different type of iron supplement, so if anyone has any other suggestions...I am open to whatever you have!\\nthanks to all!\\nboy,it sure is taking a long time for that iron to come back up,are his other labs all okay? just one suggestion that really worked for my hubby? he has been donating blood for many many years(just got his 16 gallon pin a couple months ago)but for some reason,the last two times he went in,they checked his hemo and it was low for two straight times and they wont let people donate with that level. he tried various things but the only thing that really seemed to work at all was eating raisins? he took a couple of those small boxes to work everyday and just ate them during the day or with his lunch and for some reason THAT actually worked for him. don\\'t have a clue as to why his iron was so low the two other times but she told him(the nurse) that this time it was very high but still within the normal range. so i do think the raisins actually worked for him. just one suggestion that i KNOW really helped my hubby.\\n\\nyour sons iron,given his age and all,really should not be that low ya know? there could just possibly be another underlying reason that needs finding out. were all his other labs okay,or did they just check the hemo? what about clotting times and other blood related labs,all okay? if they were,things are probably okay,but this is just something you kind of need to be aware of. the tendency he has for some reason for low iron right now and possibly inthe future? right now,you just don\\'t really know. but it needs to be monitored thru out this next year espescially.\\n\\ntry the raisin thing,espescially right before(like a week before) his next blood draw and see how things go. like i mentioned above,this really was the only thing that worked for my hubbys iron deficiency. please keep me posted LM, **\\nthank you,\\nI\\'ll pick up the raisins today, and let you know about his next blood tests.\\nThe only test they did this time were the Hgb and Hct. They were both low.\\nOnly 18 days post op after losing all the blood, so hopefully, the initial blood test was off....and the 10.6 is actually up. ha! He has an appt on Tuesday to see the ENT, and he he doesn\\'t understand the levels, then we may see a hematologist. thanks for the raisin note\\n\\nHemoglobin can vary a little from one test to the next, especially if they are just doing the one drop of blood test that they do at the donation center.\\n\\nIt could take another couple months for his iron to come back up to what it was before.  How is he feeling?  Is his energy returning at all?\\nhis energy level is better, but not at all what it used to be.  Problem is, he has soooo much to do the within the next few weeks, leaves for College on 8-6 where they will expect him to be at his best! boy...they will be surprised....the best news..he has only lost 10 pounds....gym every day the next 3 weeks will help his stamina I am sure....Doctor appt on Tuesday, so more news after that appt. Good news I hope!\\nsimple tonsillectomy turned into a nightmare....still cannot believe this!\\nI know what you are going through. Two years ago, my son who was five at the time, got very sick. It was a whirlwind of going to the doctor for what we thought was a bad bug - to a ct scan that showed fluid in his stomach. They rushed us to the children\\'s hospital and it was pancreatitis. It is very rare in children. His pancreas enzyme levels were higher than any of the doctors had EVER seen.\\n\\nIt was very scary - but we made it through and he got better. It just took time. He wasn\\'t himself for about a month of two. But now he is just a normal little boy again. Praying for your little one and you, and for wisdom for his doctors. Sometimes you just gotta have a little faith. Easier said than done I know - but from a mom whose been in those oh, so scary shoes - it will all work out.\\n\\nBrooke\\n2 Corinthians 12:9\\nAlso just a quick little note - when I gave birth to our son, I lost 4 pints of blood. It took me almost two months to get my iron back up.\\nDoctor appt today, he apologized for the bleeding.  Said it would take 2 to 3 months to get his count back up.  He is getting his stamina back at the gym. His blood pressure was 150/80 at the hospital, which they attributed to the trauma, although this was the same reading he had today, so I guess this is something else we will need to monitor.\\nSo hopefully he is on the road to health again.\\nthanks everyone!',\n",

       " {'post': 'I am wondering if anyone takes metoprolol in a real low dose. I was taking 12.5 mg twice a day. Now I take 6.25 mg twice a day. I have to cut the pill into 4ths which is not so easy. Does taking 6.25 mg lasts for 12 hours until next pill? I had seen my dr a few weeks ago and asked that and he seemed okay with it. I asked a pharmacist who said with that low dosage and if your bp is okay, one wouldn\\'t need to take it at all. I was put on metoprolol after lisiniprol(on it for one month) made my bp too low and my heart rate was up so a PA changed it to metoprolol. I have been on it since January. I see dr next month and am hoping to get off it all together. Thanks, Pam\\nPemmy,\\n\\nwhat was your blood pressure before treatment? Is having an elevated blood pressure your only health problem? It would help to know why this particular drug was selected as your antihypertensive with so many others to choose from.\\n\\nFG\\nFG,\\nI don\\'t know how to make this short. We moved to TN 7 yrs ago and I never got around to getting a physical exam until 2 yrs ago. Last July, I had my exam. BP was okay. Lady dr left practice soon after. I was dealing with a nurse practioner and 3 PA\\'s before seeing the man dr. A few weeks ago, I talked to nurse and asked her to send me in office bp readings. July-2007 when I had my physical it was 120/88. Dr never said anything about that. My cholesterol was up so I saw the nurse practioner in Aug about diet. My bp was 134/96. My reasoning was I was nervous on seeing her as I knew what a cholesterol diet is and should have done it the year before. She said to monitor my bp. I did for a few weekends after that at Walmart and my bp was normal. I went back in Nov for cholesterol test to see her and my bp was 130/92. I told her that we were flying to NE for Thanksgiving and I have anxiety about flying. After we came back, I bought a homedics bp monitor. I did get some high readings. Then I got some error messages on it so I took it back. I went to see the nurse practioner in Dec and showed her the readings. She took my bp it was 108/76. She said something about spikes and of course, high blood pressure being a silent killer. She said keep monitoring it. I told her that I  had to fly out any day back to NE as my brother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. She felt my thyroid was enlarged and thought she heard a heart murmur so wanted me to have ultrasounds. I had those on Dec 10(both turned out okay but thyroid is bit enlarged-no nodules). That afternoon I had to come back for a pap smear done by a Physician\\'s assistant.IFor a couple of hours I worried about myself and my brother). My bp was 148/92. I did not know that at the time. She asked are you nervous. I had to explain about I might have to fly out any day and my brother had terminal cancer. She prescribed lisinipril. I was worried about being 30,000 feet up in the air and didn\\'t want to have a heart attack or stroke. I had been on it for a week and had to fly out. I went into dr office to have my bp checked before leaving. Saw yet another PA and my bp on lisinipril was 110/80. She took blood to test it.(Later found out I had high calcium). The night before I had to fly, I felt dizzy. Thought it was my bp but checked it with a new Omron bp monitor and it was okay. I felt sick after that but still flew back. I felt sick for a month-thought it was due to anxiety, stress over my brother and thought I had caught a cold as I got a terrible cough. I went to walk in clinic and my bp was 98/60 but the nurse practioner asked when I had taken the bp med and I said about an hour before I came in. She didn\\'t say anything about it. Gave me antibiotic prescrip because my throat was a little red. We flew home the next day and I went to dr after that. Saw yet another PA. My bp was low and my pulse was up. (I have to find out what it was). She changed it to metoprolol er(actually toprol xl but pharmacy gave me generic). I am guessing she gave that to me for the fast heart rate? I had to have a blood test for parathyroid hormone-turned out to be high. I was on metorpolol er 25 mg for 4 days and felt wierd and head sick. Called dr and talked to nurse. I was told stop taking it and come to see him on Monday. I did and he thought it was high calcium causing me to feel headsick. Changed it to reg metoprolol 25 mg but said take 1/2 a day. I still felt sick on it. I even came back into see him. I even thought my anxiety was getting to me. I got lexapro. Took it for 8 days and felt wired. Got heart palps at night. Called dr nurse to tell her. She didn\\'t think it was the lexapro but high calcium/parathryoid causing heart palp. I asked don\\'t I have to take metoprolol twice a day. She said you are on toprol xl. No, I am not. I even asked dr don\\'t I have to take it twice a day as it is not time released. He said it was okay. Well, finally after calling nurse again, I was told to take it twice a day.\\nAfter awhile, the head sick feeling went away. I still kind of got heart palps at night. Then dr said it was anxiety causing those. I have had ekg\\'s and fine. Even a holter monitor and it was okay-I was on metoprolol with that. I started taking magnesium at night to deal with heart palps. Seems to help. A few weeks ago, I had some low bp readings so I had asked if I could cut 1/2 pill in half and was told yes. I went to see dr to check my bp two weeks ago and it was 120/88. I had brought in my readings for the past two weeks(I alway says it\\'s my home monitor and it might not be accurate. I have brought my monitor in twice before to have a nurse and the dr check it and they get high readings on it. I think it was because they weren\\'t doing it right. Dr had me on his table and tube to my monitor was all twisted, etc.) I told him how hard it was to cut the pill into 4\\'s. He said he had another patient that is on 1/4 dose. I even asked should I go back to taking a half and he said no.  I asked if I could try getting off them. He was open to it but also asked if I wanted to try another med like Coreg. I had jury duty a week ago so didn\\'t want to try getting off the metoprolol. I don\\'t think I want to try Coreg. I am to go back to see him next month for bp check and get my cholesterol checked. I just don\\'t feel comfortable with him. I know I should find another dr. I don\\'t know too many people to find out who to go to as in a good dr.\\nI have had anxiety all my life and it\\'s worse now. I did get some xanax to take. I feel weird in my chest-guess worry about taking a beta blocker or any other bp med. My mom is 83 and has taken a med for a fast heart beat for over 20 yrs and has been on lisinpril for the last two years. My older sister has been on metoprolol er for around 5 yrs for bp and fast heart rate. She was able to get off it for awhile but was put on half dose for fast heart rate. Then her bp recently want up so she is on a full dose now-I think 50 mg. I am 54 so bp can go up with age and being menopausal and hormones flucuating. Hyperparathyoid disease can affect bp. Anxiety and stress could be a factor. If I have to be on a bp med, I just want to be on the right one and correct dose. If I don\\'t have to be on one, that would be great. I am wondering if the only way to find out is to wean off this and see what happens. I am trying to eat better, exercise, and do breathing exercises. Anxiety and worry are two of my biggest problems, too. I go back in July to endocrine surgeon to test blood for calcium and pth-have posted about that on thyroid message board. I might have to have surgery for that. So my worry now is cutting this small pill in accurate dose! Does anyone else take such a small dose? Sorry this is so long.   Pam\\nPemny,\\n\\nYou won\\'t be able to get the dose just right because of the cutting issue.  Just be sure & take your b/p before each dose so you can see if it is elevated excessively.  Also look for other signs of withdrawal like chest pain, palpitations etc.  Remember there is a drug reservoir in your body tissues after being on the drug for a month.  So the body can call on those reserves.  I had to go back & forth when I was withdrawing from some drugs.  That is I would have to take a larger dose one time if my b/p was up too much.  Then I would go back to the smaller amount.\\n\\nDon\\'t worry about your long post, those of us who have had similar things happen understand.  I think you are doing great considering what you are going through.  Your thyroid & parathyroid issues maybe fueling some of your anxiety.  I have thyroid issues so I understand some of those problems.  Just consider this a temporary thing that will eventually get settled.  Fam\\nHi Pam,\\n\\nyou seem to be right on top of things. No wonder anxiety has played a major role in your life, considering all that has been going on.\\n\\nYour blood pressure is generally good. An increase in parathyroid hormone will cause hypertension with blood pressure fluctuations. Perhaps the elevations that have been noted on occassion are normal blood pressure fluctuatios.\\n\\nMost people with parathyroid problems have symptoms, which, among others, include: kidney stones, headaches, depression, high bp which goes up and down a lot, inability to concentrate, bone  pain, GERD and heart palpitations - often atrial arrhythmias.\\nAlso, and this might apply here: heart rate of up to 200 beats per minute can accompany hot flashes during menopause. Your fast heart rate could be a result of hormonal changes, as you suspect. Episodes of an increased heart rate are also triggered by strong emotions, electrolyte imbalances and strenous exercise.\\nPalpitations happen when the stress hormone is released. Adrenalin makes the heart beat faster and with more force. This sometimes results in heart palpitations and arrhythmias. They appear as a reaction to psychological stress and do not signal heart disease. Other causes are coffee, tea and smoking, but usually palpitations are caused by anxiety, as your doctor believes to be the case.\\nYou mention anxiety numerous times throughout your sizable post.\\nIt is probably responsible for at least some of your current issues.\\n\\n\\n.\\n\\nCan a small dose of medicine be beneficial? It can. Can a tiny dose of an antihypertensive have any notable benefits? I am not sure. Would you be better off on another medication? Calcium channel blockers, verapamil and diltiazem, are also used to reduce heart rate.  Since you\\'ve been told to use only such a small dose of your current medication, even your doctor might be questioning your need for it. Isn\\'t that good to know?\\n\\nI hope things work out for you. Please keep us posted.\\n\\nflowergirl\\nThanks famnd and flowergirl for replying. I am not sure if I can take diurectics or calcium channel blocker because of the high calcium in blood/parathyroid. I will see my dr next month.\\nI was about to post a similiar question myself. Here\\'s my deal. 34 yr old male. I seemed to have anxiety issues about a year ago. I was getting the \"lab coat\" HBP of 150s/70s and even spiked at 170/70s at the doc\\'s office. My at home readings always seemed fine.\\n\\nThe doc decided to put me on 25mg of Toprol. It was great. Very minimal side effects. I was calm,collected and my BPs remained in check 120/60s. Now almost a year later, I\\'m starting to feel really lethargic, and uninspired to do just about anything lately. I feel boring because I just don\\'t feel anything! I\\'m not really happy nor am I ever really sad. Apathetic.\\n\\nJust for shiza and giggles I took my HR and it was in the 40\\'s.\\nI\\'ve never seen it so low. Waited a day, and the same very thing.\\n\\nLong story short, I\\'m going to split my pill in half and start taking 12.5 mg only per day because I think I\\'m actually being over medicated at this point.\\nSofa King, Are you taking the brand name Toprol or generic form metoprolol. Is it extended release as in Toprol XL or regular one. Let me know how it goes for you by cutting your dosage.\\nPam\\n\\nI tried to edit this once and it didn\\'t post. So here goes again. Are you taking toprol xl, the extended release pill. I don\\'t think you can split that because of the coating on it. Someone else might know more about that. I am taking regular metoprolol. Small pill with a line on it-kind of looks like a 1-where I can split it in half. You might want to check with your dr, too.\\n\\nOriginally, I was taking XL but now in the last 4 months I\\'ve been taking the metoprolol. I cut my dosage (25mg to 12.5) two days ago and now my HR has already risen into the 60s and I\\'m feeling better already. BPs are still normal.\\nI think I am dealing with a similar situation. Several weeks ago I experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure from my then normal readings of about high 120\\'s or low 130\\'s over 85 or so diastolic.\\nMy blood pressure has remained consistently low since - to the point of being symptomatic at times - dizziness, increased nausea or feeling disoriented. It is now in the  low 100\\'s or below. The diastolic is in low 60s to mid70\\'s. There have been no changes that I know of to my lifestyle, medication, or a level of physical activity.\\nAfter a two month wait to see my new doctor, I\\'ve just learned she is and will remain unavailable. So, I find myself without a doctor and running out of my meds. I have cut back on my medication (I chose to lower the ACE inhibitor) and don\\'t know where to go from there. I guess I\\'ll have to start looking for a doctor. I have done some reading about hypotension and \"seemingly\" unexplained changes in blood pressure. One cause of hypotension I was not aware of is an electrolyte imbalance (excessive magnesium levels specifically). Of course, the antihypertensives often cause hypotension also.\\nI don\\'t want to reduce the dose of the wrong medication - such as the beta blocker or the CCB and suffer the consequences (still fresh in my memory from last year). I\\'ve been thinking that perhaps I don\\'t need ANY medication (or doctors) at all...\\n\\nYour heart rate is\\n. No wonder you\\'ve been feeling lethargic and have no energy. You need to go on a different medication. Inform your doctor - don\\'t wait too long.\\n\\nflowergirl\\n\\nIt was pretty strange how quickly the onset of the lowering HR was too. The only thing I can attribute it to (other than the meds) was an increase in exercise. I stepped it up a few notches for a Vegas trip (poolside\\n) but other than that, I don\\'t know.\\n\\nI\\'m going to ride out my meds at a lowered 12.5 mg one time a day to see if I continue to improve HR while maitaining BP. If I see anything unusual, I\\'ll get on the horn to the doc.\\nFG,\\n\\nAre you getting enough fluid?  You need to see a Dr.  especially since you are getting symptoms.  Lack of potassium will decrease one\\'s b/p but I know at least one of your meds can cause an increase in potassium.\\n\\nI was busy working on the house this weekend & didn\\'t eat much.  I know  my potassium got low so now I\\'m playing catch up.\\n\\nRemember the the recipe for low b/p that you can always use.  I\\'ve had to do it several times in the past 5 yrs.  Drink 16 oz of fluid (water or some kind of easily absorbed fluid).  Drink the fluid within 15 min.  This always raises my b/p 20 points systolic for 2 hrs.  Fam\\n\\nSounds good! Would you please let us know what happens? Perphaps your blood pressure will return to its normal levels - thanks to your increased physical activity - and you won\\'t need any medication. That drop in blood pressure could be a result of your healthy lifestyle (sounds like you\\nlive up to your screen name...\\n) and is a goal a lot of us on this board have been trying to achieve.\\n\\nflowergirl\\nHi Fam,\\n\\n\\nI am not sure but it\\'s been hot here and I get thirsty a lot. I only drink water when on my breaks - just one small glass, which is probably not enough.\\nI would go see a doctor but don\\'t have one right now. I don\\'t know what my labs are. None have been done since very early January. I am supposed to have everything checked every 3 months at least. I resent finding myself in this position through no fault of my own.\\nYou are right, maybe my potassium is out of balance again. Perhaps I should say more out of balance than usual. I experienced hypotensive symptoms for several days last year when being treated for severe edema. My dose of Hctz had been doubled. This increased dose, combined with my other medications, resulted in a drug-induced hypotension. The doctor told me I\\'d have to put up with the hypotensive symptoms until the edema resolved itself. This meant staying in the house since I was too dizzy and sick to stand or walk.\\n\\nI still eat a lot of fruit and veggies. No problem there. Thank you for reminding me about the importance of adequate fluid consumption and your recipe. I\\'ll up my fluid intake - and do as you suggest.\\n\\nflowergirl\\nFG,\\n\\nAre you getting enough fluid?  You need to see a Dr.  especially since you are getting symptoms.

I had my calcium checked about a month ago it was fine, got it and my PT checked yesterday so am anxious for it to come back. My dr has to find SOMETHING that is making me feel this way!\\n\\nDoes it sound like I have the symptoms?\\nWell the symptoms could be from that.  I have same symptoms but dr norman replied he does not think I have parathyroid tumor.  When you get your labs post them and then it should give you an indicator.  If it is borderline.

       " {'post': 'Hello Ladies and Gentlemen,\\n\\nSpeak up boys!  We need a male perspective.  I promise not to bite!  Until we get men on board.. you all will just have to listen to the ladies nag and gripe!\\n\\nI am starting week TWO as promised!  First things first we learned in week one that getting treatment is never easy and you can not give up.  You must keep fighting if you have a family history of hypoT and your symptoms indicate it may be endocrine in nature.  So keep this thread in mind and continue to share your woes and what is or is not working for you.  Getting treatment is hard enough, getting competent and optimal care is even harder.\\n\\nI am including a summary of things learned in week One.  The general points are as follows (THE MG\\'s THYROID SCHOOL – Fondly taken from Apple):\\n\\n\\nOptimal is 50-80% of normal range.  This statistic comes from the N A C B where they determined 85 – 90 % of  non-dysfunctional thyroid MALES had TSH levels between 0.89-1.1.  Women of child bearing years need to have Fts in the 60-80% range of normal. Women after menopause tend to need slightly lower Ft values in the 40-70% range.  (This is just my  MFM and 2 Obs knowledge on this.. trying to dig up a public access postable journal article on this information) Many MDs do not know how to determine where you are in the normal range. So here is the formula you need to know and come to love.\\n\\nGiven the following formate:\\nFree T or Total T value (lower limit - upper limit)\\n0.85 (0.8-1.8)\\nYour percentage is calculated as follows:\\n[Your FT value - lower limit]/[upper limit - lower limit]*100 = %\\n[0.85 - 0.8]/[1.8-0.8]*100 = 5%\\nOptimal care is when your TSH is around 1 on a T4 supplement alone with Ft\\'s are in the 50-80% range of normal. T3 supplementation such as cytomel or Armour results in TSH suppression and as a result you must gauge thyroid supplementation on your T4 and T3 hormone levels and symptoms alone.\\n\\nHere is a summary of the A A C E and N A C B statements on the latest normal TSH range.\\nNovember 2002: The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry (NACB), part of the Academy of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry (AACC) was first to issue new laboratory medicine practice guidelines. This is their job so it is to be expected they alter the requirements MDs use for the diagnosis and monitoring of thyroid disease. The particular statements of interest in the 2002 guideline announcement are:\\n\\nNon-US Mds may turn their nose up at this information.. but it is always worth a shot.  This announcment and research was then picked up and reviewed by the A A C E. Based on the N A C B\\'s findings, in January 2003, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (A A C E) made the following important announcement that all the MDs should get.. but haven\\'t yet:\\nIt has now been 8 years since the original N A C B guidelines release, many laboratories have not yet adopted these new guidelines for a normal range, and many physicians are either unaware of the A A C E announcement or refuse to change their procedures until the labs revise their standards. Many of the people on this board can tell you that you can not trust or expect your MD to know this fact.  Let them know you know!\\n\\nAn article that may help:\\n\"Thyroxine treatment in patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism but thyroid function tests within the reference range: randomized double blind placebo controlled crossover trial.\"\\n[url]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11668132?dopt=Abstract[/url]\\n\\n\\n\\nMy personal non-MD opinion and answer:\\nNot necessarily. The TSH and antibodies production mechanisms are not directly linked.  My layman\\'s explanation on the matter is the TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone). This is the pituitary function call to the thyroid that screams out.. HEY! I NEED MORE T4, MAKE IT NOW! The thyroid then responds by activating its production enzymes.. TPO and TG. Now the thyroid begins to produce more T4 so the TSH will decrease.  In the case of Hashimoto\\'s your immune system sees the TPO and TG as a threat to your system. So every time the TPO and Tg are activated, TPOAb and TGAb are produced to attack and destroy the thyroid. How long and how high the antibodies go is up to your body. Prophylactic treatment of my Hashimoto\\'s may have saved my adrenal glands and no telling how many years of dysfunction symptoms.  Studies indicate this may be true in others as well.  Here is a national institute of health study on the matter.\\n\\n[url]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11327616[/url]\\nThe acredited referreed publication on this matter:\\n\"One-year prophylactic treatment of euthyroid Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis patients with levothyroxine: is there a benefit?\" Thyroid, 2001 Mar;11(3):249-55\\n\\nALL that an MD can tell for certian is whether or not you have antibodies present.  If you are positive in TPOAb or TGAb you have Hashimoto\\'s.  This means your immune system is attacking your thyroid and will kill it eventually.  WHEN?  Well that is as individual as you are.  Depending on how many you have... the destruction of your thyroid could be near complete... just beginning.. or at its peak.  Anything over 1000 is seen as BAD. When levels get this bad.. added AI side bonuses should be looked for.\\n\\nOther common issues with Hashimoto\\'s:\\n1) Hashimoto\\'s is know for thyroid flares, oscillations between hyperT and hypoT states.  Some MDs referr to this as Hashitoxicosis.. others say Hashitoxicosis is having Graves and Hashimoto\\'s disease.  What Hashitoxicosis means is you have hyper and hypo thyroid episodes and medicating will be a constant adjustment issue.\\n2) Mild to moderate “joint and muscle pain”. This particular symptom is also one of those that seems to linger in some patients, months or even years after starting treatment for their hypothyroidism, with hormone replacement medication.\\n3) Some patients actually experience a worsening of their joint/muscle pain, once beginning thyroid medication.  I had this happen.  I am not sure if it is the fact I went so hyper after adjusting to 75 mcgs or just a side bonus of being thyroid dysfunctional and my body not liking the fact i am trying to keep it normal.\\n4)Most patients see improvement of rheumatic symptoms with hormone replacement therapy to treat their hypothyroidism but if relief is minimal, they may to be tested for co-morbid arthritis, including the autoimmune types.\\n\\n\\nWell when I go hypoT because my t4 and t3 levels are not right for me.. my pitutary gland calls to my ever growing thyroid by way of a TSH shout out. \"Hey, Thyroid.. need some more T4 get cooking!\" The thyroid sighs and thinks about it.. then tries to do its job. In Hashimoto\\'s patients and my case the thyroid activates the TPO enzymes begin to make and release T4. It is at this point my 2000 lazy and bored TPOAb and TGAb perk up and yell, \"ATTACK!\" Or whatever they scream as they charge and attack. It is at this point that my thyroid feels full and aches, it is a continual process that starts out more intense in the morning and lessens as my T4 supplementation takes away some of the burden.   The throb, pulse, ache and swellen in that area just at the base of your throat bracketing your wind pipe is classic thyroiditis.\\n\\nI hope this helps you help yourself.  Now how did you all get treatment and how is it going?\\nMG\\nThyroid and pregnancy.\\n\\nUgh!  I am going to point you to my long winded posts on this matter.  Save on typing it all again.\\n[url]http://www.healthboards.com/boards/showthread.php?t=585150[/url]\\n\\nAdrenal and thyroid dysfunction.\\nMy story and search on things is here.\\n[url]http://www.healthboards.com/boards/showthread.php?t=585294[/url]\\n\\nI think that is all for the moment.  I will add as needed.  Also make sure you look into good sleep hygiene and sleep disorders.  They can go hand in hand with thyroid issues.  Sleep deprivation alone can give you a fit.\\n\\nMG\\nMKG-\\nThank you for the great info on hashi\\'s. Your descriptions of the assault are quite helpful and funny too. Sometimes a bit of humor helps esp. when you are under assault! One thing I wanted to ask you is about constriction of the thyroid with hashi\\'s. I tried to get this question to your attn. last week but it got lost in alot of messages. My TPO antibodies were around 2500, then went to 1250--I\\'ll be tested in a few weeks to get current numbers. Let\\'s just say I am feeling under major attack, and recent swelling in a  neck lymph gland was said to be related to hashi\\'s. I have 7 nodules 2-8mm. OK so now to the queston , what about thyroid constriction??\\nOver the past 16 months , on treatment 75mcg synthroid and now 88-----one lobe has reduced by 54% and the other by some 20-30%.Now the lobes are roughly same size. I don\\'t have the numbers in front of me right now. Anyway at first u/s they noted normal size thyroid. This last  u/s  they noted small thyroid.\\nIn searching I found some info that the attack can cause scarring of thyroid tissue and that scar tissue has a tendency to constrict. That this constriction may lead to constriction of airway and esophagus and then thyroid removal would be advised. I wonder do I need to wait for such constriction or symptoms to get a removal or should I check into this now before worse happens.\\nSince my thyroid is dying anyway and it has so many nodules to be watched AND the endo cannot seem to get my levels stable--why not just refer me to the ent for thyroidectomy-\\nWhat do you think about my situation AND do you know anything about constriction?\\nHey Osteo,\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t help I was out of town for a bit and came back to a flood of people in need.\\n\\nConstriction can happen also as the thyroid is killed off the lobes can atrophe and harden causing issues.  As to your case the fact that they are decreasing in size as meds increase may just be an indicator that you are getting close to where you need to be on meds and inflammation is going down.  Now if in addition to this size decrease you are feeling constriction and pressure on your esphogus then something needs to be done.\\n\\nAre you having issues swallowing?  I am since starting meds my ENT was hoping things would shrink and get better they have not.  My left side was below normal size on my first scan.. I have no idea what size it is now.  My right was enlarged with a singular nodule.  I feel my thyroid constantly and have been having issues swallowing and eating this last month.  Also of note I am going hoarse more often as well.  It is not post nasal drip either.\\nMy Allergist and neurologist are looking and interviewing Endos in other states for me (Georgia and Alabama).  Mean while I am in my own driver\\'s seat with this thyroid adrenal mess.\\n\\nI am going to be going back to my ENT after my next rounds of labs and asking what he recommends.  Once the nodule was determined the physical structure and state of my thyroid was placed in his hands.  Medication and hormone balance are in my hands and my IMs hands.  My endo was hands off to begin with.. so I am not even having my blood work and scans sent to her anymore.. after all why waste the paper when in her opinion it isn\\'t my thyroid that is an issue, my TSH is too normal.\\n\\nI believe in second opinions and given your issues and the state of your thyroid would request to see an ENT.  You do not have to have your Endo make the recommendation your GP or IM or OB can do it.  I think I would press for its removal if I were you.  My MFM believes if you can not get set in meds on 9 months.. something else may need to be done.  He is expecting my thyroid to come out this summer.  I want the da..ng thing out.\\n\\nThe main thing to worry over with constriction and lobe atrophe is how it works into the vocal cords if you are having vocal issues you need to get to an ENT either by ordering a second opinion through the Endo or by using another MD.  MDs are only human.  I will not trust just one with my care any more.  I make sure all my MDs know wht the other is doing and see them all at least once a year.  This allows me to get as many opinions on the issue as possible.  My MDs ruling opinion in my case is I am screwed up.\\n\\nMG\\nMy situation is different than yours. I have been on meds for a yr. and a half already and can\\'t get stable. But it is also similar to yours  in a way-I want it out. But, I worry about negative effects of surgery.\\nDo you know whether in a case where they are not removing for cancer but because of hashi\\'s instability and various nodules-would they take out less than the whole --would it be what I have heard is called a sub total? I don\\'t understand what a sub total is -do you. It seems like something difft. than a lobectomy.\\n******** - thank you so very much for all your info and for sharing, you are a gem\\n\\nI simply can\\'t get over how much there is to learn.  I\\'m Hashi\\'s too, but without the complications at this stage which yourself and osteo are experiencing.  I have got the adrenal complications though and a pancreas not giving off sufficient enzymes to digest protein.\\n\\nI have been trying to read many of the other posts here and trying to educate myself, but i think it will be a while before things sink in.  It doesn\\'t help that all of this has depressed me and i\\'m finding myself getting a bit over emotional at times when i think of everything.  Normally i get a grip on things and just get on with it, but about twice per day now i tend to go through a moment of feeling sorry for myself and end up a bit teary.  I think it\\'s the fact that it\\'s taken so long for a doctor to finally take me seriously and i thought it would be a simply thyroid issue and not the adrenal and pancreatic issue thrown in.  Also it\\'s likely beginners fear, fear of the unknown and not knowing what to expect and not wishing to simply leave things in the hands of doctors, eventhough i have a fantastic one.\\n\\nLook forward to reading more of your posts, thanks again\\n\\nHi Osteo\\nhope you are doing well despite the thyroid issues.\\nWelcome to our dysfunctional thyroid FAMILY Audrey!  You are never alone.  Pop in here at the low points.  I have them as does everyone else. It helps to think ahead and try to ignore the hair clogged drains and other issues.  Finding things to do and focus on other than the propblem helps me.  This board is a big outlet in that regard.  i can focus on others.  My five year old son is another outlet.  My hobbies etc.  I am not as active as I once was and I am literally breaking down, but I refuse to give up and be beaten.  It is the only way to be in my opinion.\\n\\nOsteo,  I did the TT versus PT versus subtotal T a while back for my Aunt and mom.  One of the more recent surgical studies is, \"Total versus subtotal thyroidectomy for the management of benign multinodular goiter in an endemic region.\" By Colak T, Akca T, Kanik A, Yapici D, and Aydin S.  A public abstract is available at [url]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15550086[/url]\\n\\nThe conclusions they find is: a total thyroidectomy can be performed without increasing risk of complication, and it is an acceptable alternative for benign multinodular goiter, especially in endemic regions, where patients present with a huge multinodular goiter.  There was a 2% difference in chance of hypoparathyroidism in patients undergoing this procedure.  The main difference was TT\\'s on average stayed an extra day in the hospital.  Upside no need to come back for a second surgery.\\n\\nAnother thing of interest to look into is an MD that can perform \"Routine Parathyroid Auto-Transplantation During Subtotal Thyroidectomy For Benign Thyroid Disease\".  This is the title of an article you should search for..\\n\\nSo.. If I get the offer mine is coming out.  Only you can make your choice.  So research the MDs that would do this surgery, ask them what they would do if they were you.. or you were their mom.  Then choose.  It is all we can do.  Make a choice and hope it is the right one.\\n\\nMG\\nHi MG how are you, on the subject of hashi\\'s i am yet to find out if i have it and yes you are such a big help on the boared to everyone,these post are really a good idea so we can read through everyones  to see if we have things in common and we can get good info to help us help ourselfs and i think that was so nice of you to take the heading MG\\'s thyroid school from Apple i have read some of her post in the past and saw the one where she said that to you and you well deserve it you put a lot of time and effort in thanks kassikoo xx\\n\\nYour welcome.  This site is just a way to use technology to its fullest to get the information out and help and support each other.  I get just as much out of it as you all.  I am just glad I am in a position to help.\\n\\nMG\\nOne more neat fact.  Let us not forget our lunula\\'s.. the little moons on our finger nails.  I am back to hypoT and I am watching my lunula\\'s lighten and shrink on a daily basis.  The body can tell you so much.. you just have to be willing to listen to it.\\n\\nMG\\nI have no lunula\\'s. not even on my thumbs.\\n\\nGahhhhh...yet another reason to drop my endo. I asked her about swinging between hypo and hyper and what it would mean for my treatment if the hyper symptoms came back. She said that doesn\\'t happen in Hashimoto\\'s!\\n\\nStrike 2 on selecting a doc from Mary Shomon\\'s \"Top Docs\" list. Never again\\n\\nThank you for all the information. I read every night till my eyeballs just about fall out, and plenty of that is here on this board. I wonder if you know how much hope and help you give to people...I hope you do. And I hope it all comes back to you in many wonderful ways\\n\\nYour welcome and I am glad this thread is helping.  Finding the right MD is difficult you get more lemons and making lemonade is sour.  What city and state are you in?  My MD/Ph.D came back with an Endo in Alabama for me.  Elizabeth Ennis of Birmingham.  I can not give a personal referral of her yet.. but I will make an appointment after seeing my IM next friday.\\n\\nI got my IM off the Armpour thyroid physican locator database.  Her group was the only one in the area on it.  This doesn\\'t mean she is the only one that could treat me in town.  But she was the 6th in a line of duds and has done wonderfully.  I made sure to question my other MDs about who they would send me to and it was always another state or town or Dr. Jeffery Jump\\'s practice.  Word of mouth,  knowledge, and luck.  Persistance is a must in getting proper treatment.  If I wasn\\'t as physically compromised with this endocrine mess as I am I would go and become and Endocrinologist and make waves.\\n\\nI am glad I could help.  The Hashimoto\\'s your MD is probably used to seeing is after the thyroid is completely obliterated and anihilated.  At that stage there are no hyper swings.  No thyroid to kill no hyperT swings.  So many are made to wait and suffer and people do not bother to start looking at the thyroid until 40 or later.  You have to scream, kick, and bite to get noticed before then.  I cringe when I think of how many pregnant women and post pregnancy women suffer needlessly, because an MD refuses to listen and blames it on baby blues.\\n\\nAsk the MD what happens mechanistically when the thyroid tissue us destroyed?  How does this affect the surrounding thyroid tissue and your T4 and subsequent T3 levels?  Humm?  I would love to be a fly on the wall and watch her body language and verbal response.  Nothing like a chemist to make them run in circles.  The answer is inflammation and swelling of the thyroid.. which results in the lump in the throat throbing ache.. and an instant dump of retained T4 which is quickly converted into T3 in order for a quick burn off of excess T4.  Over conversion of T4 to T3 kicks in out of an ingrained survival response.  T3 has a much shorter life than T4.  Thus hyperT effects can be channeled and expediated in this manner.  Having a higher T3 than T4 level is common early on... and can become permanent if antibodies go after the adrenals in a polyendocrine attack regime.\\n\\nKeep fighting.  I just went hyperT again after a few days of hypoT.  WHee! Nothing like a day shift from hyperT to hypoT.  So unless I have Graves.. it is my 2000 some odd TPOAbs and TGAbs having a thyroid party!\\n\\nMG\\nI am in Baltimore, MD. I checked the Armour database and one of the first results was the first doctor\\'s office I went to with the ignorant PA (I\\'d even asked on the phone beforehand if she was good for thyroid issues and was assured she was...ha!). Eeek. I\\'ll make a few calls to others on that list and see what I can ascertain over the phone before making an appointment. I am tired of throwing precious money at closed-minded/ignorant practitioners.\\n\\nYour antibodies are sky high, wow! Some party\\nBest of luck with the new endo when you see her. I hope she is open-minded and progressive in her learning, and helps you greatly.\\n\\n\\n\\nI would LOVE to see that!\\n',\n",

       " {'post': 'I had a very severe headache and my primary care doctor sent me for an MRI.  The result was an \"enlarged pituitary.\"  I went to the neurologist on Tuesday, he said this is definitely a tumor.  I have had blood drawn, but don\\'t have hormone results yet.  My visual fields are fine, optic nerves are fine, and I have \"spontaneous venous pulsations\" indicating no increased intracranial pressure.\\n\\nI\\'m scared to death - I\\'m 33 and have a 2 yo son.\\n\\nAny of you have pituitary tumors?  How did you find out?  What was your treatment?\\n\\nTHANKS for any advice and/or information you have.\\n\\n\\nHi There:\\nI had MIR done 1 1/2 years before I was getting headaches and partials seizures. My test results were that I had a cyts close to the pituitary . Two week after a had a grand-mal seizure.For me they are not doing anything at the moment because a cyts not a tumor but am going other MIR pretty soon. Hopefully it has not grow. I am scared to death to so you are not alone. I wish All the best and keep in touch and I will too. One more they do not operated for nothing on your brain, they only do if it\\'s necessary.\\nDo not be afraid.  Pituitary tumors are actually quite common and very treatable.  Your course of treatment will depend upon what type of tumor you have.  They are catagorized by the hormone that they produce.  Acromegaly is caused by tumors that produce excess growth hormone, Cushing\\'s is caused by tumors that produce excess cortisol,  a tumor that does not produce excess hormone is a nonfunctioning tumor.  But even a non-functioning tumor may cause excess hormones by pressing on the pituitary stock.  With these types of tumors surgery will probably be recommended.  The surgery is very succussful, but make sure the surgeon does many of these procedures with a high level of success.\\n\\nThe most common type of pituitary tumor is a prolactinoma.  This type of tumor produces excess prolactin levels in the body.  But be careful, other types of pituitary tumor are often mistaken for prolactinomas because other types of tumor can also slightly elevate prolactin levels.  Prolactinomas can often be treated with medication alone.  Either Dostinex or parlodal.  Dostinex is the better medication, it is more effective with fewer side effects.\\n\\nWhen you are diagnosed with a pituitary tumor, the first doctor you want to see is an endocrinologist.  One who is a pituitary specialist.  You would be surprised how little some doctors know about pituitary tumors.  You want someone with pituitary experience.  Do not let a GP guide your treatment, they don\\'t understand pit tumors well enough.  Be sure to see an endocrinologist before you see a surgeon.  The endocrinologist will be able to more accurately diagnose what type of tumor you have and direct your treatment.\\n\\nI was diagnosed 2 1/2 years ago with a 2.1 cm prolactinoma encasing my carotid artery.  My prolactin level was 1200 at diagnosis.  Normal levels are below 30.  This is using the lab measurements used in the United States. So my tumor is definately a prolactinoma.  Many doctors get confused and falsely diagnose other types of tumor as prolactinomas, and thus treat the tumor incorrectly.\\n\\nI have been taking dostinex to treat it.  Some people don\\'t tolerate the medication, and end up having the surgery even if they have a prolactinoma.  In the first 6 months on dosinex, my tumor shrank to 1.5 cm.  After that there was no further shrinkage, but so far the medication has suppressed the excess prolactin and prevented the tumor from growing further.\\n\\nThis may be more information than you want right now, but I hope it is helpful.  If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.  Being a patient, I have learned quite a bit about these tumors.  Good luck\\n\\n\\n\\n[This message has been edited by nebulous (edited 03-07-2003).]\\nAre they stating that you have a pituitary adeoma?  Be careful.  I had an MRI in \\'98 and my physician believed this was what I had.  I was sent to a Neurosurgeon first, then and Endocrinologist for a 2nd opinion.  The surgeon described the surgery - they crack your maxilla (the bone between your nose and upper lip) to go through your nose and remove the adeoma in your cranium.  I then went to the Endo for my hormone levels - these were fine.  Physicians seem to be seeing this more and more.  A malfunction of Cortisol would be a red flag.  I think they should be looking at at least 7 hormone levels (GH, TSH, etc.).  Removing an adenoma could lead to more problems.  If this is the case, I suggest you get a second opinion and ensure that surgery is the LAST resort.\\n\\nMonitor this closely...\\n\\ngiupset,\\n\\nWhat did your diagnosis end up as?\\n\\nI am in no hurry to have surgery, so I\\'ll do the best I can to get an accurate diagnosis.\\n\\nTHANKS!\\nFollowup, all of my hormone levels are OK (though I haven\\'t gotten the Growth hormone results yet, but all indications are that this is OK, too).\\n\\nThanks.\\ngiupset,\\nPituitary adenomas don\\'t always produce excess hormones in the body.  Just because your hormone test came out normal doesn\\'t mean you don\\'t have a pituitary tumor.  A large percentage of pituitary tumors are non-functioning, which means they do not produce hormones.  These tumors can and do grow, and if you ignore it, your eyesight could eventually be affected.  You need to find out for sure if you have a tumor or not, and if you don\\'t get surgery, it needs to be watched closely to make sure it doesn\\'t grow.\\n\\nThere are different ways to treat a non-functioning pituitary tumor.  Some surgeons do go up through the upper lip (this is the old fashioned way), but now they mostly go directly up through the sinus(depending on the size and location of the tumor).  It is minumally invasive, and the recovery time is much faster.  They have really come a long way in improving the surgery.  Of course, you don\\'t want just any surgeon, you want one who is up on the latest procedures, and has a lot of experience with pit surgery.\\n\\nThere is also gama knife radio surgery, which is non invasive and targets radiation directly on the tumor.\\n\\nIf there is any chance you have a tumor, please don\\'t ignore it.  The earlier it is treated, the more chance of successful treatment.\\nHi All,\\nNo, a pit. adenoma does not always cause hormone malfunctioning, especially if it is a non-functioning pit. adenoma.  But if the hormones are fine and the adenoma hasn\\'t grown, doesn\\'t affect the eyesight, etc., what is the purpose of the surgery if it is not bothering the patient or showing any signs of malfunction??  That\\'s why I say this should be monitored closely meaning an MRI every now and then, watch for amenorrhea, GH deficiency, TSH, decreased eyesight/eye pain (due to pressure on the optic nerve).\\n\\nI\\'ve had one MRI with no change - thank goodness.\\n\\n\\n[This message has been edited by giupset (edited 03-10-2003).]\\nI agree, if the tumor isn\\'t growing and is not affecting vision or any other structures, surgery may not be necessary.  It is probably safe to just watch any tumor under 1 cm for awhile.  Just be sure to get a yearly MRI to keep track of it.  You don\\'t want to be surprised by a sudden loss of vision or a hemorrhage. Good luck.\\n',\n",

And followup radiation therapy is often needed and has a high likelihood of success.\\n\\nCourse I'm not a doctor,simply a lay person who comes from a  family with a fascination and interest in medicine.. and I do a lot of research and reading, but I would ask your surgeon to clarify.....\\n\\nzuzu\\n\\n\\n[This message has been edited by zuzu8 (edited 06-18-2003).]\",\n",

My TSH back then was 12.5 with T4 around 5 so I was in a bit of a shoddy state!\\nI am guessing those T's are both Totals?  Have you ever had your FREE levels tested?\\nA lot of times when on meds the TSH will go way down, but you really need to know where your FREE levels are since they are your actual thyroid hormones.  The total tests are bound and active and the active is a very small amount of that, the active is what your body can actually use.  If those are Free levels then yes, your T4 is quite low, even if its a total its quite low.  Wish you had the T3 range as well, sometimes if the T3 is higher than the T4 its because the body doesn't have enough meds and is converting as much T4 to T3 as it can to keep you going.\\nTPO antibodies would indicate Hashimoto's, TSI indicates Graves, you probably have Hashi's.\\nHi,  Just thought I'd throw in my 2 cents worth here.  Going by those labs results and the ranges it would appear that you're in Canada.  I live in Ontario Canada and my Free T3 range is 2.6 - 5.7 pmol/L.  I think those are standard Candian (metric) ranges.\\n\\nI have a somewhat similar problem.  Both my TSH and Free T4 are low too and yet my T3 is okay.

I'm finding it hard to get a doc who doesn't put so much worth in the TSH and gets nervous when it goes below range.  They don't get it.

It seems like the pituitary is not responding to the low T4 levels, and there could be many reasons for this - ie the brain is not picking up the signals and responding properly.  I would ask heaps of questions of your Dr and if you are not seeing a specialist then maybe demand to see one.\\n\\nGood luck\\nCould a nutricianist be of help?  The pituitary has a big job governing hormones.  Last night was reading about the anterior pituitary\\'s involvement in reproductive hormones.  Could they retest it to r/o lab error?

How are your enzymes?\\nOn thinking again and reading Gemi\\'s post, if you have other hormonal issues then the pituitary is THE MASTER gland and so it really could all come back to getting that one under control first.

Well, maybe one day I will.\\n\\nBonBe\\n\\n\\nI have been busy away from the computer, and just happened to pop in for a minute.\\n\\nHep C would cause low T3, not low T4.  Your T4 is low and TSH is suppressesd because the Armour has a higher ratio of T3 to T4 than what you appear to need.  The high level of T3 you are getting is suppressing your hypothalamus, and thus your pituitary isn\\'t producing enough TSH to kick your remaining thyroid gland into action to bring your T4 up some.  Lowering your Armour dose a little MIGHT help, but more likely, lowering the Armour and supplementing with some T4 such as Unithroid or Levoxyl might be the key to balancing your thyroid hormones.  For many people, a good starting point would be to cut the Armour in half and add 50mcg T4.  Adjust levels by shooting for Free T3 and Free T4 Just above mid-range and ignor TSH for a while.\\n\\nAs for the Pituitary, it is possible that you have a pituitary problem, BUT keep in mind that low thyroid hormones cause EVERYTHING to be sluggish, including the hypothalamus (which tells the pituitary what to do in many cases).  So, your other hormone balances may correct once T3 and T4 are both where they should be, the others may correct themselves.\\nHi Meep,\\nThanks for dropping in! I am glad you are OK!\\n\\nYou make these things so understandable! I am going to copy what you wrote and save it with my copies of lab results.\\n\\nOK, now I see why my doc asked me if I would consider going back on pure T4, however, I do seem to need at least some T3 (going by past experience where my T3 was low).\\n\\nThank you so much. Next doc visit, later this month, I will\\ndiscuss cutting my Armour intake in half and adding some Levoxyl (pure T4). I am sure my doc will go for it.\\n\\nBlessings, and thanks again! TF\\n\\n\\nGlad to help!\\nI hope the doc \"gets\" what I am talking about.  I know that when I was on Armour only, I had numerous symptoms that resolved when I switched to taking Unithroid and Armour.  My current dose is 1 1/5 Grains (90mg) Armour and 100mcg Unithroid.

Well I got very huffy and I think he took notice and said I will be right back after I consult with the doctor I was suppose to see. 25 mins later in comes the right doctor. I sat back down and he proceeded to ask a lot of questions (the right questions). He said he looked over all of my blood work from when I was first diagnosed with a thyroid condition and noticed that my TSH has always been normal(not elevated) and that my T4 has always been low, which he said could be a possible pituitary problem.  So more testing and hopefully some answers.\\nI haven\\'t had either done yet. I just had bloodwork done.\\nI am the same way. When I was diagnosed with Hashis, my TSH was only 1.4. Only one time has it climbed any higher than that and that was when I came off all meds to have scan done. Even then it was 2.107. My old Endo always blamed my low T4 on the Armour, but new Doc seems to think it may be something else.

You just have so much skin to skin contact feeding the baby that you just do not want to be touched anymore. Most of my friends who breast fed felt this way also.\\nThe only time it is likely to have a negative effect hormonally is if you have PPD, because the lack of estrogen will make the lows lower.  Other than that, the LACK of hormones that breastfeeding causes is a nice little respite from the normal ups and downs we women get durring our cycles.\\n\\nIt can cause vaginal dryness, but a little Astroglide or something similar takes care of that (I really dont recommend KY because it turns sticky very quickly and is almost worse than the dryness was in the first place!)\\nhi girls. i thought breastfeeding helped with baby blues , not depression..thats a whole other ballgame. i have a tendency for anxiety and i know it helped that. i breastfed all 3 of mine. i think it helps your body get slowly back to normal...not so abruptly.\\nI had no negative effects whatsoever and the pregnancy weight and then some fell off rapidly.

This actually raises your metabolism, if everything is working right so that the extra energy yout body need to produce mil to feed the bay can be produced withoug running you down.\\n\\nIf your thyroiud gland was already weak (as sometimes happens right after a pregnancy) then it won't be able to keep up and you may go hypo.  It does happen.  IT isn't necessarily caused by the breastfeeding, but the high prolactin levels necessary to support breast feeding, along with the other hormone changes brought on by givung birth, can cause a dormant thyroid problem to surface a little more quickly.\",\n",

       " {'post': \"This may sound like a dumb question, but here I go. Do you really lose the after baby weight faster when you breastfeed? I breastfed my first child, but I hated it so bad it only lasted about a month. My friend breastfed her girl for almost a year and she was so skinny it was gross. It took me exactly one year to lose the baby fat. I am 28 weeks now and I really want to try again with breastfeeding, but I am nervous that a I will hate it again. Knowing that I can lose the weight faster will motovate me. so... is it true?\\nI'm a breastfeeding mother and I had a c-section. Its been 18mths and I'm not only down to my pre-pregancy weight I lost another 10pds. I'm sure not all breastfeeding mothers experience weight lose but the reason why you do lose weight while breastfeeding is the fact that your body has to work to produce milk and its a source of calorie burning.\\nAlso if it helps even though I didn't have much pain during breastfeeding my son was very stubborn his first couple of months and wouldn't take to the nipple, so I had to use a rubber nipple for his first two months. The rubber nipple takes alot of that rawness and pain away and there are alot of baby-safe creams out there as well that you can apply. I wish you th best of luck!!\\nSlaughter17, It's TRUE!  I read that your body burns off 1500 - 2000 calories per day just producing the milk to breastfeed and that's where the weightloss comes in.  That's enough motivation for me to try!\\n\\nTrio\\nTRUE!  Breastfeeding helps your uterus retract to the way it was before get pregnant!  I'm not sure how, but you definitely lose more weight breastfeeding than you would if your didn't - the saggy boobs are worth it!\\n\\nActually it is only partially true not all bfing moms lose weight.  I didnt bf but I know a few friends who did and only aobut half of them lost weight while bfing.  The ones that didnt were upset because they had heard that all women who bf will lose weight. Well after talking with their doctors they found that not all women do.  It just varies just like stretch marks vary,weight gain varies and so on.\\nMy first son refused to bf but I still lost most of my weight during the month following his birth but I gained alot back once I started on a certain birth control. I have seen others who didnt bf lose the weight like it was nothing.  It is going to vary and no one can say for sure if it will happen for you or not.  Granted the odds are in the favor of it but dont count on it as your sole way of losing weight.\\nWhen my friend was breastfeeding she said she craved a lot of sugar. I don't think that would help in trying to lose the weight.\\ni found breastfeeding was better than bottle feeding until i was ready to go out and do things without baby.. i had to start pumping..hated that.. but with my daughter i lost 16 pounds in the first week of her life by breastfeeding.. i breastfed for four months and got to three pounds below my pre preg weight. im doing again with this baby when its born.. some women may not lose the extra weight though.. the only reason some do it because its just like when you are preg.. you have to intake more calories a day than the average person.. and you burn more.. if you are overeating.. you will not lose weight..may gain it.. eat normal and only when you are hungry.. then youll be burning extra pounds just by breastfeeding. i dont know how anyone can hate nursing though. its easier. you can just move baby into your bed at night to feed.. no gettin gup to get bottle.. diapers are terrible with bottles compared to breastfeeding.. and you get to share something with baby no one else can.\\nThanks for all your replies! The only reason I didn't like breastfeeding was I felt like I was constatly sitting on the couch either feeding or pumping. I hardly got a chance to do anything else...She fed for about 45 minutes then I had to pump. I had too much milk at first then my milk started to diminish. I just hated sitting there all the time. I didn't ahve the patience for it. I did enjoy the closeness I felt with her and it was the most beautiful thing I have ever done in my life. I really want to try again and stick with it. I have heard the first few weeks are the hardest. I hope I can get through them. Thanks again for all your help!\\nSlaughter, it does feel like that in the beginning, but it gets so much better. It took me about 8 weeks to get the hang of it. Now I actually look forward to feeding my son. We're in our fourth month of exclusive breastfeeding and I don't plan to stop anytime soon. Also, I've lost all of my pregnancy weight and I can eat anything I want and am easily maintaining my weight.\\nHi, I am going to get a little vain now, so bare with me. I tried to BF with my son, but my nipples were SO inverted, there was no way. Now my vain question is, do your boobs get saggy from BF or is that an old wives tale? How do you try when you are in my condition? (And yes, I wore the plastic thingys for four months with no help) Anyone go through this?\\nHi slaughter17,\\nI lost all my pregnancy weight and then some within 3 weeks after my son was born.  Some women do...some women don't.  He's 4 months now and I'm exclusively bf'ing and love it.  It was not easy at first.  He wouldn't latch on and I was in tears because the first few days of his life I had to feed him formula.  I felt like I was failing him.\\n\\nThen my wonderful sister-in-law gave me a breastpump.  I tried it and I was soooo excited that I had milk!  I'll never forget the first time I fed him my milk\\nI just kept pumping and trying to get him to latch on.  Finally we got it and thank god, no more pumping!\\n\\nSo I know what you mean when you say you felt like you were just sitting on the couch all the time.  That's exactly what I was doing.  But try to stick it out ok.  Its sooo worth it.  Once you get past the first few weeks it seems soo easy and natural.  Am I preaching?? SORRY\\n\\nBabs\",\n",

Not a goood thing, considering that a woman can ovulate at ANY point after giving birth. I believe the earliest documented case is 27 days after.\\n\\nSo... breastfeeding is a semi-reliable form of birth control.\\nYou have to 1. be exclusively breastfeeding (feeding more than 8 times daily), 2.

I don\\'t know what to do at all.\\n\\nThanks in advance!\\nI looked it up in Taking Charge of Your Fertility and according to this author it is also important that your baby has limited pacifiers and supplements (like water) because the baby has to suckle at least every 4 hours during the day and every 6 hours at night.  She goes on to say that full breastfeeding means no supplements/pacifiers.  But then says extensive studies have shown that the contraceptive effectiveness of LAM is maintained even if your breastfeeding is nearly full (you supplement no more than 15% of all feedings.)  But she says to aim for full.  With all these factors it has a failure rate of less than 2% a year.\\nI hope this helps you make your decision!  Maybe in the future you can chart your cycles while you breastfeed as an extra check.  (The book says its up to you since the failure rate is so low anyways.)\\nWell let me just tell you I know how you feel!! I am exclusively breastfeeding as well. We actually choose to have un protected sex. The only BAD thing about exclusively breastfeeding is that there is no way to chart your cycles or know if you\\'ve ovulated, IF your periods have not returned. I am one that while breastfeeding DOES NOT have a period BUT YET ovulates. I was pregnant again by the time my 3rd child was 7 weeks old. Unfortunately I lost that baby when my baby was 3 mos old. This time around I have yet to get pregnant but am sure that I\\'ve ovulated. I know my body\\'s aches n pains n cramps well enough now. My only suggestion to you if the pill is an option use the mini pill (safe while nursing) and some type of barrier method if its not too much of a problem. Better safe than sorry. Using breastfeeding as a method of birth control is playing with fire. (believe me my butt is burnin\\n)\\nJust know that the risk is very slim although there!!\\nMaybe you had a luteal cyst?  That is the only way I know of where it is possible to ovulate and not get a period about 14 days later if you aren\\'t pregnant.\\nmaybe you can pump a supply\\nhey alliemay\\n\\nthe book The Art of Natural Family Planning has an entire section dedicated to natural child spacing and it is VERY clear and has a lot of clinical evidence for exclusive breast feeding to prevent pregnancy, sometimes up to two years. i recommend you get it ASAP and consider the options...that\\'s what my husband and i have planned to do\\n\\nthe book also says you CAN tell when you ovulate after you\\'ve had a child and you are exclusively breast feeding...you body gives the same symptoms it did before you were pregnant, you just need to be sure to check every day and watch them closely.\\n\\nit is possible\\n\\ni wish you the best and encourage you to give your baby the best food available, your own milk\\n\\nthere are always other options than the Pill',\n",

One is 2 1/2 years old and the other one is 3 weeks. My dr both OB and peditrician told me that formula is just as good as breast milk now adays. I like bottle feeding because it is more versatile.

I think that you are making the right decision for you.\\nI didnt breast feed either of my boys and if we do get pregnant again I wont breast feed that baby either.  The same reason as you,I had planned on breast feeding with my first son but for some reason he didnt want to breast feed.  I tried repeatedly and he just wasnt interested in the least.  I was fine with that until the nurses started to make me fel like a failure.  Yeah you read right,there were a few nurses that when I decided to stop trying and just bottle feed him brought in video tapes for me to watch about breast feeding,raved on and on how wonderful moms are that do and all the other lovely stuff that is raved on about with breast feeding. My DH and my doctor had to tell those nurses to leave me alone becuase they were upsetting me.\\nBoth of my children have been very healthy.  Dh is fine with me not breast feeding since he saw what happened with our first son.\\nYou can point out to your DH that he will be able to take part in feedings sooner with bottle feeding than if you were breast feeding.  You can also point out that if all his friends\\' wives jumped off a bridge would he expect you to follow???  I know mean to say that but he cant honestly expect you to do what others are doing just because they are doing it.  Another idea is have family who saw you struggle with your dd and the depression talk to him to maybe get him to understand your side more.\\njstpeachey79 - Thanks for the support.

I think DH will come around, but I really can\\'t go through the trauma of trying to breastfeed, given my past circumstances and the implants. I don\\'t want to get into any arguments here with mothers who insist on breastfeeding, it is a personal choice. I just want to be reassured that I\\'m not alone. BTW, where do you buy your formula? I assume you\\'ve shopped around for the best prices.\\n\\nYes Ma\\'am - they say to start breastfeeding shortly after birth when the baby is most awake. I was not given that opportunity by the hospital. After that when we did start trying, she was too tired and disinterested in learning to breastfeed. Your milk doesn\\'t come in immediately, there is another substance for the first few days, so it wasn\\'t the breastmilk she didn\\'t take to, it was the actual feeding from the breast. My breasts were also really small at the time (thus, the breast augmentation a few years ago). I was also not offered the assistance of a lactation nurse. After she started losing weight, a really mean nurse told me I should just have them feed her formula and made me feel like I\\'m a horrible mother for not being able to breastfeed my baby. My whole experience with that doctor and hospital was really traumatic and I will NEVER go back there, but it also scarred me and I don\\'t want to go through that again. My daughter took the bottle immediately, but not the breast, so we kept up with the formula. It sounds like you have realistic expectations about breastfeeding and that\\'s great. Hopefully DH will come around and realize that breastfeeding doesn\\'t work for every woman.\\nBlastoff - That\\'s EXACTLY what happened to me! The nurses were downright MEAN and horrible to me, and it was a nurse who told me that my baby is losing weight because I\\'m such a terrible mother and I should give up on trying to be a good mother and just let the nurses bottle feed her. That\\'s right - the NURSES bottle fed her and did not even give me the option to do it myself. It was an aweful experience! I\\'m sorry that happened to you too.\\nUnfortunately, the only person who saw what I went through was my ex-husband, and he has no credibility with my husband, so he has to take my word for it. I also told him that it will be even more difficult this time around because of the breast augmentation and the nipple incision. You are right, there are definite benefits of formula over breastfeeding and it\\'s really not a bad alternative. Some people just have very strong opinions (his friends\\' wives included), but I don\\'t bother with what everyone else thinks. I\\'m just trying to get him to understand from a practical standpoint why we need to spend the money on formula. It\\'s expensive, but if I can\\'t breastfeed what else are we going to do?\\nHi I am also going to be a NON breast feeding mother...I am pregnant with my 3rd child and refuse to go through the misery again..With my son ( he is 18 now ) I just could not get him to attach properly, he was losing weight, I was a nervous wreck and basically the first few weeks of his life was a misery for both of us\\nWith my daughter last year I attempted to breast feed again SAME THING AGAIN ! I could only get her to latch on to my right breast and that wasnt properly either....I too was made to feel like chit by the nurses after I finally said OK THATS ENOUGH ! I want to be able to bond with my baby, not have us going through hell ! The nurses were absolute ******* to me\\nBefore I had given up on the breast feeding, if I wanted to go downstairs to the shop or pop outside to get some fresh air ( I hate the stifled air of hospitals ) they would gladly watch my daughter, as soon as I started bottle feeding her, they refused and outright told me that they werent a babysitting service !!!! So because of all this I have decided I am not going to even attept it this time ! Also having my daughter who will only be about 13 months old when my son is born, I just think it will be too much to go through the misery and cope looking after 2 babies !\\nI am undecided on the issue, either way I plan on pumping if I am unable to get the baby to latch. Even if only for a few weeks, my outlook is, hey I tried and it\\'s not for me and I am ok with that. If everyone else can\\'t deal, tough! It\\'s like everytime I go to the WIC office the nurse asks, \" Are you going to breast feed?\" I say I plan on it but no guarentees. I feel like if I say I am undecided I may get a boob ripped off! My only fear is that my baby would have to have soy formula, I can\\'t take the smell of it. I get a bit quesy when I smell babies that are soy fed. But, I guess it\\'s got to be that way if nothing else.\\nHaleysmum - that\\'s how I feel this time around. I don\\'t want to go through that again and don\\'t think I should be made to feel inadequate because of it. I just don\\'t even want to attempt it this time around. I feel relieved to know that there are other moms out ther who are in my situation as well. Thanks!\\nWell I did get lucky and when it came to bottle feeding my first son I did it.  I told hte nurses I wanted to be the first to give him a bottle since the breast feeding didnt work out.  With my second son since we knew from the get go that we woudl bottle feed so we got to be the first to give him that as well.\\n\\nThat sucks that your ex was the only one to see that there were problems last time.  I am sure your Dh will come around.  Another idea is you can see if your PS will talk to your Dh about your augmentation and let him know that it will be harder for your to breast feed.  I wish you the best on this.  Dont feel bad because there are plenyt of us out here who have been in your shoes in one way or another.\\nI didnt breastfeed my son. He is almost 7 now though. I am not sure why - my milk never showed up. He was 3 months early, and although he was fairly healthy, etc. The nurses tries to guilt me into breastfeeding. I didnt feel comfortable with it. They pretty much forced me to try it, and it only made things worse. My son is healthy now, and he was fed only formula. I am prego again, due in April, and I dont intend to breastfeed this one, either. It is a personal choice. We, as mothers, are the ultimate decision makers in this. If you dont want to do it, dont do it.\\nI might be able to..breast reduction 2 years ago\\nNIce to hear positive responses towards a mom who isnt going to breastfeed. I didnt breastfeed my 2 children, and to this day i feel like I have to defend myself for making that choice. Im selfish, inadequate, whatever! I knew alot of women who felt that my choice made me a bad mom. I dont care if someone breast or bottle feeds. It is a personal choice.  I dont have the time or energy to judge someone on this issue-Im too busy trying to raise my kids. Do what you feel you need to do. and dont listen to anyone. Its your body and your baby, and you dont have to answer to anyone else. Im lucky, hubby didnt care (he liked doing feedings too though) and had he tried to pressure me, I would have been pretty ticked.\\ndont feel guilty about it.  I chose not to breastfeed and everyone asks me why and sometimes I feel bad about it but it\\'s your choice, I\\'ve never heard of a baby who suffered cuz a mom never breast fed just tell who ever asks it\\'s not of there business\\nDH insists that children are more suseptible (sp?) to allergies, etc. if they are not breastfed. At this point, I\\'m not going to put myself through the trauma of trying to breastfeed all over again.',\n",

Constantly wondering when the next wave of spasms or cramping will occur must be an emotionally draining ordeal, only compounding your physical pain and incapacitation.\\n\\nI noticed in your list of the diagnostic tests that you have had performed, that you have not had any EMG studies, myelography, or muscle biopsies.  Have you been seen by a neuromuscular specialist, or only general neurologists?\\n\\nI found all sorts of interesting and possibly pertinent info upon entering \"unexplained muscle spasms\" into a search engine.  Other tests including serum measurements of potassium, magnesium, and muscle enzymes might be helpful, as well as thyroid and parathryoid function tests, and kidney function tests.  Possible diagnoses to pursue might be muscular cramp fasciculation syndrome (although I think this does not involve weakness of the affected muscle(s), myokymia (I found this one particularly interesting because its hallmark is the visual evidence of the rippling of the muscle while in spasm), mitochondrial disease, motor neuron disease, myotonia, and many more that I should have written down and not relied on my so-called memory to remember.\\n\\nI suspect that your quest for a diagnosis has just begun.  I know how frustrating that sounds, but I also know from experience that\\nis worse than just about anything else.\\n\\nI don\\'t know where you live, but please try to make an appointment with a neuromuscular specialist at a teaching hospital, if at all possible, even if it means having to go out of state.  In the meantime, you might want to do some online research to see if any of the many neuromuscular and muscle diseases seem to \"fit\" your own history and symptoms.\\n\\nActually, if you haven\\'t already done so, you might want to start with the Resource Links section on the HealthBoards home page.

I would like to know just how bad mine are compared to others.\\nHI,\\nMy T scores are comparable to yours - not too good. Spine -3.8 at the worst level and -1.6 in my hip. Was anyone able to get a DEXA test that tested below L 3/4? I\\'m afraid the further down, the worse my score is. Just wondering.\\nMy T scores about a month ago were -2.6 in the hip and -4.5 in the spine.  I am 50 years old. I am not looking forward to the coming years.\\nI am 34, my hips are -1.4 and my spine is -2.5\\n\\nBoth of my sisters (ages 44 and 37) also have osteopenia.  It\\'s funny all of our doctors have different opinions.  We share them with each other and try different things.  I\\'m not nearly as worried about it as I was when first diagnosed (a few months ago).\\n\\nMy oldest sister\\'s hips were -1.9 and her hips are -1.4 - but her numbers have gone up with diet and exercise only.\\n\\nMy other sister hasn\\'t had a full scan, but her wrist scan showed the density to be -2.5\\n\\nAre you on any medication now??   If so, have your scores changed while on medication?\\n\\nFor the full story, see my post \"need general info,\" also on the osteoporosis board.\\nI am 58.\\nMy T scores  were ; spine L1-L4  -4.46 in 02  -3.78 in 04   I was greatly relieved by this result.\\n\\nhip total     -2.87 in 02   -2.94 in 04   Not so good but stable-ish ?\\nHoping this trend will continue.\\nThe good news is, no fractures at all to date. I think the consensus is, if you have had one fracture you are at greater risk of more.\\nNow 4years since my parathyroidectomy.  Last 2years on HRT.\\nI found that, 6months taking Fosamax, 6months after surgery,  made me feel like I had parathyroid disease again and did not increase BMD. Stopped the fosamax, against my consultant\\'s advice .So glad I did.\\nI try to keep as MOBILE as poss. Immobility, bed rest, increases bone loss.\\nHi,  I am so glad to here about other peoples t-scores.  I have been trying to get some kind of info to compare mine.  I am a 57 year old female. My last bone density test showed my spine at -3.2.  My hips at -1.9. Left forearm at -2.2.  I have been on fosamax for about the last five years and on miacalcin for about 2-3 years.  Does anyone know anything about Z-scores?  My Dr. recently sent me to an endocrineologist.  What does a thyroid Dr. have to do with low bone density?  What is the lowest t-score for a spine that anyone has ever heard of?  I have also been on 1200-1500 mgs of calcium a day for acouple of years.\\n\\nThanks for any info.\\n\\nFrom what I understand, Z-scores are based on where your bone mineral density stands in relation to others of your age group. T-scores compare you with the young healthy population, who would be at their optimum BMD. The ages on which these scores are based seem to vary a bit between manufacturers of the DEXA machines, but it\\'s somewhere between 20-30 years old. Have you seen an increase in your BMD since you started Fosamax?\\n\\nThe reason you were sent to an endocrinologist is because two key glands of the endocrine system are responsible for secreting the hormones that regulate bone physiology. The thyroid secretes calcitonin and the parathyroid secretes parathryoid hormone; they maintain the balance of calcium and phosphorus and in turn regulate bone resorption.\\n__________________\\nAleta\\nDx Osteoporosis 5/04, age 49\\nT-Scores: Spine -3.0, Hip: -1.9\\nCurrent treatment: Evista\\nNewbie,\\n\\nI am 57 years old.\\nI had my first bone scan March of last year (2004).  The L1 vertebrae was\\n-2.8. The other lumbar vertebrae were in the osteopenia range. The L1 was of course severe osteoporosis. Over -2.5 is severe. I was devistated! I had no idea.  My Mother is 90 years old and has very severe osteoporosis. I should have had a bone scan 5 years ago.\\n\\nNow for the good news. Last year my Dr. put me on Fosamax. I\\'ve been taking the once a week pill.  I have had no noticable side affects. I take 1200  mg of calcium a day. I have been walking and I also ordered an exercise tape for the osteoporosis foundation web site that is great.\\nLast week I had my yearly bone scan.  The L1 vertebrae is now -1.9. That is a 10% improvement. The other sites have improved by 2% to 5%. That\\'s in 1 year!  I expect to be completely normal next year.\\n\\nI have read a lot of messages from women who are refusing to take the medications their Drs. are prescribing. They are concerned about the side effects. I understand. I was a concerned myself. But I am to young to make an invalid out of myself.  I\\'m sure people had concerns about the polio vaccine when it first came out.\\n\\nDon\\'t give up! Do everything you can to maintaiin your quality of life. I believe God has also had a part in my healing. Because my results after one year are truly miraculous.\\n\\nGod Bless!\\nMeeMee57\\nMeeMee,\\nCongratulations on improvement in your bone density. You are very fortunate that you don\\'t have any side effects from the Fosamax. Just about everyone I have talked with and including myself gets terrible stomach problems from the medication.\\n\\nI\\'m 54 and my T-score was -3.5 in spine (L2-L4 region) and -2.4 in the hip.  My gynecologist told me the spine score was really bad and sent me to an endocrinologist.  That\\'s why I went right on Forteo -- to try to get some more bone density before hopefully locking it in with Fosamax.\\n\\nIt was a real shock to get this diagnosis because I feel fine and have had no fractures.  My doctor also recommended working with a trainer at the gym to build upper body strength.  I\\'m doing that too.  The doctor said when muscle pulls on bone, it builds bone.  My trainer said muscle is heavy and when it lays on the bone, it builds bone.  Whatever.  I\\'m doing some light weight lifting and stretching exercises.  Trying to gradually become stronger.  Also working on balance since it\\'s important not to fall.  Good luck to everyone.\\nI\\'m 54 and my spine is -1.94 and my hips are -2.91. My numbers have actually gotten worse despite being on once a week Fosamax, increased calcium and increased exercise.  At my last dr\\'s appointment I told her I was going off Fosamax because a) it wasn\\'t working and b) I was getting severe muscle pains in my legs and feet. So, I\\'ve upped my weight bearing exercise - I lift weights three times a week now for half an hour or forty-five minutes, but I don\\'t know what else TO do, because I was doing everything right in the beginning anyway.\\n\\nOn another site I read that Fosamax might only \\'seem\\' to be working at times, because it builds \\'brittle bone mass\\' rather than regular bone mass. Does anyone know anything about this? What is brittle bone mass? (That doesn\\'t sound good.)\\n\\nLinni\\n\\nI\\'ve also read that. In order to understand, you must know a little about bone resorption and the mechanism Fosamax uses to build bone density. I made up a very simplified metaphor for it. Imagine your bones are like a busy parking lot. There\\'s a demolition crew (Osteoclasts) that comes in and removes old cracked asphalt, and another crew (Osteoblasts) that brings new asphalt in and fills up the holes. A truck comes and hauls away the stuff they removed, and that is called resorption. When you\\'re young, there\\'s a balance of these two crews, but as you get older, there are more osteoclasts removing the old cracked up asphalt than there are osteoblasts coming in to fill up the holes. So there are a lot holes not getting filled in. Enter Fosamax. It lays off a bunch of the osteoclasts so their activity slows down in order for the osteoblasts to catch up. You end up with a lot of areas of old asphalt that normally would have been removed, but at least the holes are gone.\\n\\nIf my metaphor isn\\'t accurate, I hope someone will correct me, because I am basing my own treatment decisions on it.\\nSo I have my husband\\'s reports here which I\\'m putting into a spreadsheet to track his results on Fosamax. The earliest scan was done on a different machine from the latest one, so I thought it would make more sense to compare the actual density rather than the T-scores, since different manufacturers have different standards. In 2000 his L1-L4 spine was .716. Then last week, his L1-L4 was .838. Sounds a lot better than 5 years ago, right? Here\\'s the kicker: in 2000 his T-score was -3.1. Now it\\'s -3.2. So it\\'s actually worse? Or should I even be looking at that number at all? How is a person supposed to base treatment decisions on data that is so conflicting?\\n\\nI guess this is really a rhetorical question. Thanks for letting me vent.',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hey there, I saw in another post you mentioned the parathyroids.  My mother in  law has a nodule on one of her parathryoids and is so sick with hyper/hypo symptoms it is unreal.  Her dr seems to know nothing and messes her up even more.  She is not proactive in her health because she is a \"naturalist\" and doesn\\'t believe in meds.  Can these nodules cause the same problems that our thryoid nodules do?\\n\\nThanks for your help, I hadn\\'t seen this issue on here before!\\n\\nKaren\\n\\nKant,\\n\\nSome people don\\'t know that a person has 4 parathyroid glands.  2 of them are IN the top lobes of your thyroid and 2 that are on the bottom outside of your thyroid.  It is possible to have nodules on a parathyroid gland, but I\\'m not sure of the incidence of those.  If  your mother in law is a naturalist, then she wouldn\\'t mind taking calcium pills as a supplement.  However, it is really important to see and endocrinologist for testing.   If the nodule is IN her thyroid but on a parathyroid gland she may encounter low calcium levels.   Thyroid nodules, a lot of times, don\\'t cause any problems, as was in my case until 7 yrs later I grew a bunch of new ones and my thyroid was totally out of control.  I had the hyper swing in December and I was told because Hashi\\'s will do this because of the attacks your thyroid is put through and releasing hormones from the dying thyroid tissue.  My surgeon told me that nodules are formed as a result of a response to attacks and build a protective lining around good tissue.  Some of these nodules produce their own hormones as well and that can cause excess hormones to be released.\\n\\nI would definitely try to convince her that seeing an endocrinologist is the best thing for her.  She needs to be checked out.  I am confused as to why some people refuse treatment for things that are beyond vitamin/herbal remedy.  I can see why one would go to a naturopath to try to remedy something naturally, but when it\\'s something that is more serious, a physician/endo is who you should seek treatment from.  I don\\'t think a diabetic would try only herbal/vitamins to control their insulin levels...\\n\\nGood luck with your MIL and tell her how important her health is not only to her, but your family\\n\\nThe parathyroids are totally separate (functionally speaking, not location-wise) from the thyroid, and parathyroid adenomas can cause a whole bunch of their own problems.  Parathyroid adenomas cause hyperparathyroidism, which leads to EXCESS calcium.  (Hypoparathyroidism is almost nonexistant except in cases where the parathyroids have been surgically removed.)  So I\\'d say, she shouldn\\'t go taking lots of calcium supplements before she knows what the problem is!  If it\\'s hyperparathyroidism, she could make things worse that way.  Symptoms of hyperparathyroidism can be pretty vague and many of them overlap with thyroid symtpoms.  Has she had her calcium and parathyroid hormone levels measured?\\n\\nHope you don\\'t mind me butting into this thread...\\nI have to disagree with the statement that hypoparathyroidism is almost non existent reasons other than surgical removal or damage.  Yes, this is one of the main occurrences but not the sole cause.  I have been to the hypoparathyroidism website and I\\'m pretty sure the people that were born without parathyroid glands can tell you they exist with this problem.  The problem isn\\'t as well known as it should be.   People who have kidney transplants experience problems with their parathyroids catching up with the hormones, and I\\'ve read of a poor guy who had a kidney transplant and then the parathyroids wouldn\\'t work right and they were awaiting parathyroid transplants (from neck to arms) afterwards.\\n\\nkant, your mother in law really needs testing, that\\'s where treatment begins.  If she is constantly feeling ill, then she isn\\'t helping herself by not correcting the situation with real medications/treatment.\\n\\nI agree that if your calcium levels are too high, then there are more serious problems and it\\'s best to get this checked out...try to convince her.  If they know of a nodule on the parathyroid gland, then she needs to act upon that diagnosis, and it needs to be someone experienced...an endo.\\n\\nNot trying to be a grunch, just trying to help out a bit\\n\\nHave a great weekend\\n\\nHey, I appreciate you both!\\n\\nShe was actually diagnosed with this nodule of the parathryoid gland 5 years ago.  The thing is she is real \"flakey\".    I mean a good person but a real free spirit of sorts and doesn\\'t do meds.  She had been very sick and goes to this herbalogist <sp>?\\n\\nShe did get a biopsy of this ( I am not sure how ) and it was benign but she never followed up.  She has ALL the same symptoms I do and I have hashi\\'s and 2 nodules, only I am going to several real dr\\'s.  In fact I am having a TT on Tuesday due to these nodules and the hashi\\'s even though my thyroid functions normally.\\n\\nI appreciate all of your advice I had not seen the topic here.  I will look up the parathyroid website you mention.  I know she won\\'t listen but at least I will know.\\n\\nI can\\'t either figure out why someone disregards their health over a view of meds that is misguided.  She is flakey all around so it fits in!\\nGod love her!   She is only 51 and I hate to see her so sick!    Now that she sees me not only taking thyroid meds but taking the action of getting this thing out of me which I fought tooth and nail for to get into specialists in town, she is starting to look at things like maybe she is being stupid with her health.\\n\\nI will keep encouraging her but first I must get myself together\\n\\n\\nThanks again!\\n\\nKaren\\n',\n",

       " {'post': 'The news was out yesterday on 5 years of Protelos (strontium ranelate). Its not a hormone like Forteo and Preos. It doesn\\'t just slow bone death like the bisphosphonates nor does it just increase bone formation like the parathryoid hormone drugs. Protelos both increases bone formation and decreases bone resorption. And it\\'s the first and only anti-osteoporotic treatment to show five-year, evidence-based efficacy against both vertebral and non-vertebral fractures. It was approved in Europe in September 2004.\\n\\nThe Phase III clinical trials were called SOTI (Spinal Osteoporosis Therapeutic Intervention, involving 1649 women) and TROPOS (Treatment Of Peripheral Osteoporosis, involving 5091 women) just in case you want to search for the results yourself. All women received calcium and vitamin D supplements during the trials. Signifcant improvement was seen after only 1 year of treatment. Measurement of bone density was done every six months and vertebral xrays annually during the trials.\\n\\nSome antibiotics are not compatible with Protelos, it shouldn\\'t be used in those w/severe kidney disease and the drug was associated with blood clotting during the trials. Unfortunately, it is a powder mixed with water recommended to be drunk two hours after a mean. (I\\'d much prefer a pill!)\\n\\nI did find one letter criticizing the trials for including little information on the adverse effects of strontium. Some points of criticism were:\\n\\n1] Strontium caused a 50% increase in the risk of venous thromboembolism (including pulmonary embolism).\\n2] Strontium also increased serum creatine kinase activity in 30% of patients.\\n3] Neurological and muscular adverse effects were inadequately documented, although disorders of this type were observed in animals.\\n4] Data from experimental studies and dialysis patients with renal failure raise the possibility of these adverse effects.\\n5] There is not enough evidence of clinical advantages over diphosphonates.\\n\\nThe use of the term \"disphosphonates\" confused me. Did they mean \"bisphosphonates\"?\\n\\nMy question is: will Protelos be trialed in the US for possible approval AND will there be stringent oversight of the reporting of adverse events during those trials. Because, frankly, Protelos sounds interesting, exciting and promising. But keeping in mind Merck\\'s current problems over under reporting adverse cardiac events w/Vioxx ....\\n\"My question is: will Protelos be trialed in the US for possible approval AND will there be stringent oversight of the reporting of adverse events during those trials.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s the million dollar question.  Drug companies employ countless strategies to mislead the public and the FDA about the negatives of their drugs and it\\'s all perfectly legal.  Here\\'s just one (I\\'ve talked about it before):  They begin with a group of test subjects, give them the drug for a short period of time and up to 2/3 of the group, who have any number of adverse reactions, can be dropped from the study. They\\'re called \"losers\" in the industry.  Depending on the drug, number of problems, etc., they repeat this process any number of times until they\\'re satisfied that those who remain, will, at least initially, have a positive experience on the drug.  The premareting trials then begin.  Does that sound to you, like the results of the study would reflect how the general population would react to a drug? Certainly not and that\\'s just ONE of the underhanded, irresponsible things a drug company can do to get their drugs approved.  Skilled writers and no back-up testing by the FDA, can also help tremendously in getting drugs approved, that possibly shouldn\\'t be.\\nSpin,\\n\\nThanks for more detailed info. about how drug companies operate! I knew they were lax to report side-effects but didn\\'t know\\nhow they went about choosing subjects and such for the trials. This is such a serious problem because so many people have bought into the medical model of treating with these toxic drugs.\\n\\nI know there are many who post here who rely on these drugs. I don\\'t fault them for their choice, because it IS their choice. I look to the drug companies for perpetuating deception in the name of greed.\\n\\nA bit of an aside, but not really. I don\\'t know if anyone saw the segment on 60 minutes last night. It was about global warming and how the scientists who are trying to warn us about this very real problem, and how it is\\nhaving effects on our planet, are being censored and silenced by our administration. It reminded me of the book/movie Farenheit 455 (I may have the number wrong.)\\nThanks for the info on this, CrohnieToo. I looked at Servier\\'s site. It does say the patients who dropped out of the study did so because of nausea. I\\'m trying to make sense of the numbers regarding the venous thromboembolism...It looks like 0.7% or 7 out of 1000 had it, which was about 42% greater than those on placebo, so I guess that the normal risk for VTE is about 4-5 people out of 1000, according to their study. Hence their recommendation that people at risk for VTE not take the drug. Of course, it may be years before we in the USA see it, so by then there should be a lot more post-marketing data available.\\n\\nMy rant on the FDA:\\nThere was a time when the FDA was accused of being too slow to approve new drugs and was depriving patients of drugs that might be beneficial for them. Due to these complaints, Congress passed a new law in 1992 allowing the FDA to make its drug approval process much faster.\\n\\nHaving the drug companies conduct their own studies is indeed problematic, but I\\'m not sure that we should have the FDA conduct them either. Think of the HUGE bureaucracy it would require to test all the drugs in the pipeline. And considering their past performance, I\\'m not sure I\\'d be willing, as a taxpayer, to finance it. Perhaps an independent company should do all clinical trials? I wonder if that\\'s at all feasible, because who would pay for it? That company could also be required to follow up on post-marketing adverse events and report them to the FDA which I agree is the most serious defect in the current scheme of things.\\n\\nBy the way, I looked it up and it seems that diphosphonate is just another way of saying biphosphonate,\\nand\\nboth being root words for \"two\".\\n\\nAleta145\\n__________________\\nDx 5/04, age 49: Spine -3.0, Hip: -1.9\\n5/05: Spine -2.7, Hip -2.1\\nCurrent treatment: Evista',\n",

       " {'post': 'Osteoporosis and hyperparathyroid disease\\nDoes anybody out there suffer from osteoporosis caused by hyperparathyroid (NOT thyroid!!) disease? If so, I would love to hear from you.\\nI am 55 years old . About 5 years ago, I started feeling tired, lacked energy and started to find life a real struggle. My doctor dismissed this as a ‘time of your life problem’ and offered very little help. My health deteriorated over several years and further severe symptoms appeared (anxiety, muscle weakness, joint pain, bone pain, stiffness, etc.). Eventually, 1½ years ago, I was diagnosed as having primary hyperparathyroid disease (pHPT). One of the four, tiny parathyroid glands in my neck had become overactive. By then, my quality of life was very poor. I could only move with difficulty and pain, I couldn’t sleep, I had psychological problems……..Then I found that I had severe osteoporosis. All these symptoms were caused by pHPT.\\nAbout a year ago, I had a successful operation to remove the overactive gland. My symptoms slowly started to improve. But, 6 months after the operation, my consultant put me on Fosamax to increase my bone density. This was a disaster for me because the Fosamax reversed the improvement in my symptoms. After 6 months on Fosamax, I was almost back to square one with considerable pain and stiffness. 3 months ago, I stopped the Fosamax. I am once again improving except that I have recently had an eye problem. Fortunately, I found the messages about Fosamax and eye problems on the old HealthBoard osteoporosis message board. These were very helpful and informative for me.\\nSo, is anybody out there with similar problems to mine??\\n\\nMy problem is I developed hyperparathyroidism and after many months of being sick and being told it was just due to depression I literally begged to have have some lab work done because I new it was different than past depressive symtoms. I was diagnosised with hyperpathyroidism and had the surgery. However, after the surgery my parathyroid hormone level never returned to normal and started going back up. I think the last was 158 with 65 being high normal. However, my calcium levels returned to normal. I still don\\'t feel well, but was reminded rather rudely that I had mood disorder before the endocrine problem and was referred back to my psychiatrist. I don\\'t know if all of this is in my head or what, but I still have the left hip pain, nausea ,sleep disturbances, mood irritability and try to pretend I\\'m fine. It may all be stress related who knows. I was just wondering if anyone else out there has experienced this type of problem after their parathyroidectomy. I just want to feel well again and am concerned that the elevated PTH level could be causing stress on my body. I made an appointment to see a rheumatologist, but I still have a month before he can see me. Any response would be helpful. Thanks. Shadow 50\\nI\\'d like to keep this topic going.  I am 5 days post parathyroidectomy for an ectopic parathryroid adenoma (anterior mediastinum) which was successfully removed with a minimally invasive approach (thorascope).  I don\\'t know what to expect in terms of recovery. My pre-op symptoms were vague, though I\\'m inclined to believe not unusual for hyperparathyroidism. Probably over the last 5 yrs, I\\'ve noticed marked tenderness in my hips, at the crease of  my thigh/groin and the bones and muscles of my feet.  I\\'d often think, I feel like I have the flu.  I have not had kidney stones.  I have osteopenia (bone density scan).  I spent a year deciding to have the surgery (cure) vs. lifetime monitoring.  According to my surgeons (endocrine and thoracic), the surgery went extremely well.  The PTH dropped and the calcium stabilized.  I left the hospital with a small pneumothorax (collapsed lung), which I\\'m told will resolve on its own.  I\\'m not particularly sore at the chest tube site.  I feel like getting out and about, however, I do bottom out mid-afternoon.  Then all my tender spots seem more tender than ever.  Needless to say, I still harbor reservations about whether there isn\\'t something else at work in my body.  I realize it\\'s much too soon to judge, but I sure am interested (like you) to hear anything about hyperparathyroidism, since there doesn\\'t seem to be much out there.  I am grateful no one suggested Fosamax.  That sounds like a nightmare.  If my \"symptoms\" resolve, then I may be a person others can draw support from.  So, I\\'m just getting this out there, because it does make me feel a little loopy in the head, because when I feel lousy, I tend to beat up on myself.  The mind chatter is\\nSo for now, I feel hopeful.\\nHello, I am very interested in asking phu13, was your parathyroid adenoma located prior to surgery and if so how?  I have elevated PTH, normal calcium levels, severe kidney stones that have gone on so long that I now have signs of renal failure as well as often feeling fluish, trouble sleeping and irritability.  I am being sent far from my home to see an endocrine surgeon who is supposedly the best but I am still being told that I have to have a \"neck exploration surgery\" (10\" incision!!) because my adenoma was not located via sestamibi scan or ultrasound.  I would really rather have the gland located prior to the surgery so I can have a mini surgery.  Any info anyone has in regards to this would be so much appreciated as I am quite frightened about someone digging around in my neck!  Thanks!\\nShadow I haven\\'t had my surgery yet but wish you luck and let us know what your rheumatologist finds. Thanks Lily 54\\nspitvit,\\nThey haven\\'t found my  adenoma yet either and suggested a neck exploration surgery so i found a new surgeon that does the minimally invasive surg.  I also have thyroid nodules that have to be retested and another sestimibi scan.  Does anyone with this illness have vitamin d deficiency?\\nHi,\\nDid anyone here visited the website [url]www.parathyroid.com[/url] or have experiences having minimally invasive parathyroid surgery with Dr.Norman in Florida. According to his website, he seems to be the pioneer in this procedure.\\n\\nI have recently been diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism and after some research on the disease I decided to go for the minimal invasive surgery procedure. I live in California, but I have scheduled a surgery beginning of June with Dr.Norman in florida. I would really appreciate if I could get any feedback on this or anyone who has experience in the MIRP procedure and their experiences.\\n\\n-Jay\\nBoy, I\\'d be leery of having parathyroid surgery too if they couldn\\'t locate an adenoma! Have you guys really poured over your blood draw results and urine tests and thoroughly discussed and questioned them with your endocrinologists?\\n\\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism can be caused by malabsorption problems and/or by renal problems. Vitamin D deficiency that we are reading so much about now can cause secondary hyperparathyroidism.\\n\\nI hope that you are all able to work this out and get some relief whether thru surgery or whatever. Good luck and God bless!!!\\nI have just been diagnosed with hyperparathyroid. I was going to wait for a second opinion because they did not locate the gland on the scan, but my BP has shot up from it\\'s usual 105/65 to 170/100! I think i am going to pop! Started bP medicine today because i didn\\'t think i should wait on that. How can you go from low BP for 56 years, then pop! I am considering a second opinion with a doctor Kokura who my friend had do an op a year ago or Dr. Norman in Tampa. ANyone have any feedback?\\nI recently had my endocrinologist test my parathyroid hormone levels because of kidney stones in the past and now again in the present.\\n\\nMy PTH level was 76 w/ normal being (10 - 65) pg/mL\\nMy calcium level was 9.1 w/ normal being (8.8 - 10.1) mg/dL\\n\\nDoes this mean Hyperparathyroidism?\\n\\nTsmur\\nI\\'m not sure that anyone but your doctors could answer that. Tests for hyperparathyroidism \"usually\" include low serum calcium rather than high normal. Other results could be abnormal serum phosphorus levels, either high or low; elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, variable vitamin D levels (both 25 D OH and 25 D1 OH) and/or abnormal urine calcium levels, either high or low. I\\'ve forgotten the physical symptoms other than bone and joint pain. I would think an internet search on hyperparathyroidism should bring those up. Good luck and God bless.\\nI\\'m going for a second opinion next week. I have elevated calcium, elevated ionized calcium and elevated parathyroid hormone levels. The scan did not locate the malfunctioning gland, so I\\'m not sure than an op is the way to go, but i\\'m trying to be proactive, though all i want to do is crawl under a rock and have it all go away.\\nHa! Since my last parathyroid blood draw was drawn at my Endo\\'s office and sent to Quest Labs for testing I think I know why she prefers I have my draws done at a Quest Lab! Quest pretty much does the Dx\\'ing for her!!!\\n\\nThe Quest Lab report not only gives the test levels but also an \"Interpretive Guide\" which gives the Intact PTH in relation to Calcium.\\n\\nThe normal PTH lab reference ranges are 10 - 65 pg/ml, the Calcium reference ranges may vary from lab to lab.\\n\\nSo PTH intact level <20 and low calcium level would indicate Hypoparathyroidism.\\nPTH intact level >65 and high calcium level would indicate Primary hyperparathyroidism.\\nPTH intact level >65 and normal or low calcium level would indicate Secondary hyperparathyroidism and\\nPTH intact level <20 with high calcium level would indicate Non-parathyroid hypercalcemia\\nI\\'ve been suffering with hyperparathroidism since 2001. I had surgery Nov 2001, and had three and one half of the parathyroids removed. I\\'m still battling this conditon, with my boold calcium levels yo, yoing up and down all the time. I have chronic pain in the right flank, chronic fatigue, and bone pain. I now have kidney stones, my first that I\\'m aware of having. The Dr said it was small enough, it should pass on it\\'s own. That was last week, and still not passed. Now I\\'m going for more tests to see if it is caught. I\\'m also having problems starting with the gallblader, not sure yet if this is realted to the hyperparathyroidism. I feel for anyone who is experciencing this condition. Surgery was supposed to cure me, but unfortunately it didn\\'t. Has anyone else had the surgery, and not been cured?\\n\\nBecca\\nI recently had a hyperparathyroid removed on April 25th.  I had my surgery performed in Northern Virginia by a doctor who was recommended to me by serveral people.  It seems there must surgeons who are more than capable of performing this type of surgery.  This type of operations has been around for a few years now so there are many doctors who have experience.\\n\\nUnlike the doctor in Florida, my doctor does not recommend that this surgery be performed under a local anesthia.  Since the patient is still awake there is a possibility that the patient may move.  This can have harmful results as you may have read from an earlier post. My surgery was done on an outpatient basis.  My surgery was performed under general anesthsia.  The surgery took a little over an hour. One reason why it took longer than what Dr. Norman would say it should take is that my doctor took several blood samples before, during, and after the surgery.  These blood samples were taken to monitor my PTH levels.  My PTH level was as high as 153 prior and after the surgery it was down to 65.  Tissue was also taken to verify by a second source that the parathyroid removed was an adenoma.\\n\\nI was out of the hospital by 3:30 p.m., driven home by my wife.\\n\\nUnless you really want to go to Florida I recommend for you to find a local surgeon that has performed this type of operation and comes highly recommended.   If you have any complications or issues on the operation you will not have to go back to Florida.\\n\\nGood luck on your operation!!\\n',\n",

I tell people that I dont want to becusae \"I DO\" stay in remission for long periods and why start screwing around if its not broken yet?\\n\\nHas anyone been Grave\\'s and eventually became hypo and had to do synthroid?\\n\\nAny information would be helpfull thank you all, i really am enjoying reading on this site it is very informative.\\nHello, I have Graves diagnosed 2002, stayed on PTU for 2 years. Feb.2004 took RAI and went hypo 5 months after.\\n\\nTo be truthful, I should have stayed on the PTU because the RAI messed up my eyes for awhile. It caused an increase in thyroid hormones as the thyroid started dying off, which caused very rapid heartbeat. So, that was quite scary. I did take the RAI while being quite hyper, because you have to stop PTU for 2 weeks before RAI.\\n\\nThere are some people that do not have any problems, and others do. It\\'s just a matter of a continuation of trying to find just the right amount of thyroid replacment to make you feel good.\\n\\nI can honestly tell you that my life has definitely not been the same since RAI.\\nI recall a poster \"Imoutrunning\" who had Graves and her thyroid fizzled out and she became hypo. Haven\\'t seen a post recently though.\\nIf you have RAI your thyroid eventually dies\\ndoctors say it\\'s easier to control that way...they should read this board, every hypo question concerns meds,and how they feel awful\\n\\nMy sister was diagnosed with Grave and took PTU eventually she was told her thyroid had \"died\" and she\\'s been on thyroxine replacement ever since.\\nS\\nI just found out today that I\\'ve gone hypo after being on Methimazole for Graves for the past 2 months. Apparently my dosage was too high. But, you know, I feel like crap! I thought I was having hyper symptoms (hot, can\\'t sleep, faster heartbeat, anxious, restless) the past couple of days, but I got a call today saying my TSH is 3.06 and should be closer to 1. So they\\'re decreasing my dose even more. I honestly don\\'t know what to think with this crazy disease. It is soooooooooooo frustrating. The only hypo symptoms I\\'ve been feeling lately have been depression, fatigue(but I always have that no matter what), and anger. But who knows... Those could be caused by other things or it\\'s just me. I don\\'t know. I\\'m exasperated trying to figure out how to make my thyroid happy. I wish you and everyone else here much luck!!!\\n\\n\\n\\nBothered I dont understand?  The range for TSH is 0.3-4.5 and in some places i think it\\'s 0.3-5.5.  If you are TSH 3.06 why would they say you were hypo?  That doesnt make sense to me at all.  Unless they have other tests that show it.  My Grave\\'s disease tends to keep my tsh just barely in range.  Like now it\\'s at 0.7 and 2months ago it was 0.6.  When i was pregnant it was around 1.6 and i think it went to 3.0 a few years ago.  I wish it would stay in that range though, i dont like being on the lower end.\\n\\nI am not willing to give up my thyroid just yet.  Thank you all for the info, i wont do the RAI since my thyroid is being good and goes into remission on its own and stays there for long periods of time.\\n\\nBothered I would also look into other problems that might be causing other ailments.  I have fatigue(also have 4 kids no question about that there lol), but i also get headaches and my head and face feel like it\\'s going ot explode and thus i feel depressed(more like upset) cuz my head hurts and i know it\\'s due to allergies.  I have cold hands and feet and always have my entire life, so have my sister,my mother and all of mykids and sisters kids.  It is just hereditary.  When my thyroid acts up I do get hot too fast but i know that my symptoms stem from other stuff so i try to see what they are.  LIke my allergies cause me to have fatigue and I swore up and down that i didnt have allergies.  I WAS wrong lol.  Just make sure you are getting the right treatment.\\nmama, thanks for the info. i really am questioning what is going on. i may have to get a 2nd opinion. (i also have cold feet all the time!)\\nI had graves disease back about 16 years ago.  I was put on PTU for a few weeks to stabilize me and then given the radioactive iodine.  After about nine months they gave me another dose of the radioactive iodine.  My bloodwork still kept showing hyperthyroid but my body was screaming for help.....\\nI was finally put on synthroid and since the iodine treatments even on the synthroid I have managed to gain 85 pounds.  It does not matter what I do eat or not eat I can gain but not loose....I would not reccomend this treatment and if I could do this over I would have gone for surgery.  I have also since had to have parathryoid surgery as they say the radioactive iodine caused a parathyroid to go hyper....I wish you the best of luck and if you can avoid treatment do so as long as possible.......',\n",

Usually, the first day he starts to feel dizzy and very tired (almost cold-like symptoms)his head gets cloudy and he gets very disoriented. Then on the second day he is so tired that he cannot get out of bed. His mind is running miles a minute and every time he closes his eyes, his eyes twitch and he cannot relax. He cannot sleep for about 24 hours. He gets chills so bad that he cannot control them and bundles with 4-5 blankets, then the chills turn to hot flashes.  The next day he cannot move, pure exhaustion. He is pale and has no appetite. He is so weak that it hurts him to breathe or talk. This contuinues for a few days then he starts to feel slightly better and by the 6th day it is gone like it never happened. This experience follows the exact sequence every time.

Early stages of malaria may resemble the onset of the flu. Travelers who become ill with a fever during or after travel in a malarious area should seek prompt medical attention and should inform their physician of their recent travel history.',\n",

And my flu has seemed to be rather light... however it just seems to persist even though I am getting enough sleep. Could anyone tell me could this be a symptom of something other than a small case of the flu?\\nHi Jae16.  Flu-like symptoms in the summer are a big tip-off to the possibility of Lyme disease.  Lyme disease is a muli-system bacterial infection caused from the bite of an infected tick.  Lyme disease is the second fastest growing infectious disease in the US after AIDS and the number one vector-borne disease in the US.  It is in every state.\\n\\nIf this is a possibility, it is very important to see a knowledgeable doctor.  No test is completely reliable, and results can vary by lab.  Many people test negative early in the infection.\\nCould it be anything else... I dont have a head ache or anything else listed there... Just the flu feeling...\\nIt could be many things such as Lyme disease or mono.  You really need to see a doctor.\\n\\nI hope you feel better soon.\\ncould it just be the flu?\\nWhat\\'s your temperature? Do you have body aches, sweats? Any abdominal pain?  There are many conditions that can cause flu like symptons. Kidney infection, pancreatitis, the common cold etc.\\nIf you have flu like symptoms even with a mild fever and it\\'s persistent, you should have it evaluated by a doctor.\\n\\nMaC\\nNo there is absolutely no temperature... Its just kind of like that feeling you get the first day your starting to get the flu where you feel kind of woozy... However mine is really light and it just seams to be hanging around. I have no head aches... no sweating just feeling a little ill for 2 weeks now.\\nWell, it doesn\\'t sound serious and it seems very mild.  Sometimes flu like symptons can last a few weeks. It is probably nothing to worry about. If I were you I would just try to stay healthy.  Drink plenty of fluids, take a daily multivitamin if you wish. Since there is no fever then it doesn\\'t seem the body is fighting off anything. Maybe it could be something in your diet that is making you feel that way.\\nHope you feel better soon.\\n\\nMaC\\nThankyou that is also what I have been hoping... It has been about two weeks now and I have had no fever... just the kind of head sick feeling you get when you get the flu. Could these symptoms be as a result of something serious like leukemia? (not to be a hypocondriac ?sp?) Should I get a blood test? thanks guys\\nSure, anytime something is going on with your body that causes you concern you should see your doctor.  Leukemia can go unoticed for years. But along with\\nmalaise, (vague feeling of bodily discomfort) some other symptoms of leukemia are: abnormal bleeding, excessive bruising, weakness, weight loss, bone or joint pain, infection and fever, abdominal pain (fullness), fatigue.  Leukemia can be identified through a blood test.  If your \"woozyness\" doesn\\'t subside an a reasonable amount of time, I would consult a doctor.\\n\\nMaC\\nI also thought of something else. Do you have sinus problems? Or, ever had sinus problems?  Also, can you describe what you feel? More than just \"head sick feeling\". That can mean dizzy, light headed, unable to concentrate, feeling clogged up, etc. Woozy? Do you exercise at all? Did you have a cold or anything before this?\\n\\nMaC\\nWell I am still feeling sick... Its a very hard feeling to explain... its kind of like the way you feel the first day you get the flu, just achy kind of and a little woozy when I do activiity.

Is there anything else it could possibly be if my blod test is normal?\\nbump........\\nwell if you got a blood test , did you see the doctor to get it? or did you just go into a clinic and ask to get a blood test? if you got a blood test, id say make sure you go see the doc hon if youre really worried. that would really be the best advice. since feeling fluish can fall into alot of different categories of illnesses, that would be the best thing to do and it will ease your worries as well. the worst thing is the added stress when youre sick sweetie.\\nJen\\nps please keep us posted! and i hope you feel better soon\\nyes i did get my blood test done at the docs and he said it all looked normal... so is there anything else to worry about?>',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hello everyone.\\n\\nI need some help.  I\\'ve been having a plethora of symptoms for over two months now, and have researched and researched along with tests from my doctors and still can\\'t figure anything out.\\n\\nIt all started about two months ago.  I had some pretty bad abdominal pain...but didn\\'t think much of it.  I figured maybe I had picked up a bug or something.  Later that day I had a bowel movement...which was pretty much bloody diarrhea.  I had to wear a panty liner because it continued to bleed throughout the day and that night.\\n\\nA week passed and there wasn\\'t a lot more bleeding.  There was a little blood here and there in my stools, but nothing anything like that first bout.  As another week passed, the abdominal pain became much worse and I started to carry a low fever (around 99.5 degrees F).  I also began to feel nauseous and tired, and generally weak.  I began feeling so weak that my heart would feel like it would beat out of my chest just from going up some stairs (that I go up every day).\\n\\nThese symptoms continued and the abdominal pain continued to worsen and worsen.  I\\'ve now got a severe pain in my entire left side...with the worst being around the middle of my left side, and another really tender spot under my left ribs.  The spot under my left ribs seems almost like something is swollen there.  I have to constantly lean to my right because it feels like it is pushing out on my ribs and if I bend onto it it kinda pinches.\\n\\nI\\'ve also had some pretty bad pain in my back whenever the abdominal pain is at its worst.  I\\'m not sure if that is simply from the pain radiating or something else entirely.\\n\\nI\\'ve been tested for over 100 food allergies (all came back negative), and have watched what I ate, with no findings of worsening symptoms after eating anything.  I had a rectal exam which found a few hemorroids (which wasn\\'t bothering me anyway).  The doctor treated those, cleared them up..and still having all these symptoms.  I just had a colonoscopy and nothing was found...completely negative for any colon disorders.\\n\\nI did have a strange bout of a viral infection in July (somewhere are there).  They never figured out what it was, but I had about 20 swollen lymph nodes, with one being the size of a ping pong ball.  I have no idea if this could be related, but thought I\\'d add it just in case.\\n\\nI\\'ve researched and researched and am still stumped.  Is there any advice?  I could really use some help\\n\\nThanks,\\nVers\\nVers,\\n\\nYou\\'ve posted about these kinds of symptoms before.  Among your tests, have you had blood tests?  CT scans?  MRIs?  Have they looked for hernias or any type of gastric problem like an ulcer?\\n\\nAlso, I see that you have posted on a dozen or so different boards, and I wonder if any of your problems can be stress related?\\n\\nOf course you know we can\\'t help you with a diagnosis -- we can only help you research when you have a diagnosis or test results for which you need resources.\\n\\nMy only recommendation to you from here is to get ahold of the test results you DO have, and see if you can look up some of the terminology you\\'ll find in those tests.\\njust a thought, but have they checked your liver and pancreas?  sometimes you can have referred pain to your left side.   What about your right side?  any problems there?  What about your heart, alot of women experience abdominal pain when they r having heart problems. That wouldn\\'t explain the fullness feeling. But just a thougt. Did they check to see if the blood in your stool was from the hemarrhoids or actually in the stool?  I am just trying to throw out ideas.  Hope you get to feeling better!!! keep us posted.\\n\\nj\\nnpainnfla,\\n\\nNo, they haven\\'t checked for liver or pancreas yet, but from my research, I\\'m going to talk to them about it next time, as it does sound like it might be a qualifying idea.  There\\'s no pain in my right side, although last night I had experienced the absolute worst pain in my life under my ribs.  At first I figured it was gas because that can hurt there pretty bad, but mine is usually relieved when I lay down.  I laid down and still couldn\\'t relieve it.  I tossed and turned for two hours, moaning in pain..I know I probably should have went to the ER, but really didn\\'t care to.  It was finally relieved by me clutching a pillow tight against my abdomen with a heating pad against it for about a half hour.  Have no idea what happened...it came out of nowhere without eating, having a bowel movement, anything...just out of nowhere.\\n\\nAs for heart problems...I have no idea?  I\\'m only 20...although I\\'ve had many illnesses before my age (I know a lot of people rule things out by age, but I\\'ve went against odds many times).  I\\'ve already ruled out gallbladder because #1, the pain\\'s not on the right side, and #2, I don\\'t have a gallbladder anymore.\\n\\nI DO have hemorroids which possibly explain the blood in the stool, however don\\'t explain the persistent fever and sharp pains...along with the fatigue...etc.\\n\\nThanks for the suggestions and questions.  I think the next step will be looking at the liver and pancreas (may have damaged them from past drug abuse...\\n, but hopefully not).  I\\'ll also try to get a hold of my test results to put on here in hopes of figuring out some stuff...oh!  I do have a high sed. rate, which can mean inflamation?  I don\\'t know how that works tho.\\n\\nMisDiagnosisMOD,\\n\\nI know I post on here a lot, I love the communities and the support and answers I can find here.\\nI do take advantage of that, after all, that is what it\\'s here for, right?  I do have a lot of ongoing health problems, thus the posting on multiple boards.  I realize I am only 20 and that it seems strange to have so many problems, but I am getting assistance from professionals along with my personal research and have unfortunately found that I have seemed to get a lot of illness against statistics for my age.  There\\'s always that 1 or 2% tho.  As far as stress, I did consider that.  I do have stress problems, however those usually show up as achy all over (sometimes severe), GI upset, headaches, sometimes dizziness, etc.  This specific problem is more like sharp, shooting pain in a specific area, along with a fever, which I do not believe can be caused by stress (which my doctor agrees).\\n\\nI will however follow the rules and find my tests to get help, rather than throwing this stuff out in the air.  I\\'m just getting frustrated and can use all of the help I can find\\n.\\n\\nThanks again you two!\\n\\n-Vers\\nVersailles,  I know how you feel about being young and having so many problems.  I am in the same boat.  I will not go into all of it, as I have also posted about it many times before.  Everytime a doctors says \"theres no way, your too young.\"  It usually ends up being the case.  I mean I had hemorrhoid surgery when I was 5 years old.  So, I understand completely what you mean.  I wish I could be more help, with the pain.  You said you did have your gallbladder out right?  Does the pain go anywhere else?  like to your back, neck, shoulder blades?  One more thing I thought of, I don\\'t remember how long you said this has been going on, but could you be pregnant?  An Ectopic pregnancy could cause some, but not all of your symptoms.  Just throwing things out there.  Hope you have a better night tonight.\\n\\nj\\n\\n\\nYes, I had my gallbladder removed out a couple years ago.  The pain is mostly just under that left area under my rib.  it does shoot around into my back occasionally and down my left side, and it often shoots more into the middle of my ribs (more underneath the ribs, rather than like my sternum).  There is no pain in my shoulder blades or neck that I can think of tho.  There is no possibility of pregnancy.  I have not be sexually active in over a year, so that couldn\\'t be an option.\\n\\nThe thing that I find to be the strangest symptom of all is the feeling under my left rib.  It feels like something is shoved up under there, almost like a grapefruit has been shoved up under there or something.  Whenever I bend or twist, I can feel almost like something is rubbing against my ribs.  It doesn\\'t feel hard, but definitely a pressure and my abdomen looks a little swollen visually on that side.  I also noticed that by putting heat on the spot the other day, I had actually made it worse.. when I tried heat on it again, it made it worse.  When I put cold on it, it made it better.  Rather strange how that worked.\\n\\nAnyway thanks again, I\\'m hoping to get some more information soon to share, and hopefully figure this thing out.\\n\\nUnfortunately that extreme pain I felt the other night has recurred again a couple times, and things just continue to go downhill.  I have another doctor appt. again soon, and hopefully she\\'ll be able to run a couple more tests and maybe I\\'ll finally get an answer (hopefully a good one).\\n\\nThanks again, and it\\'s nice to know I\\'m not the only young person going through this medical stuff.  I feel a little comforted knowing I\\'m not alone in this.\\n\\n*hugs*\\n-Vers\\nUpdate:\\n\\nToday I have discovered some new things about what\\'s going on.  The severe pain I had the other day.  This time I noticed that it came on after I had stretched my back (stretching backwards and side to side).  The pain was severe, just like last time, but I tried to pay more attention to the details of it.  I noted that the pain was again all the way across my upper abdomen, just below my ribs, with the worst still being on the left side.  About every couple seconds, the pain would shoot in a straight line from the middle/upper abdomen down to my belly button, and up into the lower part of my chest a little.  The worst of the shooting pain is that which shoots down to my belly button though.  Another thing I noticed is that during these bouts, there is some very loud gut noises.  They are easily heard without having your ear anywhere near my abdomen.  I can also feel the movement/gurgling just below my ribs..and it does not move or gurgle anywhere else.\\n\\nThere was no eating or bowel movements directly before this bout..just stretching brought it on I think.  After it, I had no gas or bowel movements or other GI upset/action, just the gurgling noise/sensation.  The pain again continued for several hours.\\n\\n-Vers\\nSome more possibilities are that you have some problem with your kidneys or ovaries.  However, a major part of it could still be gas! I\\'ve had some severe gas attacks (in that past) that (several times) lasted for days until the gas finally came out!  Go out (or have someone go for you) and try some gas-x.  Also, try to eat only liquids for a few days and see if enough stool clears your intestines to get this gas out. (If it is in there)  Can you make yourself burp?  Sometimes this can get some of the gas out.\\nAre your lymph nodes still swollen?  I had swollen lymph nodes one time (in several regions) and that particular doctor seemed to be really worried at the time. Some possibilities of swollen lymph nodes (besides infections) are lymphoma, hodgkin\\'s disease. immunodeciciency and AID) Not saying that you have any of these.\\nIs it possible that your viral infection was mononucleosis? This seems like a bad flu in the early stages and the symptoms include fever, chills, headache,sore throat and a profound feeling of weakness.  You may also notice that you have painful swelling in your neck, armpits and/or groin (lymp nodes).  You may also develop jandice (turn yellow) or a skin rash.  Your spleen may enlarge (located in your upper left abdomen).  I had mono when I was in the 10th grade.  You don\\'t necessarily get it form just kissing although it is nick named \"the kissing disease\".  You can also get it from someone by sharing a drink with someone who has it.  The \"funny\" thing about mono is that it doesn\\'t seem to run in (large) epidemics.  Usually your body is under a lot of stress etc when you get it.  I did not get the yellowness (that I can remember) or the rash and my spleen did not seem to be enlarged but I did get a terrible sore throat. (Not everyone gets all of the same symptoms even for the same problem!)  I was told that once you get it you (\"normally) never get it again.\\nMarilyn,\\n\\nNo, it was not mono.  I was tested twice for mono and it came up negative both times.  The doctors finally just gave me a broad antibiotic that got rid of it.  I don\\'t believe I have immunodeficiency diseases, although I do have hypothyroidism (treated).  I have never been sexually active (no sexual acts at all), so I can rule out STDs.\\n\\nAs for the gas, I\\'ve tried gas medications like Gas-X and have recieved no relief.  I just had a colonoscopy recently (so I\\'ve been emptied out...trust me\\n).  Even if I burp or pass gas, there is no relief, at all.  I don\\'t believe it\\'s my kidneys or female stuff because there is gurgling in my stomach?  Pretty loud gurgling...and it doesn\\'t move.  It is on my upper left side and won\\'t move..usually gurgling will like move through my intestines, but this doesn\\'t.\\n\\nMy doctor is thinking about doing an endoscopy into my stomach and stuff to see if maybe I have a peptic ulcer or something, and then do some more bloodwork.  I hope to get this figured out soon!\\n\\nThanks for your responses,\\n-Vers\\nWhat you describe reminds me of when my gallbladder went bad. it took them forever to figure it out because i was only 18 at the time. hope you feel better soon.\\nHello Deeannek,\\n\\nThanks for your response; unfortunately, I don\\'t have a gallbladder anymore\\n.  I had it removed when I was 18 as well.  If I still had it, I would instantly assume that\\'s what it is...but unfortunately the options are running out.\\n\\nThanks again for the response.\\n\\n-Vers\\nHi Vers, you know that even though you\\'ve had your gall bladder removed, you can still make stones or have stones left behind in your bile ducts.\\nThis has happened to me.  My gastro did a procedure called an ERCP where they go into your bile ducts and cut a small opening to let the sludge and stones out.  Maybe you should look into that also.  One more thing, since I have a lot of stomach problems too, can it be pancreatitis?  I\\'ve also had that 4 times and the pain is just awful.  Most of the time the pain is located right in the middle of your gut.  Just 2 things that I thought you might want to check out.  Good luck.  Linda\\nHave your Dr\\'s checked you for Diverticulitis???  It causes pain on the left side, and can cause pain in the back.  Bloody stools too if it\\'s bad enough.  Fever, ect......\\n\\n\\nSid\\nLinda,\\n\\nThanks for the responses\\n.  I didn\\'t have stones previously in my gallbladder, it was a congenital defect where the opening wasn\\'t wide enough to empty out the bile and my gallbladder swelled up huge.  Could it still make stones even if I didn\\'t have any before?  I really don\\'t know myself.  How do they do the ERCP?  Is it an outpatient procedure?\\n\\nWhat all symptoms did you have with your pancreatitis?  I know the pain obviously, but what else?  Oh, and I\\'ve been having these problems for about two months now, so I don\\'t know how long pancreatitis can last?  I\\'m sorry, I know I\\'m asking a lot of questions.  I revisit my doctor on the 28th (he\\'s on vacation this week\\n).  So hopefully he can do some more tests to figure this out.\\n\\nStick,\\n\\nI\\'ve read about diverticulitis, but that is diagnosed through colonoscopy right?  I just had a colonoscopy and he didn\\'t find anything down there but a couple irritated hemmoroids, nothing else he said.  I\\'m really just trying to get a feel for possibilities so I can be prepared for whatever the diagnosis might me.\\n\\nThanks both of you.\\nHopefully I can get this figured out soon before I go crazy!\\n\\n\\n-Vers',\n",

       " {'post': 'good morning, my husband has been suffering from intense stomach burning since november, 2006. he has  had several tests done including ct scans, ecg, colonoscopy, xrays, tons of labwork and no doctor can detect what the problem is. the pcp thought it could be ibs or some sort of gastric disorder but no antacids seem to help his condition. he has been on pepcid, prilosec, protonix, nexium, nothing works. doc has referred him to a gi doc who has scheduled my husband for an eus (endoscopy ultrasound). they think it could be chronic pancreatitis. he has been referred to a pain mgt doc who has prescribed 5mg of oxycodone, taking two tabs every 6 hours as needed for pain. he originally had been prescribed methodone but pain mgt doc states the withdrawal from that is worse. my husband also has hep c but liver enzymes test appear to be normal. please tell me what you think or if you\\'ve had this same problem. thanks.\\nCan you let me know what they found. I have had stomach issues burning stomach pain in the center of my upper stomach and under my ribs to the right and left and radiating to the back. I have had endoscopy, colonoscopy, Ultrasounds, CT with contrast, HIDA scan, ful bloods 3 times, 2 ER visits, small bowel series, everything is normal. I was worried about chronic pancreatitis they keep saying no. Can you let me know what they found in your husband? Also does he have any other symptoms. I have pain everyday the Nexium has helped with the burning part but not the pain. I would appreciate any help.\\nThanks Sisty\\nHi Sisty, sorry to hear you are suffering as well. my husband had the procedure and no signs of chronic pancreatitis was there. in fact, the doc stated that every organ in his body was fine, that i would have to deal with the fact that he is a chronic pain sufferer. from there we went back to the pain mgt doc who prescribed ms contin which did absolutely nothing. he has since had his meds changed to the fentanyl patch, 25mg. the patch helps although he still has to use the 5mg of oxycodone as break through meds. he still can feel the stomach burning/gnawing but not as severe. we recently went to the pcp who has ordered more labs, hopefully results will be in tomorrow and we also have an appt scheduled with a johns hopkins g.i. doc n august. i know august, right!!! i am really considering holistic medicine but will seek acupuncture for some assistance. the conventional meds does not seem to be working and all this switching from this med to that med is becoming tiresome and costly. i am hoping that an alternative form of treatment will be the key. please let me know how you make out with your future tests. be blessed!\\nThank you for your reply. I too have had nothing resolved. I had a 2nd CT with contrast, full bloods and an MRI of the spine that showed 2 bulging discs and a torn disc. I am waiting on my next Dr\\' s appt. Let me know what happens at John Hopkins. My Dr also wants me to go to the Mayo Clinic? I am still concerned about chronic pancreatitis. It is good to hear your husband does not have it. Let me know if you get any resolution.\\nKeep well\\n\\n\\nI had this and finally had an endoscopy after all the other tests and many ER visits where they found \"nothing\" wrong. Turns out I have severe gastric erosions and ulcers in my stomach. This was causing the burning pain. I had no other ulcer symptoms. I hope this helps!\\nAlso, this is going to sound too simple.....Has he been checked for a hernia? When I first developed one, I had burning pain and soreness. This pain can be chronic for some people. Have him checked for hernias.\\nI have the stomach burning and pain in the mid section to the back. My doctor put me on Prevacid yesterday. I had an awful attack last night that lasted 3 hours. I was going to the E.R. but it was better before I made the decision. I was \\'wiped out\\' today. I\\'m hoping the Prevacid is the help I need since I just developed this a week ago. My diagnosis is Gastritis!\\nHi, my husband is still in pain but not as much providing he takes the pain meds prescribed by the pain management doctor. We went to an acupuncturist about two weeks ago who stated there isn\\'t anything wrong with any of my husband\\'s organs only that he is retaining some built of stress. He also gave him an herbal remedy. We still have the appointment in August with Hopkins but one of my doctors said he spoke to a colleague of his, who was a gastoenterologist and he also said that we may end up paying thousands and thousands of dollars in testing and procedures to find nothing... sounded like stress to him and this was before we went to the acupuncturist. Well, only time will tell if this is the cause. He has been checked for hernias as well  as ulcers, nothing. It has been very discouraging not knowing what is going on but at the same time its good to know all of his organs are okay.\\nI am sorry, but I would not take an acupuncturists word for it, that this is simply stress. You could miss something here if you just accept what people tell you. That can be dangerous. If it IS stress, you husband should get better by reducing stress in his life. Which is hard to do, by the way, when you have a undiagnosed illness. Is this stress greater than any he has ever experienced? Why now is he having these symptoms with stress? You can easily test this theory. Eliminate as much stress as possible in his life, and see if he gets significantly better.\\nHi, this is true. We are still keeping his appt with the Hopkins doctor. I really  am interested in alternative medicine though. We even thought about a holistic approach, all of this medicine changing is not good either. After a while the meds doesn\\'t even work.',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi All,\\n\\nI\\'m new to the board, but was hoping to find someone that has experience with ovarian cancer as I am not sure where to turn here.\\n\\nMy story is that I had experiencing abdominal bloating and some just weird contracting on my right side where my ovary would be. I went to the gyn where he took a CA-125 and transvaginal ultrasound. The ultrasound showed some fibroid tumors, but nothing too crazy looking. The CA-125 test came back elevated to 42. We decided to wait 2 more months and take another blood test. At this point, it came back 70. He told me I needed a laparoscopy - which I had last week. The gyn tells me he does not see anything unusual on my ovaries but possibly some scar tissue which he cut away. I ask then what would cause the elevated ca-125 - he says he really is not sure and that we will take another blood test in 3 months. Of course this is scaring the daylights out of me. My question is, do I start examing other avenues, is this the beginning stages of ovarian cancer and I am just sitting by and waiting? Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions.\\nI have ovarian cancer.  The best way to diagnose ovarian cancer is surgically so if the doctor didn\\'t see anything when he was in there then you are probably okay.  usually you wouldn\\'t have any symptoms of ovarian cancer until the later stages and if you were in the later stages the Dr would have noticed.\\nI just had a CA-125 done cause I have had swollen lymph nodes in my back and under my jaw fro months now and I\\'ve been on antibiotics for 3 weeks with no improvement.\\n\\nCA-125 is not just for ovarian cancer. It is best known ovarian cancer, but having it elevated can mean that there are other malignant cancers, like in the endometrium, fallopian tubes, lungs, breast and gastrointestinal tract.\\nYou can have a false positives from  normal ovulation, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, the first trimester of pregnancy, fibroid tumors, and other sources of inflammation in the abdominal and pelvic organs (liver disease, pancreatitis, etc). Also, cervical, endometrial, and other cancers (among them breast, colon, and lung) can inconsistently cause a rise in CA 125.\\n\\nSince you have fibroids I think that is a good possibility that is why you have an elevated CA-125\\nThank you both for the information.  I swear these doctors make me crazy - I wonder why he couldn\\'t have given me all of that information instead of letting me sit here and go crazy.\\n\\nI wish you both the best of luck with your situations and I will keep you posted on mine\\n\\nI\\'m one of those people to put things off, but this is one time that I wouldn\\'t wait around.  Probably this is nothing, but why take a chance.  I\\'d see another doctor for a second opinion.  Ovarian cancer is a \"silent\" cancer and a lot of women are not diagnosed until it has advanced.  The bloating is one symptom of ovarian cancer.  Read Fran Dresser\\'s book \"Cancer Smancer\" (probably spelling her name wrong, she\\'s \"The Nanny\").  You\\'ll kick yourself if it turns out to be cancer and you waited around while it advanced.  And if it\\'s not cancer...at least you have piece of mind.\\nHi\\nSorry for what you are going through.\\nI also had a CA-125 done which was normal.\\nYou mentioned the doc saw some scar tissue??  That is most probaly Endo.  I have heard (and I am stressing that I have heard) that Endo can cause your CA-125 test to elevate.  I had Adenomyosis (Endometriosis Interna) and PCOS.\\nIf I was in your shoes, I would also contact your GOP and discuss this with them as well.  Are you comfortable with your OB??  You must be comfortable with him or her and trust them.  I was comfortable with mine till I got real sick and he did absolutly nothing for me.  I eneded up with another OB and had a hyst.  Now I am fine.  I was rel sick before.\\nI am not a doctor, but I wouldnt brush this aside.  I would demand some answers !!!!',\n",

My uro doctor there just was surprised that doctor didn\\'t find them. I was very glad to get those out. They were 8mm and I can\\'t remember how big the other one was.\\n\\nHave any of you had lithotripsy and not all the pieces come out til a year or more later? I am asking because I think that has happend to me.\\n\\nI am glad that there are others here to share with although I was none of us had to be dealing with kidney stones and other health issues.\\n\\nThanks.\\nSnodove\\nSeems like most of us on this board are female.  Ironically one of my tales of wow is that one of the best doctors in NY may be able to help me but I can\\'t get in the front door - the reception refuses to admit that women can get stones!!!\\nsnodove,\\n\\nI am lucky in that I actually found a female uro!\\nShe is wonderful and has been watching me closely since I have been putting off getting my stones out.  I have an 8mm stone in my left kidney that has not moved yet but I have a feeling that I am going to have to get that sucker out soon before I get into trouble because she says I will not be able to pass it.  I too am amazed that there are so many women on this site that have stones.  They are alot more common that people think.\\n\\n2plus,\\n\\nYou still have trouble getting in to see them? grrrrrrrr I really wish I could send my doc up to you..She is awesome and I know she could help...\\n\\nTerry\\nHi, Are you serious. That is crazy huh. I used to think when you read the information it sounds like not many women get stones but I think that is changing. They need to let you in to see the doctor!\\n2plus, That is wonderful you found a good uro doctor and she is female. I hope you can get your stone blasted soon. I had a 10 mm stone a few yrs back and it about killed me. I knew I had a stone and thought oh I will pass it. Wrong.\\nI had to go to the ER the next morning. I was so sick. I hope you will take care of that before it gets that bad.\\nI wish we had more uro doctors in my area. We have 3. The one I go to is one that replaced my old one. Thank God for that. Seriously, my old one I had gotten when I was in the hospital once and he told me I didn\\'t have those 3 stones and I went to Cleveland Clinic with them. Geez what a mess that whole thing was. But I was very thankful they took care of it. Then I came back home and went to him one more time and he retired. I like my uro doctor now and he is good I think but sometimes I wish he would try to do more follow up.\\nHe has me on meds and potassium but he just keeps it that way.\\nSometimes I think he needs to regulate it more. I will talk to him next time I go in but I try to not have to go often if I can help it.\\nI sure hope you get your stone taken care of soon. Does Lithotripsy bother you much. They have improved it so much since my first one in 90. It is nice to have others that understand here. If you haven\\'t ever had a stone you have no idea what it is like. My family tries to understand but at times they just don\\'t. They think you will kind of get over it. Then there are all the xays ect and that can get frustrating when nothing shows up but you have symptoms. That is what I am going thu right now.\\n\\nThanks for posting.\\nSnodove\\nHi:\\n\\nI think many women get kidney stones, but because urologists are mostly interested in male functions and dysfunctions, we get ignored.\\n\\nBy the time my stones were discovered, I had to have my right kidney removed.\\nHi, I think you are right we do get ignored. Wow you mean because of stones they had to remove your kidney. Did you have large ones or just alot to have to have that happen. I am sorry !!! I have often wondered if Lithotripsy and having stones effects your kidneys. Thank you.\\nI have had kidney stones since 98 and have had at least 10 lithotripsys, 1 surgery throught the back, and 1 uretscopy.\\n\\nI got lucky w/ my male uro as he has never treated me like a woman should not get kidney stones.  Sometimes it\\'s weird in the waiting room when most of the other patients are men & they look at me like \"what\\'s she doing here?\".\\n\\nI had 3 procedures this summer and the stone has broken up some but I still have about a 6mm stone in the left kidney w/ some pieces and a small stone in the right.  Now we are going to wait a year unless I feel I need to see him again.\\n\\nYou should see if you can get a referral to a nephrologist who specializes in just kidneys as they can work at trying to find out why you make stones and suggest changes of diet and for me put me on a drug regimen (Urocit-K and hctz) to try a reduce stones from forming or getting biggers.  So far I keep making so I\\'m going to ask next month if I could possibly have a thyroid disorder causing me to make stones.\\n\\n\\n\\nHi, thank you. Wow you have been thu alot too. You have had a few more lithotripsies than I have. I have had I think 4. I would have to look it up. Lol\\nI thought about seeing a nephrologist. My uro doctor has been good to me thu.\\nI have to admit. He cares alot. He said when they are as small as mine are now not much you can do but pass them. I used to have larger ones but since I have been on Poassium Chloride and Urocit-K ( 5 pills a day ) plus a duerutic .  think it has helped slow them down. Just wish they would stop.\\nI had a thyroid test and they said that it didnt look like a cause.\\nI do have a Renal Calcium leak. Thank you so much. I am sorry you are having all these stones. I usually go about 2 yrs without trouble now but It used to be every year.\\nHope you can get some help.\\nI have been having kidney stone since I was 14 and I am now 40, they just seem to come faster and faster.  I have had lithotripsy about 15 times as well as multiple other proceedures.   As a matter of fact, I had Lithotripsy last Dec and then I was addmitted twice this year and had another outpatient lithotripsy just this past may.\\nTo say that I am sick and tired of Kidney stone would be a huge understatment.\\nI have just found that there is information about kidney stones being related to IBS.  Generally, from what I have read,  the theory is that if you have IBS with constant diarrhea you are also constatly dehydrated, leading to low functioning kidneys.\\nAnyone out there have both IBS  and Kidney stones?\\nHi, I am so sorry you have had to go through all this with stones since you were 14. I didn\\'t have my first one that early. You asked about IBS. I have IBS but am consipated more than anything. I think sometimes with IBS your system doesn\\'t function right and I can see how it would cause stones.\\nThank you.\\n( this didn\\'t want to load the first time. Sorry for the repeat post below)\\nHi, I have IBS but with C. Not sure if tha make a difference with stones or not but  I can see how it would with IBS D.\\nHard to know huh. I think that with stones there can be so much going on with your system that if it isn\\'t just working right or you have the slightest imbalace it causes stones. I have to much calcium in my urine and it is a renal calcium leak. They used to say don\\'t eat calcium and now they say do and not eat alot of oxalate. Who knows . LOL.\\nI also have IBS with constipation.  I\\'ve had kidney stones off and on since I was 20.  I\\'m now 57.  I had a Lithotripsy 2 months ago.  I\\'ve been drinking more water than I ever have before b/c I don\\'t want to go through this again anytime soon.  The Lithotripsy cost over $20,000.  I couldn\\'t believe it when I found out.  Thankfully, I had already met the deductible and the hospital was contracted with our insurance, so I only had to pay a little over $1,000.  It\\'s just insane though that Drs. and hospitals can charge so much for a non-invasive procedure or \"surgery\" as they call it.\\nHi, I am 49 and I have noticed lately the older I am getting instead of every other year I am getting stones about every month. Small ones but still....\\n\\nWOW where did you get lithotripsy done....\\nMy last one was 9,000 at a local hospital here about 2 yrs ago.\\nThat had gone up alot.\\n\\nThen at Cleveland Clinic I had one done there and they broke up 2 stones.\\nIt was a huge machine, it was 13,000.\\nI remember when it uesd to cost about 2,000 to 3,000 to have lithotripsy done. you are right it is crazy.\\n\\nThank you for answering my question and I hope you feel better.\\nSno - talk to your ob/gyn about your stones, it can be due to hormonal changes and she may be able to help you level them out a bit more.',\n",

I have tried Nexium and Prilosec and maybe something else. And after a few days I start gettng throat spasms which scare me and I stop the meds. Has anyone had this weird side effect? I really need to be taking a ppi but don\\'t know what to do. Should I keep trying all the various brands? Other types of anti-acids (not the ppis) don\\'t seem to do the job. I usually never take any allopathic meds at all. But I really need to get my acid under control because it\\'s causing me horrible mucus issues. Has anyone found a natural alternative that works just as well (some herbal formula, etc.) ?\\nHello,\\nCan u describe what u mean by spasms in your throat.  Does it hamper\\nyour breathing at all, I think I may experienced something similiar, I have severe gerd, acid reflux or all of the above.

Let me know.\\nsea\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyes please describe more I may have had that to on a ppi.\\nHello all.\\nMy only symptoms from GERD are the severe reflux burning in my chest and throat, no spasms or stomach pain. I used to wake up at night choking also from the reflux in my throat, but now that I use a slanted elevated pillow, major improvement now. My GERD started about 10 years ago, was on Prilosec 9 of the 10 years and now Nexium about a year with no problems. I\\'m going to try ginger tea and licorice extract.  I\\'ve heard the probiotics like yogurt are good too. One day I want to get off PPIs completely because I\\'m concerned about their negative long term use.\\nAmber\\namber,\\n\\nmy doctor just told me to use 2x4s to raise my bed. He says it will help stop the reflux from coming up into my throat at night & causing me to choke. I think I\\'ll try some plywood, maybe a couple of sheets or so under the upper part of the mattress. I tried sleeping on several pillows but it didn\\'t help much plus I can\\'t sleep that way. Last night was the worst one ever. I got no more than a couple of hours of interrupted sleep. The acid coming up makes me feel as if I am drowning. I hope to get more sleep tonight. I am so tired...\\nHi Everyone,\\nfor me, after a couple of days on any PPI I get throat spasms. It\\'s as if I can feel the sphincter/muscle contracting quickly. And like I wasn\\'t breathing for a few seconds/had to catch my breath. It\\'s weird because PPIs are supposed to cure these things, not cause them. When I tried to explain this to drs, they didn\\'t believe me because it\\'s not listed as one of its side effect. So I don\\'t know what to do. Has anyone else experienced esophagus spasms from PPIs? If i thought that it was a good reaction and healing something, then I\\'d keep taking it. But it feels very scary so I don\\'t take them right now.\\nI was doing some reading and these muscle spasms may be caused by faulty calcium metabolism and associated with diminished function of the parathyroid glands. So maybe the PPIs are upsetting the calcium balance in the stomach. Maybe they\\'re depleting magnesium levels. I wonder if something like Tri-Salts by Ecological Formulas would help restore the balance. Or maybe some other natural supplement. I\\'ve tried Tri-Salts for a couple days so far. I have symptoms of Laryngopharyngeal reflux and I don\\'t know if this is powerful enough to help with that. But it is said to neutralize increased acidity.\\nI agree , I have found PPI\\'s cause weight gain-\\nJust as SSRI\\'S do-\\nThank you for the information, Stardust!\\n\\nThe muscle spasms are extremely painful and scary. I had mine happen in the upper abdominal  area, not throat, with a bulge present. Totally creepy. I suspected the hiatal hernia. The doctor said no big deal, eveyone gets them. Not the type I had!!!\\nThey remain unexplained.  I do know that electrolyte deficiencies can cause spasms. I take calcium & magnesium supplements. I am on a sodium restrictive diet, so who knows if a temporary low sodium level might have caused them.\\n\\nflowergirl\\nHi flowergirl2day\\nYeah, in the body Calcium, Sodium and Potassium have to be in proper balance.\\nDear Flowergirl and Stardust,\\nWow, I read your thread. I have posted on areas here but still looking for a solution to my problem. I have had chest pain, severe at times since Jan. I started PPI\\'s plus antibiotics for H pylori. I have had this chest pain off and on for almost a year. Sometimes really bad, sometimes just a squeezing. Had a complete cardiac workup-normal, GB taken out ( had stones) and still chest pain..... this is so great I read this tonight. I was also diagnosed with low Parathryoid levels/ low vitamin D... and Dr\\'s could not say why it happened. I think I will stop the PPI\\'s and see if it goes away. How after you stop taking PPI\\'s does the spasms stop??  I take calcium/magesium every day so I thought I was covering this area. Please let me know how you all are doing and maybe we can figure this out together. Thanks and God bless!!\\n\\nHi again!! I wanted to add to alternative remedies for PPI\\'s. I read somewhere on this site that Pinenut oil  and apple cider vinegar as a natural remedy. I personally have not tried it. Good luck and let us know if you do try it.\\nHi tired,\\n\\nThe calcium and magnesium seems to have stopped the spasms, which is great. However, my nausea is worse again and so are the nightly episodes of drowning/choking (which is what I call them, but basically it\\'s just the acid backing up, at least that\\'s what I think.). That is my biggest problem right now. These choking episodes now seem to also happen during the day and are not restricted to nights anymore. I am thinking of calling my internist and scheduling an early appointment. I am supposed to be seeing him in a few weeks. I don\\'t know if I can wait that long. Needless to say, I wish I didn\\'t have to be dealing with this particular health issue. I am still wondering if any of my medications could be causing these highly unpleasant symptoms.\\nI took apple cider vinegar in the past. It is great for a number of things. I didn\\'t have these problems then and took it for another reason. That\\'s why I can\\'t tell how well it works in reducing the acid reflux. I\\'ll start taking it again - there\\'s a bottle of organic ACV in the fridge right now. I haven\\'t tried the pine nut oil but feel I should look into it. Good luck with your spasms!\\n\\nflowergirl\\nDear flowergirl2day,\\nI wanted to tell you I went to the Endocrinologist for check up , Calcium, magnesium, Parathryoid and vitamin D levels. The D and parathryoid were very low this August and I felt terrible. Took mega Vitamin D and felt better. I asked if PPI\\'s could affect this and she said definitely YES!!( I think I asked GI dr. and they said NO). PPi\"s affect absorption of these minerals.... wow, news to me. She suggested taking PPI early am and minerals in later afternoon and evening ( break up calcium or it is just excreted). She said 5-6 hours between PPI and minerals is good, not 1-2 as pharmacy suggests. Hope this helps someone out there.\\nAs for me I felt better with chest pain and last night had reflux and \"acidy feeling\" stomach. I did not eat much at all, and very bland diet. How long til your \"spasms\" went away after stopping PPI. I have been on it for almost 11 months, Prilosec, Nexium, Protonix and now was taking Acidphex. I don\\'t want to go back to gastritis, esophagitis so I am looking for some relief.  They have told me all my chest pain is from esophageal spasms, cause unknown.  Should I have cut  PPI dose slowly,cut pill in half or taken every other day???? Any ideas from anyone. But the chest pain is there again today, not as severe but annoying and this is day 3 of no PPI. Shouldn\\'t it be getting better??????\\nI go back to Gi Dr. end of Nov. Any ideas/info is greatly appreciated. god bless all and Happy Thanksgiving.\\nTired,\\n\\nthank you very much for your post. I will take your doctors\\' advice and take my calcium/magnesium/vitamin D supplement in the evenings from now on. I take my vitamins/supplements in the mornings with my medications. I did not know a 5-6 hour interval between the PPI and cal/mag supplement is recommended and really appreciate your sharing this. I have no doubt that  the PPIs affect metabolism and absorption. And, possibly, a few other things as well. I have not stopped taking mine, though am beginning to wonder if I should. I will let my specialist make that decision. The cal/mag/vitD supplements took care of my cramps & muscle spasms. They happen when the drugs we take (or various health conditions) cause us to have electrolyte deficiencies.\\nI hope someone else out there has a few tips regarding quitting the PPIs.\\n\\nGood luck to you!\\n',\n",

       " {'post': \"I am in need of some advice.  My 7 1/2 month old daughter has been the best little baby until just recently.  For the last 5 - 6 weeks, she has been battling colds, vomiting and diarrhea.  I think most of it has cleared up now, but since all this started, she has begun screaming everytime I leave her sight.  She even does this if I sit her down on the floor and I stand up.  The only way she doesn't do this is if I am holding her.  Even sometimes when I pick her up, she still screams.  I don't think it comes from me holding her too much since she was born, because we have tried not to do that.  She is my second child so she always has her big sister around but that doesn't even help.  I don't know why she has started this or if it is a normal stage.  Also, what should I do, just let her keep screaming?  She can be screaming and I will walk in and sit beside her without picking her up, but that doesn't do  the job.  She still keeps screaming and crying.  Someone, please shed some light on this and help me handle the situation.  I appreciate any help I can get!  Kim\\n\\nHi Kim, I am not sure if I will be of any help, but I thought I would try!\\nWhen my son was around your daughters age, he also went through a unhealthy time and also a major crying phase (and I stress, phase!). He was about 8 months and contracted a terrible stomach flu, which lasted 5 days, then it went straight into a cold, and then ended up in the hospital about 5 or 6 weeks later with the croup!!! Needless to say, I was a nervous wreck! When I look back on it, I think the crying thing was partially because of me being so paranoid of every little squeak he made while he was sick and rushing to comfort him, or pick him up. Also, he was teething really bad at that point so I am sure that didnt help the situation! The good news is, after that winter from hell, he returned to the sweet, non-screaming baby that he was before\\nI really think their teeth have alot to do with it. They just dont know what else to do when they are in pain. Good Luck, sorry I babbled on forever, but I love talking about babies!!!\\n\\nSmiles,\\nHoney\\nHey, I just noticed you are a fellow Hoosier!  I live in Indianapolis! Talk to you later\\n\\nHoney\\nHoney, thanks so much for your response.  Our situations sound so much alike.  The only difference is that she hasn't been in the hospital yet, thank goodness.  I am just about to go nuts.  I keep thinking that once she starts crawling and eventually walking things could get better.  I am hopeful.  Do you think I should just let her cry it out so that she will learn that she can't be held all day?  I am so stressed, I don't know what to do with her.  She is screaming as we speak, but I am letting her go to see if she eventually stops.  Anyway, thanks again and it is good so see a fellow Hoosier on the boards.  Kim\\n\\nHey, Kim! I hope your baby girl is better! You mentioned maybe the screaming and crying would stop (or lessen\\n) when she starts crawling and walking around, that could definitely be true! I looked back in my son's babybook and he didn't start crawling until he was about 9 months old! He was pretty chunky, so that probably didn't help much, but I do remember thinking that maybe he was bored, or agitated because he could'nt get to something he wanted. There are so many things that you can think of, but I would guess that it is a mixture of wanting to be held all the time, especially if she is under the weather, and just the age! I used to lay him in his crib for a nap and he would scream at the top of his lungs! I felt terrible but I would go in my room and watch the news, or something and TRY to tune him out! I know that probably sounds terrible, but it paid off! I would let him cry for awhile and then I would peek in his room just to make sure he was okay, but I would not get him out of the crib, no matter what. It took a couple weeks of pure hell, I let him cry up to 30 to 40 minutes (still checking on him) He could fight sleep with the best of them! But eventually he stopped, and he sometimes would start to fuss when we left the room, but he would stop after a couple seconds because he knew it was time to go to sleep. It really sucks, I know, but believe me it will get easier! Does she have any teeth yet? If not, check for red or swollen gums, she might need some ambesol!\\nGood luck, chat with you later!\\nFriend from Indy,\\nHoney\\nHoney, good to hear from you again.  I did a test run on Courtney yesterday.  I put her on the floor of the living room with a ton of toys and went about my business of cleaning and doing bills.  She did scream alot so I just got out of her sight all together.  She kept screaming but I think that she finally she got tired of it and slowed down on it quite a bit.  Then today, she would start to do the same thing but if I would let her see me and she would know that I was still around, she quieted down some.  I have not picked her up any of these times until I knew she was very sleepy and hungry.  Also, I tried putting her in her bouncy chair and let her feed herself.  That helped a tone.  She is really good about going to sleep on her own in her crib.  She was always good about it before she got sick, then she fought sleep alot, but now she seems to be going back to putting herself to sleep.  I am lucky in that respect.  She does have two teeth on the bottom, but I know she is trying to get more just by the way she is gnawing the heck out of everything.  She slobbers like crazy (She has done that since she was born though)  Anyway, I am going to try to just let her cry things out and break herself of this.  Hopefully it will all work out for the better.  I'll keep ya posted!  Thanks again for all your advice!  Kim\\n\\nTeething could be the problem.  My little one busted all 4 molers at 13 mo and for a week needed extra attention.  Also my youngest, same one had Gerd and was never consolable and since Nov. 16mo we started just to let her cry and now at 21 mo she is so less dependant on us.  It was hard.  I felt as though my child only cryed and I was a bad mom.  I am so glad she has come around.  The test is how does she do with others when your not there?  I wish you the best!\\nI too have an 8 month old who just recently was running a fever of 102+.  He was very irritable and unconsolable.  If I even left his sight for a second he would whale!!  It took him several days to get over this too.  I think that they feel vulnerable when they are sick and are afraid that mommy/daddy if out of sight won't be there to comfort them. So not to worry it will get better with health I think.  I have a 6 year old who brings everything under the sun home.  It has been a very rough winter!!  Good luck to you and your family.\",\n",

She eats candy I try to limit her but they even give it to her at school. She gets it from her dad as well. She gets multi-vitamins and she eats the most fattening of foods that I can get but either she doesn\\'t eat enough of it or she has to much energy and wears it off. She also eats food that is very good for her. She loves Brocoli and fruit. She always says her stomach hurts, which means either she is full or she has to go to the bathroom.

Not to be to invasive of your personal life or situation, but are you divorced? Does your daughter go to visit her dad on weekends? If so ... I would venture to say that yes, she is dealing with a lot of stress. Kids have a way of not showing the stress, or what is bothering them. I have two young children (son 9 and daughter 7) that live with their mother. My son is already counting the years until he can live with dad ... and my daughter is so torn that it is affecting her as well. My daughter is a very good eater (when she is with me), but she is so thin and frail. That is another story, but sounds as though there are similarities here.\\n\\nAnther thing I agree with from a previous poster here,\\n. Just because a person is a doctor (or a lawyer, or any other professional for that matter) doesn\\'t mean they are good.\\n\\nAbove all else, try and keep her young life as \"\\n\" as you can, and don\\'t put to much emphasizes on these matters where your daughter can tell it is an issue.\\n\\nGood Luck ... and keep us informed.\\nDave\\nHi Dave,\\nNo we are not divorced but my husband is a Truck Driver and isn\\'t home too often.  He feels bad so he brings her candy. I think  my daughter does feel my stress and pain. I am not well and I have bad days that my temper is short. I am sure these things affect her. But I still feel there is something else going on. Like if she eats cereal, she wants it but only eats alittle. Everything she wants and gets she doesn\\'t finish. I am over weight also I wonder if she sees this and doesn\\'t want to be over weight. Anyways. I am working on making her dinner and breakfast fun. I hope that it will help her eat better. Right now though her Grandpa is in ICU on Life Support and I just got out of the hospital. She is worried I know But she doesn\\'t understand how seious  Grandpa is. I want to prepare her for the worst but I am so worried it will cause her to stop eating. Thanks for your help if you have any other suggestions now that you know whats going on please feel free to write. Thanks Raven\\n\\nHi Raven ....\\n\\nReal quick here, as I am getting ready to head to the office.\\n\\nWell, it\\'s good to hear mom and dad are both in the house, that eliminates that problem. From what you say though, I can see where there probably is a lot of stress on your daughter, or maybe I should say there are a lot of things that make her think. At 6 though, I wouldn\\'t think that she would put together your weight issue and eating at this early age.\\n\\nI went through the death of my mother when my kids were very young. Corbin remembers Grandma, but Megan was too young at the time. When we talk about Grandma, we say she is our \"Special Angel\" ... and the kids really accept that. Corbin says that he is special to have a special angel, and has even asked me if I had a special angel when I was young. I took the kids to the cemetary one day, and I was totally suprised at how they accepted it. They told Grandma that they loved her, and that they missed her. I have other family members there as well, and they showed an honest interest in all of it. I was reluctant at first to take them, but they have accepted it very well.\\n\\nMy thoughts now would be to take your daughter to another doctor, or to a specialist. It can never hurt to have a second opinion. Maybe her doctor can recommened her to a Nutritionist. That would probably be a good place to start. If the doctor tries to say she doesn\\'t need to see a specialist, then I would most certainly find a new doctor.\\n\\nGood Luck .....\\nHave a Great Day ...\\nDave\\n\\n\\n[This message has been edited by moderator1 (edited 12-02-2000).]\\nRaven take heart I too have a 6 year old who also is very very thin 40lbs she is all arms and legs happy bouncy and vibrant.\\nI dont\\' feed her the most fattening things i can find but try for the healthy ones she eats huge amounts of fruit, bread,and rice (she loves it) not that she doesn\\'t get the take out stuff.\\nTry peanut butter, honey and banana sandwiches it sound yuck but try one they are sooo good. When making soups and stews add rice or lentils or pasta. Use only full cream dairy products and add full cream milk powder to any muffins you make along with the hidden goodies like raisens, saltanas, dried apricots. Add bananas to milk shakes along with milk powder and yoghurt and a dobb of ice cream.Get her to help make these it is fun and she will start a conection with the ritual of food.\\nDon\\'t make a big thing about eating kids always resist it they will either over eat or under eat. remember what we do to them now will affect their whole life.\\nMy pediatrition told me not to worry too much as a child will rearly eat too much or to little if left to there own devices.\\nIf she is full of energy don\\'t worry it could be genetic a throw back to a skinny relative. But if she isn\\'t got to another Doc and get her checked for diabetis.\\n\\nHope I\\'ve Helped a little, please let me know\\n\\n[This message has been edited by Thai (edited 12-29-2000).]\\nHi Raven. I\\'m new here but your post caught my eye. I have a 9 year old daughter who weighs 44pounds.... WAY underweight for her age and she looks like a charity poster fro famine relief\\nShe is weighed at the hospital on a regular basis and the last two times got told off as she had LOST weight (she\\'s back up a tiny bit now)\\nHowever. She is healthy.. she is NEVER ill, she has unbounded energy and enthusiasm for life. She also has ADHD..hyperactive type.\\nI was told ADHD-ers are often small and underweight (even before medication) as they kinda burn all their calories off... just a thought..is she very active?\\nmy Abby also has very poor circulation..her feet and hands are blue and I have often wondered if it\\'s connected but no one seems able to tell me.\\n\\nI have tried everything to get Abby to eat, but I have stressed myself more than I have ever managed to increase her intake. Aby has many sensory issues and refuses most textures, only eats pure white chikcen, wont chew any othe meat, won\\'t eat \\'kids\\' food (Mc Donalds etc). It is frustrating. However she\\'ll eat rsaw vegetables and odd things like that.. all healthy,but not designed to help her gain weight!!\\nI think the main issue is whether your little girl is healthy or not. If she is pitifully thin AND unhealthy/energyless etc then you need another doctor and some serious help, but if she is bouncing with health and happiness, it may be just how she is for now... you may have to ride it out until she is older.\\n\\nIt\\'s awfully hard I know\\nHUGS\\nTufty\\nMom to Abby 9 ADHD SID, Zach 7, Lucy 6 Charlie 3.7 Hypotonia, speech and developmental delays, seizures , connective tissue disorder cute as can be...\\nTufty Hi there,\\nI thought my daughter was small but I really feel for you. My son also has sensory problems and wont even put meat in his mouth for the most part and I don\\'t even think of offering eggs unless it is very hard boiled and only the yoke.\\nThe only thing I could think of that may help is milk shakes if she will have them, or flavoured milks, to this I would add full cream milk powder and yoghurt also Ice cream if she doesn\\'t mind the texture. Also those powders that body builders use are usually full of callories ask you diettion about them it might help.\\n\\nAlso on another matter my son(4) has a language and development delay if you would like to converse with some one who has the same problems leave me a message and we\\'ll talk\\nHello,\\nAfter reading all the post about underweight children, it prompted me to write about mine as well. I have identical twin daughters that had TTTS (twin to twin transfusion syndrome) when I was pregnant with them, for those that do not know what this is, it is when they share the same feeding cord ect..and one twin gets all the nutrients, food, ect..and the other doesn\\'t get enough. They were given a very small chance of living 30% to be exact but made it at 2 1/2 months early weighing in at 2 lbs. & 11 oz. and 1 lb. & 11 oz. My little girl that weighed one lb. more than her little sis has never had a problem with eating and I beginning to wonder if i should even start to monitor her eating habits at this age...she is always eating and even finishes her sisters plate when she doesn\\'t which is *TOO* often. She weighs 43 lbs. but is quite tall for her age. The doctor says there are only 5% of the children her age as tall as she is and my little one weighs 27 lbs. and is pretty normal in height for her age. She is very skinny! She will not eat anything hardly and is super active, but so is the other one. She will eat one or two bites of something and is finished. I let her eat whenever she wants because I feel that anytime she wants to eat it is good. Which runs into my other problem...The older larger twin feels like eating anytime and it is hard for me to not let her eat when I let the other eat anytime she wants to as well. Do you see my problem. I don\\'t want to let the bigger one go around eating all the time because I am afraid that she will just get plum fat...but I don\\'t want to make a big deal of eating issues with her at this age. Since they are identical twins and the only ones in the family it seems like everyone makes a big deal at how big the one is and how little the other is and I find them making playful remarks that worry me will bother them in the future. Their doctor isn\\'t worried a bit about the bigger one and he says the little one will eat when she is ready to. He doesn\\'t seem to think it is a problem. I really don\\'t think there is anything wrong with the way she eats but I just wish I could find something to help her gain. Pediasure and such is out of the question for that stuff is waaaay to high for me to afford to buy since the other one would want some too (sigh)! It seems they started out like this from day one when I was pregnant with their weight gain and the TTTS they had. If anyone knows of anyone who had twins and had this as well, and their growth rate was the same or diff. please let me know or if anyone knows some suggestions with the problems I have mentioned when having two little ones in the house with different dieting ways please let me know. Hope to hear some suggestions soon.\\nHi I just wanted to share my story.\\n\\nMy daughter is 6 1/2 now and weighs 38 LBS  when she just turned 6 she was about 36 LBS.  She is rather small for her age, the size of about a 4 1/2 yr old.  She was born normal weight and height, but she just kept getting further and further behind.  But I never really worried about how much she ate.  She is a normal little girl, and is very healthy.  As a baby she never once consumed an 8 oz. bottle.  Her eating habits are still much the same.  She eats like a bird.  She doesn\\'t look undernourshied at all, just like a normal kid, but still wearing slim sized clothes, and is the smallest in her first grade class.  Just watch what she eats, is she eating a variety of foods.  We set limits at dinner time, she has to eat at least so much meat, so much potatoes/stuffing etc, and so much vegetables. and has to take at least one bite of something new (vege\\'s)  I also tell her she has to drink her milk in her cereal bowl. Even if we go to McDonalds, I say \"at least 4 nugget\" and that is a big deal, she hardly touches her french frys; And I don\\'t let her play until she has finished eating. Don\\'t let her fill up on liquids at dinner time, especially on pop, this is always a problem at restaurants b/c they bring the drink long before the food.  We waste more food and money on her than she ever eats. Also I\\'d like to note, that if I don\\'t keep an eye on her eating on the weekend, she\\'ll go all day without eating except one meal.  This is not healthy and it is hard to keep track of someone elses eating if they are not complaining of being hungy.    Don\\'t get into the habbit of giving your daughter high fat foods, as this will just lead to poor eating habits and poor health in adulthood. Because of her age, at 5 yrs old we switched to skim milk, b/c that is what\\'s recomended.  Try things like ensure, but as long as your daughter is not losing weight, and is steadily growing, even if it is slowly, I wouldn\\'t worry too much.  That is what our doctor said, just as long as things keep going in the RIGHT direction not the other way.  Some people are just smaller than others.  Besides with all the overweight kids in America, what do you really have as a comparison.\\n\\nOne last thing, I am only 5\\'3 and her dad is 5\\'4.  I was always small as a child and so was he, I kinda rely on the comfort of just knowing that we bred/produced a small child!!???? LOL\\n\\n[This message has been edited by Shaelle (edited 01-19-2001).]\\nThanks Everyone for your comments tips and support. My daughter is growning but slowly. It hit home on a couple of notes Shaelle said. My daughter always wants a drink and if I do not watch her she fills up on it before eating. She doesn\\'t like to drink her milk in her cereal bowl but does if I get on her. She does like candy and cereal more than anything too. so I always get asked for cereal or candy and I have to explain over and over that she needs to eat better food. But one thing I will say is, I don\\'t try to find the most fattening food but I guess a better way to word it is. I do not try to give her low fat foods. I go for Whole Milk Ice Cream, Sour Cream, Cheese and foods like that so there is added calories. She picks at her food, she eats like a bird and on weekends she has actually gone without eating three meals because like you said I forget to keep tabs on her eating habits. I know the blood tests says she\\'s healthy and she is active and looks good, but thin. But I still worry but I do notice she is concerned with her weight which I find strange at her age. She says things like. I don\\'t want to eat too much I might get fat or my tummy hurts because it is getting fat. Yeah right! There isn\\'t a oz of fat on her body!!!!! Should I be concerned about those comments? Thanks again. Raven\\nMy daughter has made comments about other kids as school--who comment on her size.  I tell her that I was too the smallest kid in class, and it is no fun.  And that she\\'ll catch up one day.  I am actually the one who makes the comments like, if you keep eating so much candy (she thinks she has to have some every day) you will get a butt like mommy\\'s.  I am overweight, and it runs in the family.  I do exercise, and I don\\'t skip meals in front of her.  She sometimes thinks that she should exercise too, and I tell her that she does not need to worry about that now, but when she is older, maybe a teenager, she might need to get into the habit of it then.  And we\\'ll worry about then when the time comes.  But she gets plenty of exercise now.  I try not to make the day revolve around eating though.  I think that is where my family has gone wrong, and why every one is so overweight.  But this overweightness doesn\\'t start setting in until about 22 yrs of age.  With the skim milk, what I am doing is trying to follow recommended nutritional needs for children her age.  And only eating high fat foods in \"moderation\".  The added cholesterol and usually salt in those higher fat foods, aren\\'t good for her either.  If they are around the house alot, and you are consuming those too, then she may be getting the message that as an adult, it is okay to eat those foods too.  And as adult, when we consume those kind of foods, we suffer the consequenses.    I will note that if we are having chicken for dinner, I will pick off the skin, have a little bite, (it\\'s so good) and set it aside, my daughter loves to eat it.  I let her have mine.  But I remember as a kid, I used to love that stuff too and I still do, but I don\\'t need those extra calories.  I don\\'t tell her this, I just say, I don\\'t want it.   Let her indulge sometimes, but not all the time, I\\'d day have the whole milk ice cream on hand only for treats now and then.  But keep yogurt handy for snacks.  My daughter loves those go-gurts.  I don\\'t buy potato chips that often (because I\\'ll eat\\'em) but we indulge now and then, may be once in a month or two.  My daughter also loves plain old saltine crackers, ???.  Apples and oranges.  She likes carrots, celery and cauliflower, only if she can dip them.  So I buy lite sour cream, not fat free. (I don\\'t tell her) and mix in the ranch dip stuff.  Great snack, with some cream in it too.  She also loves cereal too, and remember that cereal is a good source of the vitamins and minerals that she needs, even if it is sugar smacks.  Compare them at the store, they contain about the same amount of vitamins and minerals.  Though she hardly consumes a cup of cereal.  I wouldn\\'t worry about how small she is, it sounds like she\\'s pretty normal.  Just small.  Try to serve good foods that are healthy for every one in the family, and try for at least a 3 course meal. (meat, veggies, and what ever else.)  If I can only get two (like in a casserole), that is when we might have the ice cream. (yes the good stuff)  Just make sure she eats her food.  (that whole 6 oz)\\n',\n",

Just so you have some background information about me (since this is about my son) I have been diagnosed with Bipolar, Depression, Anxiety and Adult ADD and I have the positive markers for Lupus and have had the trademark butterfly rash but I have been way too busy with my son's appointments to go and see my dr, but I am next week all because I twisted my ankle 6 almost 7 weeks ago and the muscles are fine its the joint that is causing the pain.\\n\\nAnyways my son is 11, and in his 11 years he has been diagnosed with 24 different medical problems, the one he got at birth was Down syndrome (I know there is a board for Down syndrome but when I looked in it, it is some moms who are getting positive markers and higher functioning kids and I don't want to scare those soon to be momma's because Ryan is a rare case).  Anyways my biggest concerns right now are urology and after doing some research neurology.  I am having the hardest time trying to find a specialist that works with complicated kids.  I talked to the down syndrome clinic at Children's hospital and they said they couldn't help me that if I wanted to go there for an evaluation that I would have to start all over from scratch with genetics, I don't want to do that again, it wasn't me that caused the down syndrome it was his druggie biological sperm donor (he told me it was my fault when I told him about Ryan and Down syndrome I told him where to go and how fast to get there, he has nothing to do with Ryan, to Ryan my husband is daddy), anyways my husband and I had our own kids who are healthy as can be (and they are only 7 minutes apart in age and yes they are identical).  I was young when I had Ryan (I was 19 almost 20 when he was born and it gave my 2 younger sisters a crash course in not having sex before you get married).  I just don't know where to turn to, we went down to the University of Minnesota Urology and she said that she would find some names of specialists, well they are not taking in new patients, the one that I have found online in Minnesota spends half her day at the hospital doing rounds and is the Chief of Staff at Children's Hospital and no she isn't taking in any new patients.\\n\\nI am making the trip down to the Mayo Clinic the beginning of September to see what they have to say (I didn't like what the urologist said yesterday).  The problem is my son's brain structure is smaller than what it should be and his brain stem is smaller than what it should be considering the size of his brain so that is why we haven't been able to potty train him, he has what you would call a neurogenic bladder, he also has a fat lipoma along his lumbar region.  We have done bladder tests that have shown that he retains it so much that his bladder has been stretched up to his belly button, and in turn it causes fluid to be retained on his kidneys, his left kidney is damaged because of it.  I just can't seem to find the different procedures online that can be done.  The specialists have given me 4 options and none of them sound like a good fix for Ryan.\\n\\nI'm constantly running around and when we see specialists I hate telling the story all over again, even though there are changes with each specialist.  I just wish that I could have them all in one room at one time and just get it done and over with, they could talk to each other about  different ideas and what to do.  Oh I can dream can't I.\\n\\nOh and it was so bad yesterday at the U that I started crying in the doctor's office, I've always done my best to keep a positive outlook on things and not let my kids get worried, but I let my guard down and lost it, I couldn't help it.\\nHi Melliann...and let me tell you I feel for you and all the problems you and your son have.\\n\\nWhen my daughter was 7, she got a blood disorder and I went looking for help(this was 1983) and stumbled upon a woman who was starting a summer camp for disabled and able-bodied kids. We got involved for several years even though our daughter recovered. You may have seen her husband and son on TV...his dad pushes him in a 3 wheel chair on marathons. They've done the Boston marathon for over 20 years and even the Iron Man Triathalon. Rickie has CP and is non-verbal and the only motion he has control over is the sideways movement of his head. He uses that to tap a keyboard to communicate. He was the first one to use the new eye controlled communicators.\\n\\nAnyhow, through them, I met many moms and dads of severely disabled kids, many with Down. The first organization I learned about was NORD...National Organization for Rare Disorders....they are a clearing house for resources for rare disorders of all kinds. Check them out and ask about docs who treat the exact disorder your son has because they can find support groups and docs and research centers who are doing work on his particular kind of Down.\\n\\nBut the one thing I did learn from these moms is this...you have to become the doc in the middle of the tornado around you and him. All of them learned as much as they could(as I know you've done) and as overwhelming as it gets, you have to demand records and keep them straight and repeat the stories a hundred million times if that is what it takes to find the right doc. I know it gets tiring and that is why YOU need a support group whether it be in person or on-line. Find one. If the moms here are all dealing with new cases or possible birth defects, then ask if there are any moms of older kids out there to talk to. NORD should also have other resources.\\n\\nI have a ton of medical problems myself and I get so tired of telling the whole thing over and over and I go for therapy to help me stay sane. If you can afford it, treat yourself to some professional help.....it's a real sanity saver.\\n\\nAnd also resign yourself to the fact that sometimes you are left with the lesser of evils when treating your son. Sometimes there isn't an answer. And sometimes you may make mistakes and that is okay. You don't intend to make mistakes and that is why they are mistakes....no one, including you, should blame anyone if you do. Blame means there was intent to make that mistake and I know you would never hurt your son ....so no blame...ever. You do the best you can with the knowledge and power you have.\\n\\ngood luck and gentle hugs.............Jenny\\nI already see a therapist every 2 weeks, just not able to this month since Ryan doesn't have school.  I do have my next appointment with her the day the kids go back to school and she said if I need it I can talk to her on the phone.  I will check out NORD and see what I can find.\\nIs there any way you could call Cincinnati Childrens Hospital? I think they would really do their best for your child. My son has a neurogenic bladder as well as other things and the urology clinic there has been wonderful. They tried everything they could for my son not to have to have surgery but unfortunately he still needs it. But they have so many specialists there that your son could use. Neurology, urology are two of the ones my son sees.\",\n",

If you know of any walkers, bouncers or stationary toys that has neck and head support please let me know...Thank you.\\nLauren.. what youre looking for is termed assistive technology (AT).  If you dont already have an Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) through your local Early Intervention office (public schools will have this information) check into it.  Most of the time you can find a local advocate for special needs who can help you acquire these things.  Under some circumstances, these assistive devices can be special made for the child.\\n\\nAlso, under the IFSP your child is likely eligible for Occupational Therapy (OT) to help with dexterity issues, muscle balance, and things of the like.  Unfortunately many people have to hear of these things on their own and ask that they be implemented.\\n\\nAll of the related info can be found under IDEA or IDEIA (birth to three) Part C.  This is a federal law that outlines special needs education available to your child (age birth to graduation --or age 21).',\n",

I have seen some mentally challenged children and adults wear helmets so they won't hurt themselves if they hit themself or fall down and hit their head. Have you asked the doctor for something for him to remain more calmer. I know it must be difficult and I don't know how old he is. I sure hope you have a support team to work with and that he can use play to communicate what he wants.  I'm sure this can be very tiring and stressful for you.  God bless you.  Take care of yourself.\\nSelf-injurious behavior like head hitting usually starts as a need for stimulation and becomes a habit. My youngest son started having issues with head banging when he was four months old and it became increasingly often as he got older. I taught in a classroom with a boy with severe autism who would hit and bang his head to the extent that he wore a helmet for protection. I didn't want this for my son, so at an early stage I would place a headband on his head when I noticed he would bang his head. He would keep the band on for 15-20 minutes and would then remove it. This seemed to help keep the banging at bay. If he has a particularly bad day, we will sometimes use a pair gun ear mufflers which squeeze a bit tighter than the headband, plus offers noise reduction. We have been using the headband and ear muffs for a number of years. He's seven now and will sometimes place the headband on by himself when he needs the help.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hello all - I\\'m new to site - but have a question that has been bothering me for a while.  I am dating a man who has been divorced for 6 months (but separated for 4 years) The really odd thing was that the mother lived in the same house for those 4 years in separate rooms.  They lived separate lives but they felt it was better for the 3 boys to stay together for a while (boys are 17, 20 and 25) - this too I thought was odd.  The eldest has anxiety problems and doesn\\'t leave house much, won\\'t travel except to work and diagnoses himself with medical problems all the time, the middle boy (age 20) is never home, is lazy and \"appears\" to be spaced out all the time, and the youngest has a \"mental\" disorder which my boyfriend states is because he had seizures as a child.  He says the child has the mind of a ten year old, has ADHD and has motor skill issues.    The mother recently moved out (about 3 months ago) and does not have a relationship with the 3 boys.  Boys live with dad (my boyfriend).  What I see going on now is horrible.  My boyfriend seems to be \"buying\" their love now.  He gives them money, always buys things for them.  Which I guess could be guilt.  But the thing that bothers me the most is this.  The youngest never showers or brushes his teeth.  We just got back from 8 days of vacation and he only took 1 shower and brushed his teeth one time.  My boyfriend does not encourage hygiene and only laughs about it when I bring it up.  He says that\\'s just the way he is.  The child also does and says annoying things all the time and talks about stealing things and doing things that are completely outrageous and his dad does nothing.  This child is annoying to no end and the father (my boyfriend) says nothing nor corrects him or disciplines him.  He just ignores the ignorance and the obnoxious behavior.  The middle child is never home, and my boyfriend does not ever know where he is.  This child has come home numerous times with the car crashed up or wheels off car and has no idea what happened.  My boyfriend just takes the car, gets it fixed and hands him the keys back.  The car he uses was bought by my boyfriend and given to him and my boyfriend fills the car up with gas every week for him  He has no job nor intends to get one.  He is in college (part-time), and my boyfriend is \"okay\" with this.  I am concerened mostly of these two boys - mostly because of the hygiene issues, and the fact that my boyfriend does \"everything\" for the youngest one.  He gets up in the morning and makes him coffee (even puts in the sugar and cream), makes him breakfast, and serves it to him.  Runs all over the house when he wants something, etc.  When this boy yells for his dad to come look at something on the tv or computer, he runs to him.  He will even yell from his bedroom - hey dad get me a soda - and his dad does.  I don\\'t think this is healthy at all.  This kid is more than capable of doing all this himself.  When I asked the boy why he does this - he answers because I\\'m lazy.  I tried talking to my boyfriend about this, he got angry and told me that \"I just don\\'t understand\".  I\\'m not sure what to do as it is really getting on my nerves.  I think he should encourage the kid to do things on himself and teach him responsibility but he gets angry at me when I say that.  I\\'m so afraid to say anything anymore, but I cant\\' sit back and watch this behavior either.  What is it I\\'m missing here?\\nIt sounds like the father is use to caring for his sons no matter what the costs . I am thinking that the 17 year old should be in school and a program that meets his needs. With school their is structure and routine. This is very important for a chalenged individual is to stay on a routine and schedule. It is not a good thing if he is at home all day doing nothing and DAD waits onhim hand and foot. At least the other young man goes to college part time. He is productive even if he can do more. The father needs some guideance. He does not have to cater to his sons like that and it is not doing them any good or teaching them how to be independant. Maybe you could try and talk to your BF and help him understand that his sons can be doing so much more in their lives and be productive. Suggest to him about a Rehab Program that the son could learn job training skills . It is never a good idea for anyone not to have direction or focus in their lives.\\nIf the youngest son is never going to graduate from Harvard Law School, that\\'s ok.  However, a very important goal in the education of mentally challenged children is basic self care skills, and it sounds like no one is pushing him in that area.\\n\\nHe is eligible for special education services until he reaches 21 or earns the equivalent of a HS diploma.  Has he been in school at some point?\\n\\nThe middle son, yeah, Dad needs to stop fixing that car before the young man gets into a\\ncrash and badly injures or kills himself or someone else.\\n\\nIt\\'s not something your BF probably wants to think about, but ask him, \"What is going to happen to your sons when you can\\'t care for them anymore?  What if you got sick?  What then?\"',\n",

Fortunately her symptoms have been mild, but she used to hit a temp of 105.5 at least once per episode and has had some mild febrile seizure activity.\\n\\nI believe very firmly, despite what conventional medicine says, that this fever syndrome is primarily related to reactions to vaccinations.  My daughter's fevers started 2 weeks after she had her 12 month vaccinations - Hep A and Prevnar.  She had had some night terrors prior to this, but no fevers or infection issues.  It took me almost 2 years of fevers every 2 or 3 weeks, like clockwork, for me to connect them to the vaccinations, so unfortunately she is currently up-to-date on her childhood vaccinations, except influenza vaccinations.  Given a choice I will never have her receive another vaccination!\\n\\nMy daughter has been receiving homeopathic treatments from a homeopath in England and her episodes are growing milder and more far apart.  The treatments are aimed at correctling damage from vaccinations.\\nMy son (9yr) also suffers from PFAPA - it started just last September.  His fever's were unresponsive to Tylenol, Motrin and a combination of both.  I wanted to share a solution that has been working now every time I've tried it - brings his fever down 2 degrees within 10-15 minutes!\\n\\nItems needed:\\nHandkerchiefs (I used a pillowcase that I cut up)\\n4-5 Egg Whites\\n\\nBeat up the egg whites and then soak 2 handkerchiefs in them.

(I also wrapped a towel around that to keep from getting the mess everywhere).\\nAfter about 5 minutes, I check the handkerchiefs.  If they are drying out, I re-soak them in the eggwhites and wrap them around my son's feet again.\\nAfter about 10-15 minutes, his feet are incredible HOT but the fever has dropped down 1-2 degrees and eventually, is gone all together.\\n\\nI know this sounds odd - but I've tried this now three times and each time it has worked.

I have had many a problems with school and have ended up having to home school my son.  I could no longer bear the way he was being treated.  It has been a tough road but one that has helped him very much.\\n\\nMy thoughts and good wishes are with you and your son\\n\\ngsmom\\nPersonally I would call the police, there is absolutely no excuse for handcuffing a child.\\nYour childs personal rights were violated. I would not for one min. allow my son to be treated in this manner . Go to the higher ups and make your voice be heard. You need to be your childs advocate. I would not have my child in school until the problem is resolved.\\nNo child deserves to be treated this way , and to me it is obvious that the school does not have any training on special needs children. A child cannot be restrained in this matter .\\nThis is very wrong.\\noh my gosh, your child was abused and you need an IEP written with specific behavior interventions that the teachers must do and for SURE what you\\'re describing is not one of them.  i think i too would have called the police - it\\'s illegal to do a restraint like that i\\'m pretty sure.\\n\\ntell the director of special ed that you need an immediate IEP meeting to describe the exact steps to be taken when your son is having a difficult behavior and have people at the meeting to advocate for you to help with the plan ie a school counselor or autism advocate for the district, or school psych.\\n\\nlet us know what develops.\\nWhat a horrible thing to happen, sounds like your son has issues these teachers aren\\'t trained to handle.  Do a lookup on \"georgia autism\" and it will bring up the name of several agencies that can help.  The Autism Society of America can help you wade through this mess.  In our area we have an advocate who will go to school with the parents and help write the IEP\\'s and teach the teachers how to handle these children.  Hopefully, you\\'ll find someone like this in Ga.\\n\\nI\\'m another one who had to take my son out of regular school and homeschool, but he never encountered anything nearly as inappropriate as this event.\\n\\nYes, I have had that problem with the Wisconsin Public school system. We MONITORED their [lack] of state and federal compliance with the laws in effect and proved by their own documents that they did not meet state/federal standards at teaching our son. Unfortunately, it took us three years to amass the records--in the meantime, we attended all his IEP\\'s, engaged the services of an advocate for children with special needs, and fought them tooth-and-nail. In the end, the school system had to pay for our son to attend a special school over a hundred miles away that specializes in children with autism disorders, and we got 2 teachers and a principal removed. Hang in there and teach your child social skills and cues to help him understand behaviors, etc. This is something schools should teach kids with this difficulty [just like they  teach math and reading], but they don\\'t and won\\'t until you as the parent hold them accountable! And never mind that the laws support YOU; YOU have to prove negligence on their part BEFORE you are allowed to invoke the law! That\\'s why it took us so long to prove our case. Luckily, they didn\\'t totally destroy our son, but it was a near thing--if one doesn\\'t  have money in America, you are screwed! City/County/State agencies were no help--we finally got help and advice from a federal agency. My husband nearly became a\\nparalegal he researched so much law. My son is now 23 years of age and has adjusted well to living in assisted living; holds a job, and [despite his horrific experiences] is thinking of returning to school. So there IS hope for you and your son--hold on! You are welcome to email me if you wish. Reading material I HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND IS \"The Complete IEP Guide: How to Advocate for Your Special Ed Child\" By Attorney Lawrence M. Siegel ISBN # 0-87337-408-8 and \"Social Skills Training: For Children with Asperger Syndrome and Social-Communication Problems.\" (Asperger Syndrome is a higher functioning form of Autism, but it doesn\\'t make life any easier!) by Jed E. Baker, Ph.D. ISBN # 1-931282-20-X\\nDear Burtist,\\nThese actions by the school system, is not in any form, acceptable.\\nI agree that you need to look for an advocate as soon as possible. Special Ed Advocates are a Godsend. In addition to looking into the agencies that are listed I would contact my child\\'s Pediatrician now, Monday. I would explain to him what\\'s going on and ask him for help. He should know who to go to in the area. I know that it\\'s difficult that when things are the most difficult, you have to be the most vigilant, and get things done.\\nPlease keep us posted.\\nPeggy\\nYour son has been abused Id go to the school and kick seven shades of **** out of the preson who did it\\nPhone the police.\\nIts sickening the way some of our special kids are treated in society.What evil mind would do this to  a disabled child? I sincerly hope they\\'re made to see the error of their vile ways!\\n\\n(((((((((((((((hugsto burtist & son)))))))))))))) may the good Lord protect and care for your child\\n\\nHere\\'s another vote for homeschooling!!!  It\\'s posts just like these that remind me WHY I choose to homeschool my children.\\n\\nI am very sorry to hear that your child went through this, and feel that maybe a call to a local tv station may be in order!\\nWe\\'ve had a similar experience at our school, except our child was locked up.  Sometimes pinned to the floor by 4 adults - the list goes on...  I tried contacting the authorities and CPS would do absolutely nothing.\\n\\nWe found out that the laws regarding \"seclusion and restraint\" are different in every state.   Some states have absolutely zero regulations on how much and what type of seclusion and restraint is used on our special needs kids.  It\\'s insane!!\\n\\nWe received help from an autism specialist at the co-op level.  I don\\'t know if you have those kind of resources available, but if you do, it might be worth a try.  Another great resource that helped us a lot was getting an Independent Educational Evaluation.  If you don\\'t agree with your child\\'s placement or interventions, you can request an IEE at the school district\\'s expense.  I also had to hire a good lawyer and advocate to help me learn the law inside and out.  It\\'s amazing how much my child\\'s \"free and appropriate\" education has cost me out of pocket.\\n\\nI sincerely hope that things get better for your child!\\n\\nhi, my son who is almost 7 has aspergers and he to has had trouble with bullies and teachers just not understanding him so they label him as a naughty kid and treat him that way. my husband is in the RAAF and we move every 3 years and seem to come across this problem everywhere. even though he also has ADHD and seperation anxiety i seem to have no other choice but to home school him as i think you should do the same, it is up to us to protect our kids and the schools seem to failing us. good luck\\nI have a lot of experience in this area as Autism runs in my family along with ADHD, bipolar disorder and other associated disorders.

       " {'post': 'Today my son was diagnosed with PFAPA, or Marshall\\'s Syndrome.  I started searching and found this site.  So here it goes:\\n\\nBack in February of this year, my baby (15 months at the time) had his first seizure.  In 3 months he has had 7 febrile seizures (the big ones where his entire body twitches, his jaw locks, his toes curl under, etc. - it\\'s horrifying to watch), each one ending in an ambulance ride, ER visit, hospital stay, and once an intubation w/overnight stay in PICU after almost losing him.  Neurologists told me \"stop the fevers, the seizures will stop\".  Infectious Disease at CHKD couldn\\'t find anything.  Immunologists couldn\\'t find anything.  No one knew where these fevers (sometimes up to 105.3) were coming from.  We have to keep my son on Valium when his temp hits 100 to try to prevent a seizure, and we have a rectal syringe of a large dose of Valium when he has a seizure.  I usually can\\'t tell he\\'s fever is spiking until he starts seizing.  We had to switch daycares (thinking he was having an allergic reaction to something there), I went on FMLA for 3 weeks to care for him without pay, meanwhile medical bills rolling in like a flood.\\n\\nThen this afternoon I get the call that it is PFAPA and that he has puss pockets in his tonsils.  A simple tonsillectomy will take care of it.  Forgive me for sounding paranoid or suspicious, but I\\'m scared that this won\\'t be the end of it.\\n\\nI\\'m reading of all your posts with your children having fever spikes for numerous years, which, although bothersome and very frightening, is really more of a nuisance than anything.  My son\\'s fever spikes land him in an Emergency Room with vitals at 60%, struggling to breath, twitching like a fish on a stretcher.  I can\\'t stand this anymore.  We have continually watched doctor after doctor tell us they know nothing, meanwhile knowing that at any moment I can walk into his room and see his crib shaking.  I check his temperature AT LEAST 4 times every night while he sleeps.  We now have him in a daycare for special needs children because he needs special care to make sure they keep tabs on his temp, which costs twice as much as normal daycares.\\n\\nANYONE have ANY ideas?  Anyone have a child that\\'s had a combination of PFAPA and febrile seizures?  My baby is only 18 months old and we just want him to live a normal life for once and possibly make it an entire month without a seizure.\\n\\nI would not encourage you to rule out Pfapa. But I\\'m an 18 yr old who battled pfapa for many years.  My symptoms were always consistent.  I had fevers on such a schedule that my family planned our vacations around the days they knew I would be sick.  The time in between my episodes was always 3 weeks.  During those 3 weeks, I was very weak and caught other things more easily, but there wasn\\'t any sign of my pfapa.  Maybe your son has a different type of pfapa though?  My best friend suffers severe similar symptoms with Crohns?  Have they checked for Crohns?  My prayers are with him and you!  If I can help in any way please let me know...\\nTry the chiropractor...I\\'ve been taking my 8 year old and the episodes have been drastically reduced.  I have also cleaned up his diet--more calcium/mag, fish oil, and organic dairy (also taking homeopathic remedies).  Have your chiropractor adjust the C1 vertebrate--apparently when this is out of alignment it can cause systemic inflammation.  I\\'ve seen every specialist you can imagine.  Seeing how this approach works before  ENT does surgery.  Hope this helps.\\nYes, my son had a full blown seizure during an episode.  THis is how my investigative journey began into this syndrome.  After many specialists and doctors the only solution seems to be an tonsillectomy/adnoidectomy.  However, I am trying one last therapy before I resort to that.  I have been taking my son to a chiropractor after I received an email from another parent whose child has PFAPA.  Apparently when the C1 vertebrate is out of alignment, it can cause systemic inflammation and cause all sorts of reactions.  I am also consulting with a naturopathic Dr. who is also giving him some natural rememdies to help boost his immune system.  Since I\\'ve been doing this, his episodes are growing farther apart and less severe--very mild now.  He is also taking supplements and fish oil.  I know how scary this can be!  I can only imagine dealing with a baby with this I really feel for you.  Hang in there!\\nYour story is much like our own with our son.  (he is nearly 3 now.)  First febrile seizure was when he was 17 months old.  105 + fever.  For the next 8 months he had 12+ 105+ fevers, 4 that caused grand mal febrile seizures-all 4 needed ambulance rides.  2nd seizure almost cost him his life, due to aspiration during seizure-went into respiratory arrest, only with him, they couldn\\'t intubate, even though they were desperately trying to because of the continuing seizure.  It was the scariest, most heart lurching moment of our lives.  He ended up in ICU for three days after that...and all together in the hospital 10 days. (he got \"aspiration pneumonia\")  When we got to the ER, and all the docs/staff were running around doing their thing, they sent the hospital chaplain in to talk to us. We were in a shock like state.  I can sooooooooooooo relate to what you are going thru and my heart breaks as the memories are still so vivid of what life was like during that time.\\n\\nLong story short (lots of doc visits, tests etc...) we ended up with a PFAPA diagnosis when he was 2 years old.  We opted for the tonsil/adenoid surgery ASAP.  For him, PFAPA was life threatening due to his febrile seizures (they were considered \"complex\" seizures)  He had been hospitalized two times for complications from aspirating during the seizures, and we couldn\\'t take it anymore.  The tonsil surgery was 10 months ago.  He hasn\\'t had a single episode since then.  He popped up with a fever though, about 2 days ago...it was eerily familiar because it got up to 104 and he just seemed to have similar symptoms as before (minus the seizure).  Sore throat, swollen glands and pretty lethargic.  But Im not going to be too concerned since his brother just got over a virus last week with similar symptoms and Motrin takes the fever right down. (whereas when he had PFAPA episodes before surgery, we could not get the fever down with over the counter meds.)  The tonsil surgery was the best decision we could of made and we have no regrets.  Even if PFAPA comes back...(and from what I hear, if it does, it may be more mild) it was still worth it.\\n\\nAnd just FYI for people considering immunization as a cause...my son isn\\'t immunized.\\nI was constantly worried about our daughter getting seizures as well. Her fevers got as high as 106.3 without ever getting a seizure. Like you however, we spent many a night in the ER and were often admitted. My daughter\\'s fevers were cyclical. The occured within two days of the 15th every month. Our doctor informed us that the Child\\'s response to the fevers was hereditary. Some families are just much more likely to get seizures with their high fevers. One thing that did help my daughter was to give her IV antibiotics as soon as the fever started. Eventually we started keeping her on oral antibiotics which did seem to help. Finally in January of 2009, when she was three and after two years of fevers she had an adenotonsillectomy. She had not had a single fever since. We are very grateful that she is now cured. Make sure that your doctors rule out all genetic fever disoders and Crohns disease. Best of luck to you.\\nI know a lot of you are saying that the surgery is the \"last resort\", but in all honesty it is the ONLY resort.  It\\'s the Four Seasons resort!!!!  It\\'s not even that bad of a surgery or recovery time.  Yes, your child will have to eat ice cream and popsicles for a few days (they love it!), and the anesthesia part is scary, BUT i, etc!!!!!t is SO WORTH IT!!!!  I swore that once my son was better I would always come back to this thread and post advice and our story.  I cannot stress enough how important it is to get the surgery!!!!  Your lives will be forever changed.\\nI know what you are going true my daugther started with her problems at 2 years she isactually 4 andstill is undiagnose she sees reumathologist,gastroenterologist and neurologist they still dont knowwhat is the best treatment for her they are pretty sure is fmf or mediterranean fever but not sure yet .I know it is very frustrating not to knowwhat to do but dont lose hope and keep taking her to every place your pediatrician refear you okkk. lots of luck Josie\\nWell, to update everyone, we had Matthew\\'s appointment with the Immunologist/Allergist/Metabolic/Genetic doctor (yes, she does all of that).  Drove 2 hours to the appointment and paid (yet another) co-pay for her to say she wants to wait before doing the tonsillectomy.  Says she\\'s not sure that\\'s what it is because his appetite doesn\\'t stop when he has an episode.  My son eats at least twice as much as typical toddlers.  I don\\'t think anything will ever make him STOP eating.  It surprised me that she was so willing to dismiss this simply due to that.\\n\\nThen she tells us she wants to wait for him to have another seizure to get blood work done while he\\'s having an episode.\\nARE YOU SERIOUS???  I understand that she\\'s looking at this from a doctor/scientific standpoint (there\\'s some research being done and she wants him a part of an NIH study a few hours away), but I\\'m looking at it from a mother\\'s standpoint and I don\\'t want to see my baby have another grand-mal seizure before someone does something!  Screw her research.  Even if getting his tonsils out only has a 25% chance of working (not what she said, I\\'m just throwing a number out there), considering the minor side-effects and risks involved for a very minor/basic surgery, I think it\\'s well worth the risk to try!\\n\\nWe have an appointment this Friday with his normal pediatrician to see if she\\'ll set us up with a tonsillectomy (considering SHE was the one to suggest that to begin with).  Meanwhile, his 3-week mark is coming up on the 26th and I want those things out before that happens and I have to watch him suffer through another horrific seizure.\\n\\nI\\'ll keep you updated.\\n*****beksmith*****\\n\\nThank you for your feedback.  It\\'s nice to know my son is not the only one to go through having not only complex febrile seizures, but also repeated unexplained fever spikes, numerous hospital stays with ICU/intubation/etc and survive.  I\\'ve never been so scared in my life as I was February 27th when we almost lost him.  Please keep reading my posts on this and I\\'ll keep you updated as to his status.  I would love to speak with you more on this if you don\\'t mind.  We are so frustrated and helpless, it\\'s nice to talk to someone who can relate to your situation and can help guide you more than the doctors can.\\nI will keep myself updated on your situation and feel free to ask me anything...I really do understand.  I hear your desperation after your recent appointment with the immunologist/allergist etc..doc.  I would feel the exact same way!  We lived in a different state before getting an official diagnosis, and were getting such a run-a-round, and was about to be referred to a rheumatologist.  We had to move out of state and that sort of put everything on hold for a month.  So I did research/calls etc..during our move to find out the best physicians in the area we were moving to.  (thankfully it was to a much bigger city with a lot better healthcare)  In the meantime, I took my son\\'s temp every day probably 5 or more times a day, and had Motrin, Tylenol, thermometers (three different kinds to get accurate reading) and his seizure kits-emergency meds in case of seizure.  But before he could even get in to see his new pediatrician, he ended up having another episode, and ambulance ride.  At least this got the ball rolling for his healthcare in our new place of residence.  (had to look at the positive side.)  I was the one that actually started finding out info online about PFAPA.  I brought all my son\\'s records to the new pediatrician (who came highly recommended...she specializes in kids with special needs, or special medical needs), and also brought along a bunch of printed off info about PFAPA.  She ended up meeting with a couple other doctors, pouring over his medical records from previous doctors, and going over medical journals about PFAPA and other cyclic fever syndromes.  They did some blood work, and a trial with prednisone (which stopped the episode within hours of starting..)  between blood tests that ruled out other things, and the test run with prednisone, they determined that he did have PFAPA, and officially gave him this diagnosis.  They asked me if I wanted to see rheumatology for treatment before going to ENT for tonsil consult.  I said \"nope\"  that I wanted those tonsils out ASAP.  I had read enough info online to confirm that the surgery was worth the risk...especially in his case since the PFAPA was much more than just a nuisance...but life threatening (as mentioned before).  The ped called around to see if she could find an ENT doc familiar wit PFAPA...and on her first call, the doc finished her sentence for her when she said \"i have this patient with fevers every 28-35 days...\"  he said \"oh PFAPA\".  He\\'d done tonsils/adenoids on a handful of patients with the disease and to his knowledge they had all been successful at stopping the episodes.  So he squeezed us in, and the rest of the story is that he ended up having surgery, and we are soooo thankful.  It helps if the ENT doc is familiar with PFAPA and how it works...not all are.  Hopefully you can have your ped look around and find one for you.?  I think this waiting for another seizure to happen plan stinks.  I would be like you and move on to getting  more appropriate care.  We saw neurology before this, and he said \"stop the fevers and you stop the seizures\" too.  He said it wasn\\'t even truly a neurological condition, but whatever was causing the fevers...that was the route we needed to take.\\n\\nUgh...I feel your anguish in all this.  I hope you are able to get the perfect solution for your little one, and fast...\\n28-35 days...... wow.  I just looked at the calendar and Matty went 18, 25, 34, 20 days between episodes.  I just don\\'t understand why no one saw this before.  I know this PFAPA is rare, but shouldn\\'t SOMEONE have picked up on a connection?  Initially it was \"must be a virus, give it a week\", then after a week it was \"must be bacterial, here\\'s some antibiotics\", then after a 10 day dose, it was \"must not be reacting to antibiotics, here\\'s a different antibiotic\".  Meanwhile, everytime you go to the ER there are different doctors, each one saying \"must be a virus, he\\'ll get over it\" and we\\'re screaming \"IT\\'S NOT A ***** VIRUS!!!!\"  but since we\\'re the parents and not medical people, we MUST not know what we\\'re talking about.\\n\\nOn another note, we\\'re in the middle of a bankruptcy (and since we filed February 7th - BEFORE all this started we can\\'t add these medical bills), so we have very limited funds right now.  We\\'ve both taken so much time off work to care for Matt we\\'re under threat of losing our jobs.  I had to go on FMLA to prevent getting fired, which meant 3 weeks of no income.  And every doctor\\'s appointment there\\'s another co-pay for them to tell me they have no clue what\\'s wrong.\\n\\nI guess I\\'m just so frustrated with these doctors sticking him with needles, doing more and more blood work with no answers, taking x-rays, EEGs, MRIs, etc and then releasing him from the hospital with still no answers, KNOWING we\\'re gonna be back within a month with the same thing.\\n\\nI have a \"medical bag\" along with the diaper bag for him now that goes everywhere he goes.  It has liquid tylenol, liquid motrin, tylenol suppositories, oral diazepam, rectal diastat, rectal thermometer and ear thermometer.  So far every seizure he\\'s had, I\\'ve been right there to care for him.  But I know one of these days he\\'ll do it at daycare, or in the car, or somewhere I can\\'t get him the diastat immediately and we\\'ll have another incident like his first one when he got aspiration and almost died.  I don\\'t want to sit back and just wait for that day to come.  It\\'s hard to describe to people (family and such) what it\\'s like to watch your baby go through such a tramatic experience.  To hold them, trying to calm them down (without your body temperature raising theirs even higher), knowing there\\'s nothing you can do to bring them \"out of it\".  Every square inch of their body twitching in a rhythmic display of chaos.  Holding their tight little balled up shaking fists, wondering if they can even feel you there.  It\\'s something I wouldn\\'t wish on my worst enemy.\\n\\nI\\'ve decided to contact the ENT that did his tubes in his ears (through all this he got an ear infection and we opted to go with tubes - anything to prevent future fevers) and see if he would be willing to do the tonsillectomy.  I\\'ll just go around these doctors if I have to and get things done myself.  Hopefully I\\'ll be coming back on this site many times raving at how wonderful it is that my baby is \"cured\" and helping others that are in my position now.\\n\\nI\\'ll keep you updated.    ------and\\n------\\n\\n\\n\\nOur pediatrician (has no experience with PFAPA) is wanting to wait for Matthew to have another episode before doing tonsillectomy.  She wants to see if the Orapred works at bringing down and holding down his fever.\\n\\nSo last night his fever crept up to 100.8 so I went ahead and gave it to him.  Sure enough, it brought it down and hasn\\'t been back up since.  (Little reminder, Matt also has febrile seizures, so fever spikes in him can be deadly).  I called the pediatrician this morning to tell them the news and let\\'s go forward with surgery like they said they would.  Their response is, \"he\\'s fever didn\\'t reach 101 and that\\'s the point we need\".  SERIOUSLY???  They are refusing to do the tonsillectomy since they still don\\'t have an absolute positive diagnosis of PFAPA since his fever was only 100.8 when I gave it to him instead of 101.  We now have to wait another 3-4 weeks for it to happen again.  Next time I might not get to it in time and he might have another seizure that lands him in PICU like he\\'s done before.  I\\'m not willing to take that chance!!!\\n\\nDOES ANYONE HAVE THE NAME OF YOUR DOCTOR THAT DIAGNOSED PFAPA AND DID SURGERY\\n???\\n\\nI\\'ll drive him anywhere to get this done IMMEDIATELY.  We are in the Virginia Beach, VA area, so if anyone is on the east coast, it would be preferred.  I\\'m desperate to get his tonsils out ASAP so anything is helpful.\\n\\nTHANKS!!!!\\nJenna,\\n\\nAfter we moved to Phoenix, and I started reading info online about PFAPA, I read a very moving article written by an ENT doctor in Boston who\\'s own daughter had the mysterious, cyclic fevers and he ended up finding out about PFAPA thru his own research and had her tonsils out.  He now is well known all over the country for his work/research and treatment of PFAPA.  I called his office and talked with his assistant about flying out to Boston to see him for consult and eventually surgery.  They said they have people come from all over the country.  But they also try to keep up to date on what area\\'s have doctors that are starting to treat it and are familiar with it.  We ended up finding an ENT doc here that was familiar and did the surgery, but we would of taken our son to Boston if need be.\\n\\nWe are in Phoenix, AZ and the doc we saw (awesome doc!!!  Just did my other son\\'s tonsils for a different reason)  is Dr. John Raines.  But Boston would be much closer to you, and that doc is ground breaking in treating PFAPA.\\nI too contacted Dr. Licamelli in Boston. In fact, it was his research that convinced my doctor that my daughter could have PFAPA. Boston Children\\'s Hospital is world renowned for it\\'s research. There was no way to know for sure if she had it but we did the surgery and it worked!  My doctors are all in Las Vegas, but if you are interested I can post their info.',\n",

He can be very sweet one minute, then in a total rage the next.\\n\\nI guess I\\'m not so much looking for a diagnosis, or an answer to a question...yet, looking for parents who go through this kind of stuff with their child.

I actually DREAD the daily struggles... because it\\'s so hard for me and my family and the other kids....\\n\\nPlease, if you know of anything that you\\'ve personally done to help your \\'moody child\\' let me know\\n\\nMy child was like that.  She is almost 15 now and has been diagnosed with a mood disorder, Asperger\\'s and ADHD.  As your little boy is so young, I would suggest you begin doing some reading on biomedical treatment of mood disorders and even autism spectrum disorders (as I suspect that may be happening, too, since you mentioned the sensory and language issues).  Sometimes dietary changes and a few supplements can be life changing and the younger you start, the better.\\n\\nFeel free to PM me.  I\\'m happy to help.\\nI am going through something similar. Nothing aids when my (2 year old) son is in his \"mood.\" My other 2 children (age 8 and 3) are starting to really yell and sometimes hit him and are acting out because their brother is taking so much time away from their fun. I totally get it!! My son too has been like this since birth. Nothing ever really calmed him down. He has always been so hot or cold I can\\'t remember him just \"relaxing\" and chilling out.\\n\\nMy question to you is how did you get him into somewhere regarding his behavior? I really feel this is something different then like your other children and no one believes you! When my sister actually experienced it full on she couldn\\'t believe it! My son is getting speech therapy but they don\\'t offer anything in regards to behavior stuff and don\\'t offer any other services. My pediatrician doesn\\'t seem to get it either. My son is not thriving as much as he should and I do beleive it is due to his behavioral issues. His height is on the 10% tile and weight is below as well. My other son was on the 90th at his age for both and my daughter is average. How did you get a diagnosis? Do I take him myself to a psychologist? Do I wait til he is 3?

       " {'post': 'Hi all, sorry this may be long. My daughter is nearly 11, she has always been quirkybut over the last few years I\\'ve wondered if there\\'s more to it. A couple of years ago she started displaying tics, vocal and motor, at one point they were significant then only mild. Now virtually gone. She has a lot of strange behaviours I will list here. If anyone could help me with what it all means I would be very grateful.\\nShe has echolalia. Repeating phrases from t.v and people.\\nShe has no real self awareness.\\nNo real emotional attachments besides me.\\nGets frustrated quickly if she can\\'t be understood or doesn\\'t understand ie. if I\\'m helping her with homework.\\nShe won\\'t wear buttons, not that she doesn\\'t like them but \\'someone might see me wearing them\\'\\nGoes mad and has to leave the room if someone is chewing food loudly\\nI won\\'t say obsessed but food/sweets mad. Associates a lot of times with food. Eg. Oh, I remember her, she had a jam sandwich.\\nComes home from school and sometimes just shouts out random phrase or noise as if she\\'s been holding it in\\nDoesn\\'t get sarcasm or detailed jokes, but fine with knock knock.\\nAsks pointless random questions\\nVery immature, doesn\\'t see to have changed since at least 8, can\\'t really remember before that.\\nShe has been like this def a few years, maybe longer but because of age it\\'s not really been noticeable or a worry.\\nShe goes to comp in sept. and I\\'m worried that as her peers progress she will stay where she is.\\nAcademically she is fine average or above. She has friends. Socially seems fine apart from saying random things occasionally. School has no concerns. She definitely acts differently around family etc. but in school is contained.\\nI have asked for a referral from docs, but if it comes back no, do I fight for her or hope she grows out of it?\\nIf anyone has any idea what could be wrong I would love to hear what you think.\\nThanks\\nI have a 10 year old with autism and a 12 year old with asperger\\'s, and in your description I would say she has several characteristics of asperger\\'s.  If she is functioning ok and has no behavioral concerns, chances are she will be just fine.  Heck, Bill Gates has aspergers!!\\n\\nWhat I would do is find a good developmental pediatrician or a neurologist and ask for a comprehensive evaluation.\\nHi Florida, she is functioning fine and doing well at school. If you met her you wouldn\\'t think she had any of the problems I\\'ve described. Apparently girls are much better at hiding their traits. My major concern is her peers will start to notice she is different as they all mature as she seems stuck at about age 8! I just think if I have some help in place in case she struggles, that\\'s all I can do for now.\\nThanks for your reply, I think from all the responses I\\'ve had from here and other forums, it sounds like she may have aspergers, as one mum said of her daughter \\'lightly touched with aspergers\\'\\nYou must have your hands full!\\nEmma x\\nA lot of these quirky behaviors can be put down to Sensory Integration Disorder or Dysfunction.\\n\\nSometimes this condition is misdiagnosed as autism and vice versa since sensory issues can be part of autism. Have her hearing checked too. There can be special problems associated with the nerves of the ears that are more with processing sound rather than level of sound heard.\\n\\nWith sensory issues, whatever is bothering the child, like noise, chewing, buttons, the feel of certain fabrics or food...have to be dealt with in a special way!\\n\\nA sensory person must learn to deal with it thru desensitization therapy. And once that is done that particular problem should go away.\\n\\nMy GS has sensory issues and used to be annoyed at loud sounds. He also did not want to hold his bottle or sippy cup because the feel of smooth things bothered him. Probably because he felt like he would drop it. But cardboard juice boxes were fine!\\n\\nhe has always been in some kind of therapy or gym class until age 5. At that time, he started kindergarten and that was a form of therapy for him. He is now is regular grade and is well liked but he is still a little shy. He is ten now. There are doctors who specialize in sensory issues, do a search for your area and you will find someone.\\n\\nMy gs is very deficient in the B vitamins and must have the Bs twice a day. He cannot store them in his liver. This can lead to a lot of problems.\\n\\nYOUr child could benefit from therapy to address the repetetive behaviors and some of the other things which will set her apart from her peers.\\nLike the buttons issue and such. Can\\'t remember everything you wrote.\\n\\nAgain, growing older and being with \"typical\" children is so helpful. By the time she is 18 you will think she is merely quirky I\\'ll bet.\\nThanks golf hat, it\\'s certainly worth looking at all angles. The only thing I would say though is she doesn\\'t dislike buttons as such in her words \"someone might see me wearing them\". Also, apart from not liking other people chewing loudly I can\\'t think of any other sensory issues, but, she has had hearing problems in the past due to many ear infections when she was very young so I\\'ll google sensory issues and see if it rings any bells.

She gets therapy twice a week and has slowly been getting better with her grades, concentration and boundaries .....\\nHowever at home she talks excessively, is very hyperactive in her being and doing. Now she is also getting to that age of talking back and other usual teenage stuff.\\nHer real dad has no visitation rights and has not seen her since she was 4. Stepdad has been in her life ever since, he is a good dad and we now have 2 more kids.\\nHe accepted her at first and now hates her and says so....he does not believe she will ever become anything in her life and can\\'t stand that she is just like her real dad ( who he knew) he threatens me that he will leave all of us because of her. He does not want to put anymore energy in her!! I am always in the middle of things trying to make this work....he admits that he is mean to her and just can\\'t handle it. I think he is being selfish and childish. How come I can look at her like a person and he always sees my ex?\\nThere is always more to the story, but any advice is welcome.\\nShould I put my daughter on meds ? How can I make stepdad change his attitude? My daughter really is trying to change but there are still issues she must address herself.....\\nReading this makes me angry and brings back so many unpleasant memories for me...\\n\\nMy middle daughter was bi-polar and had ADD.  It was a challenge, many heartaches and ups and downs.  She was on meds for a while and did counseling...the whole nine yards.  The cool thing is that she and her husband have a beautiful family, are expecting a baby, have decent jobs, are hard working, are wonderful parents and have a good life.  So, she turned out fine.  She had to learn some things the hard way and she put me through some hellish things on occasion.  She is still bi-polar and still has ADD, but she has learned how to deal with these things to become an upstanding member of society.\\n\\nYour daughter is 11.  She is still a child.  Your husband is acting like a child and needs to grow up.  I think family counseling would be in order here.  I don\\'t think I would classify him as a good dad if he is openly expressing his hatred for her, especially if he is saying it in front of her and \"being mean\" to her.  That is abusive behavior.  He is going to cause more problems for her to overcome and he is supposed to be an adult.  I would rather see him walk out the door than to see him destroy your daughter by treating her like the \"ugly step daughter.\"\\n\\nUnfortunately, you can\\'t make him do anything or change his attitude.  He has to do that on his own.  Counseling can make a difference if he is willing to attend and willing to make changes in his behaviors and attitudes.  How would he feel if one of his own children were treated the way he treats her? Does he want to be treated that way?\\n\\nThe man to whom I was married when my daughter had the most problems caused more damage for her to overcome.  It was a similar attitude.  He was just downright hateful to her.  I didn\\'t stay with him, however, the damage was done.  It was overcome, but it didn\\'t have to be that way and I regret that I didn\\'t leave him sooner.\\n\\nMedications are good sometimes as long as you start out small and gradually increase until you find what gives your daughter a good balance.  Just enough to help her, but no more. She will still be hyper and talkative, but that\\'s ok.  You just want enough to take the edge off.  As she learns to deal with the ADHD, she can gradually step down and eventually, possibly deal with it on her own without meds.',\n",

       " {'post': \"Background info...\\n\\nDD was 18 mo. when we started OT for her.  at age 3-4 she was diagnosed with Sensory Processing Disorder.  at age 4-5 she was diagnosed with ADHD, but not Autism.  She was receiving OT up to age 5, when she met her goals, insurance wouldn't cover anymore.  She was seeing a psych grad student for behavioral modifications for her ADHD up until last summer, where she met her goals, and was no longer receiving services.\\n\\nI just finished an IEP meeting today for our DD who is currently in 1st grade.  We had and IEP done b/c she was falling behind in class.  Right now she's attending a private Christian school.  We initially put her here b/c of her SPD (sensory processing disorder), she had potty training problems, and we felt, a smaller school was better for her.  With a public school, she was able to get an IEP done and qualified for services b/c of her ADHD.  I have to decide wether or not to switch her over.\\n\\nThe speech therapist, kindly suggested that I look into medication for her ADHD.  We (the parents) felt .she would be ok, with the behavioral therapy.  It seems her ADHD is really affecting her concentration, or lack there of at school.  but her SPD is also causing her to be a distraction and bothersome to the other students.\\n\\nI'm currently looking for a child psych specialist in aspergers to get her tested as well.\\n\\nI was trying to find some information on medications for ADHD.  I've been reading responses of adverse affects people have been having.  She is a very sweet and loving girl, and I would hate to see that disappear.\\n\\nIf she does get medicated, it might help her concentrate better in school and I can keep her in private, but she would still beable to receive more services if I move her to public.\\n\\nTHIA for you inputs.\\nfrom personal experience, your daughter would possibly do better if she was in a smaller class, that way, she could get one on one time with the teacher. If that happens she would be able to get more help on how to learn to deal with her condition. I know this because my brother has exactly what your daughter has and when he was placed in a smaller class setting. I hope this helps.\\nSchools to me seem a little too eager to rush children into taking heavy duty prescription meds for ADHD. Usually because the teacher can't take having a child in class that is disruptive in any way, shape or form. I would either take her out and homeschool her, and send her only for therapies, or find a teacher willing to work with her the way she is, her sweet loving active little self. Children should be allowed to express their true selves. The only time I feel meds are needed for a child are if they are a danger to themselves or others, or they are sick with a raging disease.\\n\\nI have friends with children with both ADHD and Aspergers and they have seemed to use a variety of methods over the years. They seem to become the therapist for their child. You will learn what works and doesn't work for your child, but above all you must protect her from well meaning people.\\n\\nI don't know about your state, but in mine, therapies can be paid for by the state if a doctor says they need therapy. In which case, its often through the public school system. There may be private therapists available in your town also, or through the local hospitals, although it may take more work with the insurance companies. Even if you homeschool her, she still should qualify for services through the school district. My friends have homeschooled their kids off and on through the years, and its not for everyone, but for some it has been a life saver. There are online schools also that in our state are paid for by funding from your local school district. You can still offer a disciplined environment at home so they learn structure, while allowing them more leeway for their creative side to shine through.\\nBasically an IEP just says what goals they will work on with your child and how they will do so. This summer, maybe you could learn how to make your own goals for your child- then implement those goals. For ex: She will learn to go potty on her potty chair at least 50% of the time. We will do this by: putting her on the potty every half hour for 10 minutes at a time. If there is a sensory issue involved in using the potty, then adapt the potty to her needs. (The seat is too hard, too soft, etc.) Then put that on your goal sheet as well.\\nAlso your school district is mandated to provide free of charge testing each year to know where your child is at with no obligation for you to attend their school. So you have options. If you decide to keep her in public school, you may find a teacher that is willing to be flexible so you don't have to medicate your child. I hope you do! Just so you know you have many options available to you, but whatever you decide, you will need to learn to be the main teacher of your child, because you know her better than anyone, and for her to have success, you will have to be involved in the process.\\nBest wishes, K.\\nTry GAPS diet (Gut And Psychology Syndrome). It works miracles for behaviors and symptoms.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'My son is nearly 7 and up to now has been very verbal and social.  He is very bright and articulate.  In the last couple of months, he has been repeating himself to the point where he tries a sentence over and over again until he finally gets it out.  There are times (like at bedtime) when he is compelled to say an exact statement and repeats it over and over again until he gets it right.  There are times when he is very \"normal\" and then he slips back into the repeating.\\n\\nThis week, the problem has gone into overdrive - we think it might be due to the end of school and start of day camp.  Sometimes, he starts speaking and then stops and taps a number of times until he continues on.  He has always talked a lot and he still does - it\\'s just harder for him to spit it out.  He is a very social kid who has no problem talking to anyone, anywhere.\\n\\nWe are trying lots of techniques to try to get him back to his old self, but nothing seems to work.\\nMy grandson used to repeat back things that WE would say. It drove us crazy. Because he was mocking us. I never knew if it was a real issue or he was just being funny. He thought it was funny.\\n\\nWell, maybe the first time it was funny, but it wasn\\'t funny after awhile. he is 10 now and no longer does that much.\\nBut I can\\'t recall him repeating his OWN sentences. Ones that he himself thought up but it is probably all linked into the same disorder.\\n\\nMY gs has mild sensory issues which have lessened over time. He used to be on the spectrum but it is now so mild you would not know--- except he is still shy with a lot of people he doesnt know well.\\n\\nDoes your child have any other issues besides this? Sometimes therapy is very helpful and the school can provide that. One thing my gs did was go to an afterschool club for kids to learn how to behave properly with other people.\\n\\n\"Typical kids\" ran it along with teachers. The typical children would perform and the atypical or shy children would imitate the proper behavior. Believe me this was such a help.\\n\\nAfter awhile my gs moved closer to being typical and no longer benefited from the club.\\nFrankly, I don\\'t think you have a lot to be concerned about, but explain to him that it is not acceptable to do that in front of others. HOWEVER, sometimes kids still need that outlet of repetetive behavior in order to calm down anxiety.\\n\\nMy nephew 19--who is not on the spectrum and was 8th in his hs class, used to repeat instructions to himself!!\\n\\nWhen he was scolded and told what not to do or what to do, my mother (his grandmother) told me she would catch him repeating things she had said to him--- to himself. As if he wanted to be sure he didn\\'t do it again! She thought it was strange, but he was never on the spectrum.\\n\\nSo don\\'t worry too much but mention it to his doc or his teacher.\\nGreetings Emily and welcome to healthboards!\\nI am not sayig this is the problem and of course the professionals are the ones a person can consult. I found out that sometimes a strep\\ninfection can cause symptoms like that.\\nUnfortunately sometimes even antibiotics or heat does not destroy germs.\\n\\nStrengthening the body is usually useful with a good healthy lifestyle. I would eat more grapefruit, kiwi, lemon, lime, and drink raw garlic water 3 times a day for 2 weeks if possible. The garlic can be put in water and blended and then strained out. If it seems difficult this way perhaps it can be minced and put in homemade salad dressing or in mix in the food in other ways. I would not use sugar or sweetening of any type since germs love sugar. Of course everyone makes their own health care decisions in life and does what they think is needed. My sympathies for this. Peace, sjb\\nMY younger brother who is 4 years of age also faces the same problem. And his situation also varies. Something this repeating problem comes to stage of normality while sometimes it just goes overboard.\\nmy son\\'s pediatrician is treating him for PANDAS and the antibiotics seem to be working.  There is lots of information on PANDAS if you google it.  Has your brother been exposed to Strep at all?  Our son never had any strep infection that we knew about, but it was in the community this spring, so it makes sense.',\n",

I would highly recommend a developmental assessment.\\n\\nGood luck\\nHi:\\n\\nI\\'m sorry you are having problems with your daughter. I know this is hard, but try to just observe her, that way when you go to a doctor you can answer their questions. It sounds like Autism, but needs to be diagnosed by a professional. Have you taken her to her pediatrician? They have an Autism screening form that you can fill out, then if it appears to be that, they can make a referral to a specialist. In the meantime, try to find an Autism support group in your area, the parents might be able to give you a lot of insights into how she might be feeling, or how to deal with her. If she\\'s not Autistic, great! But you still would have the support of other people to help you to deal with her issues. These parents are the ones who have been through it all and can maybe give you some ideas.\\nAs far as potty training, maybe put that on the back burner till you figure out what is going on, that\\'s not something you can control.\\n\\nBest wishes with your little one,\\nK.\\nHi:\\n\\nWow what a shame, should be such a fun time for you and her right now. I agree with the other posters, she does appear to have some of the traits found on the Autistic spectrum and a development assessment would work wonders.  Can I ask you some questions: has the family experienced some kind of dramatic event lately like a death in the family, a stressful move, or has she been terrible sick?? If answer is no to all these questions, then please call and make appointment with occupational therapist in the community, so she can be tested.\\nSounds like it could be something like aspergers or something on the autism spectrum disorder.    Definitely try to intervene early.   There are programs that can be made available to her to give her therapy to try to keep her on grade level, but they have to start early.    Many kids do very well with the right interventions, and it could definitely make your life easier.',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi everyone, I am about at my wit\\'s end with my 8 year old son\\'s bad behavior! He has always been \"shy\" and quiet. He talked and interacted fine at home, but at preschool and kindergarten he would not talk to anyone. He just glared at people when they talked to him and got upset if they persisted with questions. He would point fingers at them and glare at them until they just left him alone, probably thinking \\'what a brat!\\' Since then, he won\\'t answer people when they speak to him. He doesn\\'t really glare at people anymore, he just won\\'t look anybody in the face, he looks away off to the side or at something else when they talk to him. He is mean to other kids at school. He has a few friends there, but mostly is mean to others. He is very smart and has great grades at school, but the constant concern is this issue with every teacher he has ever had. He even does this to me sometimes. At home, one on one, he could be fine one moment, and then start doing this for no reason the next. He is so hateful! And I don\\'t understand why. We are not abusive or even remotely mean to him, but we don\\'t spoil him either. I have taken him to 2 separate child psychologists for evaluation for behavioral disorders or something, don\\'t know exactly what I was looking for, just some sort of answer or suggestion or something! They both said that they don\\'t see anything wrong with him. I don\\'t know what to do! Today we had a great morning, nothing bad happened between us or anything, then this afternoon when I picked him up from school I said \"Hi, how was your day?\" and he glared at me and said \"Fine until you got here!\". I have him in his room for his bad attitude for the afternoon. I just don\\'t know what to do anymore. I have tried time-outs, positive reinforcement, behavior charts, spanking, even reasoning with him which I didn\\'t expect would work, I just don\\'t know. Any thoughts or suggestions? He can be so lovable at times, but then just is mean at other times. I never know what to expect.....thanks\\nI\\'ve got an 11 year old son with behavior problems (including ADHD, ODD, & Bipolar) so I feel your pain. The best thing that we did with our son was have him evaluated for special education by the public school district. They will review your child\\'s medical history, interview teachers, interview parents, as well as conduct extensive interviews and observations of him. It was far more thorough than anything any of my son\\'s doctors and psychologists had done. My son opened up to them more than he did anyone else and we learned that he had a lot more problems with self esteem and anxiety than anyone had realized. His individual education program includes an adaptive behavior course that teaches him how to interact with other people and keep better control of himself. Since getting that IEP set up, he has gone from an average of 3 days per week of in school suspension to once in 7 months.\\n\\nOne thing we did notice about our son was that he would act out on purpose because he actually liked the punishment in some cases. He preferred to be in his room, not bothered by his sister or having to deal with any of the rest of the family. He preferred to be in the ISS room at school because there were fewer kids to deal with.\\n\\nAlso, have they tested him for Asperger\\'s?\\nThanks for the response. At the first psychologist\\'s appointment, I enrolled him in a workshop for social anxiety in children. It was a group workshop, but also gave individual attention to each child enrolled. He actually enjoyed going, but it didn\\'t help him any. I did request at our most recent appointment with the psychologist that they test him for Asperger\\'s. The psychologist said that he did not exhibit enough characteristics of Asperger\\'s to warrant testing him. It was a little disappointing. What\\'s it going to hurt to test him? If he doesn\\'t have it, he doesn\\'t have it, but better to know definitively. They instead did an IQ test on him and told me that he has a very high IQ, and that he seems to have problems identifying with his peers. That all is fine, and makes sense, but he doesn\\'t just act out with his peers. He does it with adults, whether familiar or strangers, as well. I have not yet requested evaluation by the school district. It was offered to me when he was 6, when I confided in his teacher that I just didn\\'t know what to do and that I had tried everything under the sun to no avail, but I declined it at the time. :-(  That was when I started taking him to a private child psychologist, as I didn\\'t want him to undergo an IEP at school if it was unwarranted. I\\'m starting to just wish I had gone along with it in the first place and may have to request an IEP anyway.\\nHi, i think the psychologist should re-evaluate him for ODD and bipolar and go from there and see what they get. There could be a possibility for some kind of deep anger issue twards everyone as you have said. I hope my comments help and good luck.\\nThanks for the comment RANDOL. I did not know what ODD was so I looked it up. He does exhibit a lot of the characteristics of ODD at home at sometimes at school. The problem with his visits with his psychiatrists is that he is polite and listens and talks, sometimes reluctantly, but gives appropriate answers when he is questioned. I don\\'t know if something in the office just makes him feel comfortable, but I really feel like it is because these are one on one sessions, not a lot of people present, which is when acts out more. I feel like the psychiatrists are thinking there is something wrong with me for bringing him for evaluation when he is so well-behaved in their offices!\\nODD seems kind of scary to me and it appears to be something that needs to be explored as soon as it is expected, because once these kids get older they can end up getting in a lot of trouble for their actions.\\nIts not a problem, Ive seen ADHD,ODD and bipolar up close and personal and how tha actions are but doesnt make me an expert of corse lol. My nephew on my wife\\'s side has all of the classifacations and is not pleasent to be around at times when things go flying around the house and doesnt have respect for many people at all but ive seen it before and wish you luck with findind out what his issues are and where the anger comes from. Good luck\\nI am surprised that the psychologist said he didn\\'t exhibit the characteristics of Asbergers\\'s Syndrome.  Two of the main characteristics are high IQ and poor social interactions with peers and others.  Request the evaluation from your school district.  Be sure to post when you have some results.\\n\\nI agree with Rudiraven about the Asbergers,it can be a possible colprit.\\nI also agree with rudiraven.\\nThanks, all. I did a lot of research on Asperger\\'s before my son\\'s last appt, earlier this year. I printed out material, found a really good behavior checklist, filled it out, and brought it to the psychologist. I was very disappointed when he refused to test my son. He was in a one on one meeting with my son. That\\'s way different than a classroom setting, or other social occasion. My son was uncharacteristically not shy, answered all his questions, was polite, and even appeared to enjoy himself. So the psychologist just did not see what I was reporting. I even brought my mother with me, who watches him after school while I am at work, so she could corroborate my information.\\n\\nHe has an IEP meeting coming up at school. I think I will request an Asperger\\'s evaluation at that time. If he doesn\\'t have it, well then, I\\'m not anywhere worse than I am now. But I really do think that he exhibits a lot of those characteristics.\\n\\nAsperger\\'s would definitely be a more \\'desirable\\' diagnosis than ODD...in my opinion. I hope that doesn\\'t sound bad. I would love my son either way, but Asperger\\'s is mostly a problem with social situations/social anxiety/inabilities, not actual defiance/acting out.\\nmy mom had the same problem with my brother he acted the same way and she took him to see so many people and they all just said that he was a bad kid but when he was 11 one of his teachers referred him to a doctor and we finally found someone who finally knew what was goin on.  my brother was diagnosed with asbergers (not sure if this is how it is spelled) which is an autism spectrum disorder and he is 16 now doing great\\nDon\\'t give up.  Keep searching.  There is a program call Brain Balance that you might want to check out - not sure of all the locations.  It is expensive and time consuming (3x a week visits for an hour) but helped my son so much.  They also have financial aid available - not sure of the details.  What age is your child?  If school age, know your rights in order to gain the help needed within the classroom to help your child.  Don\\'t let anyone just write him off as \"bad\".  I\\'ve been there.\\nAlso, I never believed in the whole diet thing but it is something to consider...red food dye, sugar, etc.  It can seriously cause behavior problems.\\n\\nSounds like you need Behavior Specialists who deal with kids that are special needs.  Ask at school or at your local ARC program.  Or call Kennedy Kreiger Institute in Baltimore, maryland for some help!!\\nDid you ever ask your son when he was in the good mood why does he do this or does he notice how he changes?\\nYes and my son answers \"I don\\'t know mom\"...and you know what, I have come to realize that he really does not know.',\n",

I figured that it would just take a little time for them to regulate, since I was a late bloomer and all. This year though, I've had more periods, and they've seemed to be coming more often, anywhere between every 30-40 days. Until August. August 4th was the end of my last period, and at the end of August, I lost my virginity. I've been sexually active since then, and I've also not had a period. I've taken several pregnancy tests (which were negative), and I've even visited the doctor, who has confirmed that I am not pregnant. He prescribed a progestin (medroproxyr) for me to take for 10 days, which I thought was supposed to make me bleed, but did not, and he also put me on birth control pills. I've read that when a girl has sex for the first time, it could cause her to not have her period for up to 3 months, so I thought that that could have something to do with my period being so late. But, my doctor said that having sex does not affect your period unless you are pregnant. He suggested that I may have polycystic ovarian syndrome.\\n\\n\\nThe thought of having PCOS is frightening to me because I'm afraid that I may not be able to have children.

Or does losing your virginity really affect your menstruation? Any comments are greatly appreciated. Thanks~\\nWell, I dont know anything about PCOS but i do know that after I first lost my virginity my perioid was about a month late. before that i had pretty regular periods. i thought for sure that i was pregnant because i had never been that late....ever. but i took test after test and i wasnt. eventually i got my period and since then my periods have been pretty regular again. so....maybe it could just be that you had sex for the first time...i dont know. good luck though!\",\n",

My boobs also increased in size - they even hurt because they grew so quickly...and a few of my friends actually commented that they'd noticed my size increase (my boobs are still small, but at least they're visible now).

I know that is what my endocrinologist first tested for when I was diagnosed with PCOS a couple of years ago.  She wanted to rule that out.  If you are still having problems then please keep talking to your doctor so they can continue testing.  If that doctor will not help you then go to another.  Do not stop until you are satisfied.\\n\\nTerry\\nI started my period at 12 years old.  It has always been 7 - 14 days long.  I have it every month, sometimes every two weeks.  I have been on the pill since I was 15, that is 12 years now.  I have told doctors for years that something is wrong but no one would listen.  Then I went to this doc, got the internal and external exam done.  I had cysts on my ovaries.  I also have chronic pain in my stomach, and bleeding during sex.  I got all the blood work done and everything came out negative.  He still ruled that I had PCOS b/c of the cysts on my ovaries.  Along with that, he told me that I probably won't be able to have children but not to worry b/c of all the fertility meds out there.  Fast forward 2 years, I am going to a different doc.  I got the exams done again and I have NO cysts.  I recently had a biopsy done on my cervix and waiting for test results.  GO to a different doctor until you can figure out what is wrong.  Go to one that LISTENS to you and is not going to diagonse you with anything b/c some of the possibilities are there.  We KNOW what is going on with our own bodies and know that something is wrong.\\n\\nThis sums it up perfectly.  This is what you need to do.  We know when something is wrong with our body.  Even if they cannot find something in the beginning, they need to dig deeper.  Please keep trying and do not give up.\\n\\nTerry\\nHi Ashley.  I have PCOS and I have never had cysts.  I was diagnosed because my periods have never been regular and the ratio between two of my hormones was very high.  So as far as I know, you do not have to have cysts in order to have PCOS.  You may have to doctor shop until you can find one that will listen to you.  Good luck!\\nWhen I was initially had my ultrasound the tech said that I showed all the symptoms. She said the next step was to pass her findings to my GP and that it should take x amount of time. When I called after x amount of time I was told by the nurse who answered the phone that all my tests came back fine and that there was nothing wrong with me. My partner (a nurse himself) urged me to call and make a direct appointment with the GP who had initiated me being tested. When I went in to see him I was almost floored to find out that all my tests had come back confirming that I DO indeed have PCOS. Just one story to prove people do make mistakes. I would suggest getting a second opinion and asking to be retested to make sure. Thankfully my partner had the good sense to have me chase this up and I am now under treatment...\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi everyone\\nive posted this thread on here before a few months back, but some things have happened since then so am really looking for some advice and opinions.\\nIve been trying for a baby for around 9 months, since august last year (had a break of 5 months earlier this year). About a year ago i had some blood tests done and they showed that i wasnt ovulating. I was quite confused as i just assumed i would be. I asked my doctor why, and he just said that some women dont ovulate every month and that it was nothing to worry about, but that i might need something like clomid to kick start me into ovulating. In the meantime, he just told me to carry on trying.\\nAfter the break from trying, i started again in july, but still had no luck, so i just had more blood tests done last week, and they\\'ve showed that im still not ovulating.\\nIve heard that PCOS can be a cause of anovulatory cycles, and wondered if this is true? As i also heard somewhere else that you still ovulate with PCOS but that the ovaries are covered in cysts and the egg is released in a cyst, which is what causes the infertility instead of not ovulating. so im confused\\n\\nI do have some other symptoms, ive had facial hair appearing on my neck and chin increasingly over the past 2 years, but i am very dark anyway, and have had to wax from the age of 11. So im wondering if that is just my age as im now getting to my mid 20\\'s. I dont suffer with spots or break outs and ive never had any sort irregular bleeding of pain other than when i have my period. My periods are quite painful and quite irregular, between 28-36 days, but normally between 32-36 days, which my doctor said is a symptom of anovulatory cycles. Im a bit overweight, i could probably do with losing about a stone and a half.\\nDoes it sound like i could have PCOS? i get confused over the symptoms as i always hear something different. Can they find out just by a blood test? And what is the usual treatment?\\nthanks in advance\\np.s is it true that ovulation tests are always positive with PCOS? as i was using them and i only got a positive when i thought i was ovulating, due to my CM. The rest of the time they were negative. My doctor said i was probably getting the LH surge but not managing to release an egg\\nI have never heard of a blood test for PCOS they usually diagnose it using a trans vaginal ultrasounds (which is not as bad as it sounds and short term).  The hair growth sounds like Hirutism which usually Accompanies PCOS but is it\\'s own separate syndrome.\\nPCOS symptoms vary from person to person.  There are so many symptoms of PCOS and you may have only a couple of symptoms and still have it or all of the symptoms and have it.  You should do some research just so you can become more familiar with PCOS and see if you fit the profile of a PCOS woman.\\n\\nWhile there is no single test to determine whether or not you have PCOS, there are testing methods that they use to make a diagnosis.  Usually, a trans vaginal ultrasound is done like the person above mentioned as well as blood tests to check all of your hormone levels.  They use the results from both to determine if you have PCOS or not.\\n\\nAs for treatment, it depends on your symptoms, your doctor, etc.  One thing that I would recommend is that you see a Reproductive Endocrinologist.  They specialize in hormonal syndromes such as PCOS.  Good luck.  If you have anymore questions, just ask.\\ni have pcos and have 4 children. two of them are twins! you need to have your hormones checked to see if you have high amounts of testostoren I think thats your tsh but not sure and your estrogen levels. along with a trans vaginal ultra sound. With pcos your testosterone should be high because of a lack of estrogen. I take yasmin birth control pills. ( Very low dose of estrogen) works great.\\nI havent been diagnosed with PCOS, but i too suffer from all the symptoms possible i think! Hair growth, acne (boils), darkening of the skin, irregular periods, etc etc... I have been to the doctors, who i have to say was unhelpful, she examined me for underlying issues etc, but everything was clear...she said \"its possible you have PCOS, but we won\\'t know without tests\" Since then, nothing has happened...She hasnt done any blood tests or anything.\\n\\nI really want to go back to the docs, but in all honesty, i have quite a phobia about going! She did say to go back if my problems persist, which in hindsight i rally should, but i thought first i would try this weight loss thing and join a gym...Which i have, but nothing seems to be shifting fast! I would like any help and advice to relieve some of my symptoms, til i pluck up the courage to go to the docs?! Especially help with the hair growth...cheaper the better!!\\n\\nThanks in advance,\\n\\nK',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi All,\\n\\nI am new to this messageboard...I\\'m so glad to see that there\\'s a huge support group out there for PCOS folks like us!!\\n\\nAbout 4 years ago I was diagnosed with PCOS.  I had a TON of questions that could seemingly only be answered by the internet...***** had become my best friend.\\n\\nThen, last month, I was diagnosed with Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma...thyroid cancer.  I know that the endocrin system is totally intertwined...but wanted to know if any of you (or anyone you know) is in a similar position as me?  I guess, in a way, I\\'m trying to find the correlation between the 2.\\n\\nJust to fill you in...I had a thyroidectomy on 3/6 and am waiting to hear if I need the RAI treatment (crossing my fingers for \"NO\").\\n\\nHope to hear from you soon...\\n~RomyD\\nHi,\\n\\nI too have PCOS and thyroid cancer. Both conditions are difficult to live with at best; learn all you can, and understand that the people in your life will need to be educated as well. Make use of every avenue afforded by modern medicine; I have severe PCOS, and didn\\'t lose weight until I was placed on elephant doses of Metformin, 2,000 mg/day. I exercised, ate like a bird, and lost 100 pounds. Laser treatments were needed for my facial hair, and I was placed on Spirinolactone for testosterone problems. I  still had about 70 pounds to lose when the thryoid cancer diagnosis came; for 5 months my weight loss was put on hold as the cancer was treated. I had a thyroidectomy and RAI (it\\'s not as bad as you think) and placed on 200 micrograms of Synthroid daily, and my weight loss has resumed. Try to keep a positive attitude and realize that conventional diet wisdom is not for you because of your dual metabolic disorders; for example, goal-setting, commonly touted as a way to lose weight, is terribly demoralizing to a person with such profound metabolic problems. Our metabolism dictates how fast the wieght comes off, not some goal or program, diet or other weight loss scheme. Give yourself time; like yourself for who you are, and let everything else follow. Above all, take care of yourself; get rid of stressful people, a stressful job, or anything that drains you. You need positive people in your life; utilize all the help you can get, and bug your doctors with questions. It\\'s your body, your life. Let me know how you\\'re doing, ok?\\n\\nRenae\\n\\nHello renae_s, and RomyD!\\n\\n\\nI also have PCOS, but I have a colloid nodule.  I was suppose to have a biopsy on it but I was having terrible headaches and my endo thought I may have a sinus infection (and I have a  cyst on the sinuses), and he was correct.  So now he said he will try to do the biopsy before July 3 (this is my next appointment).  All of my blood work has come out normal, and he will not test me for antibodies, and the ft3 and ft4 when I am on Yasmin 28.  I am trying to decide should I let him do the biopsy or should I just change endo\\'s now.  Seems like most people want me to go to another endo.  My grandmother, uncles, cousin all have thyroid problems.  I have read that 1 out of 10 woman with PCOS will have a thyroid problem.  I will never get an answer to this, but I just don\\'t understand why is it that I have normal results pertaining to thyroid, but I have a colloid nodule.\\nCan anyone explain this to me?  Also, being on birth control does not help when having blood work done for thyroid.\\n\\nWe all have to support each other and it is nice to get that here on the boards.  I wish my work was more understanding....they just don\\'t seem to care.  I feel like they don\\'t believe me and think I am making this stuff up.  So between the stress of not knowing what is wrong with me and my work not showing any concern for me.  I have been trying to find a different job, but it is tough finding anything decent.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nCindy\\nRomy-\\n\\nIt seems there is a link between thyroid cancer and PCOS.\\n\\nI had a thyroidectomy last year -- papillary thyroid cancer.  I didn\\'t have the RAI because my tumor was in the grey area -- 50% of drs. would say to do it and 50% would say I can wait or not do it.\\n\\n*****.org is a great resource.\\n\\nWe\\'ve been trying to get pregnant for a year and a half, after one miscarriage pre-cancer.  Today I was diagnosed with PCOS. Hopefully the metaformin will help me get preg.  And hopefully a mild case of PCOS is not that hard to live with?\\n\\nI agree with the advice to hound your drs. with questions. Research your exact details.  Get copies of all your tests. Get second opinions when needed.  And get a therapist or try accupunture!\\nIt all helps.\\n\\nGood luck.\\nThanks everyone for responding.  It\\'s been a while since I\\'ve visited the boards because I\\'ve been dealing with a lot.  Just a re-cap...I had the RAI back in May of 06 and was just given a clean bill of health for the thyroid cancer as of May of this year\\none thing to celebrate!!!  i\\'m hoping to remain cancer free for the rest of my days...God willing.\\n\\nI\\'m on 225mcg of synthroid everyday and am supposed to be taking Metformin 1000 mcg(?) a day but it makes me sick so I stopped.  My endo put me on another med but it\\'s almost $30 a bottle so I\\'m thinking about sticking it out on the Metformin.\\n\\nMy husband and I would like to start trying to get pregnant.  It\\'s scary because it\\'s a road that I\\'ve been hesitant to take.  My doctors keep telling me that I have to lose weight before we try...but if I keep waiting for the weight to fall we will never get pregnant.  I am finding that I\\'m very lazy about doing things but am moderately active...yet still overweight.  I can\\'t blame it on anything else but my own will-power...so I gotta get movin to try to conceive naturally.\\n\\nI was wondering if anyone had any luck getting off the pill and continuing with Metformin to actually conceive?  I know it\\'s a matter of body chemistry...and everyone is different...but, just curious.\\nHi Romy\\nIt\\'s good to hear that you are cancer free!  I wanted to tell you, metformin side effects get better with time. Most everyone has the nausea and diarrhea at first, but it will go away. Eat when you take your pills, this helps with the nausea.  Talk to your doctor about starting with a 500 mg pill and adding another after a week or two. This gives you a chance to get adjusted and the side effects are easier also.  I can\\'t give you any advice on the getting pregnant; we haven\\'t been that lucky!\\nGood Luck!\\n\\nHi Romy,\\n\\nI am from the thyroid board too..........I am being worked up for thyroid cancer.......... It was always \"suspected\" that I had PCOS........ I was one of those mild cases........I was thin, had regular periods but did not ovulate monthly and had excessive hairiness for a blonde person........... labs mostly in normal limits........ I worked for an Endo and he told me I was mild PCOS. Also have had fat on my stomach for many years even though I was not overweight.....  I am fortunate to have 3 kids.......... 2 are from GIFT procedure.......they are all grown now........\\n\\nWell now I am struggling with my weight and have thyroid nodules.........and am starting into menopause\\nI have high BP and high triglyerides.\\n\\nAfter reading your posts I think there is a connection.\\n\\nHere are my recent labs.........How high is high insulin?\\n\\nHere is my Glucose\\nFasting 90 1/2 hour 151 1 hour 152 2 hour 121\\n\\nInsulin Fasting 7 and 2 hour was 52 normal < 17 It says the 52 is High....\\n\\nI also had a below normal Magnesium.........1.4 1.8 -3.0\\n\\nThanks.................

       " {'post': \"I haven't met too many other PCOS sufferers, do any of you suffer from night chills or sweats?  The chills are the worst!!  I used to get one every night.  When it became 2 a night, I finally sought help from the doctor.  It was horrible for both myself & my hubby (the shaking & shivering).  Then about a year ago came the night sweats. Not as nearly as bad as the chills but bothersome.  The meds are helping now.  Thank goodness.\\n\\nAnybody have similar problems?\\nBumping up.\\nCan't say that I do. I did want to reply to your post, as I understand the frustration of having posts going un-replied.\\n\\nDo you have other symptoms along with the chills and the night sweats? What are you taking for them? I've never heard of chills and night sweats as symptoms of PCOS, but it's not to say that it's impossible. What does your doctor think?\\n\\nA.\\nI suffer from HORRIBLE night sweats!!!!  I wake up many mornings soaked.  I've gotten better, but at one time, I would wake up every single morning literally soaked..............my husband was to the point that he didn't want to sleep in the bed with me cause it was just disgusting.  But, thankfully, it has gotten better on it's own.\\nI have experienced night sweats too even though I am on oral contraceptives and my endocrinologist told me that it is most likely from anxiety due to worrying about pcos so much!  He said sometimes we think every symptom is a result of pcos, but really it is from the anxiety associated with it.  However, if you experience hot flashes and night sweats when off the pill, for example during the week you are on the sugar pills and have your period, it could be from a drop in estrogen.  Just wanted to share my thoughts with you.  I was so scared when I started getting them thinking I had cancer or something!  Try not to worry because that just makes everything worse!\\nWhen I told my doctor about the sweats & chills she put me on spironolactone.  It does work for me, when I take it.  (With all the meds my family takes I don't always think I can afford to take it like I should.  You know, Mom always does without.)  The other night I had a bad night chill that woke me up out of a sound sleep & then I had night sweats the rest of night!  I just hate it!  It's frustrating!  I don't sleep & I keep my hubby awake.  The doctor never told me any different, so I just assumed it was the PCOS??  I do take birth control & have had hormonal issues.  I was just wondering if anyone else has suffered with the same issues.  Thanks.\\ni haven't had this problem yet\\nLord help me!!! Ha haha.....I have had 2 in the last week (night chills). I get so cold that I get out of bed, put on socks, a hoodie (put the hood up), crawl under my blanket and my hubby's duvet, and lay there wide awake so cold that I almost ache!!! I was diagnosed with PCOS a few years ago and never had anything like this and it actually never even crossed my mind that it could be PCOS until I saw your post! I have a stomach ulcer and am waiting on a call for surgery to have my gallbladder removed so I assumed it was a symptom of that! Please tell me there is somethhing they can do for the chills!? I can't handle them. Between my baby up half the night and gallbladder attacks and ulcer attacks, I don't think I could handle another problem!!! I am on birth control but I have an appointment at the dr tomorrow so I will let him know of this new symptom...if you have any advice for me, I'd love to hear it!! I'm cold just thinking about it so I'm going for a hot bath!!\\n\\nThe only relief I have found is the spironolactone.  If I miss it for awhile I go right back to the chills.  I get them so bad, I shiver, shake & my teeth chatter no stop.  My husband says it is almost like a seizure.\\n\\nI was beginning to think I was the only one out there that had this problem\\nI hope your doctor can get you straightened out.\\ni know this thread was started awhile ago, but i have pcos and also suffer from night sweats both when i was on and off the pill. does anyone know what causes it? i read that spirolactone helped. are the nightsweats related to testosterone levels?\\nI'm not sure what causes it.  I will ask my doctor when I go back to see her next month.  All I know is that she wasn't all that surprised when I told her what was going on.\\nI never had a problem with night sweats until I started the spirolactone last thursday. Last night I may have slept for an hour and all of a sudden I was sooooo hot\\nI had to come out of my clothes but then I couldnt sleep. I watched the clock until my alarm went off and then thats when I got sleepy. I know the doctor says not to stress about the issue of pcos but when its a bothersome to my everyday life, I cant help but to worry.

       " {'post': 'Hi everyone! Lets see where to begin. At my very first menstrual cycle at age 11, I had surgery to remove a ovarian cyst on my right side, which they said twisted around my fallopian tube and killed it. So they put me on birth control pills. I was on them from age 11 until approximatley age 21. I got pregnant after stopping the pills, with one fallopian tube. I have always had slightly darker hair on my upper lip. Well now at age 32, still got the lip hair and now acne. Last yr had to have another surgery for an ovarian cyst which was the size of a pineapple and they took out the other fallopian tube and an ovary. Since my pregnancy 10 yrs ago, I have this huge stomach. Everything else seems to be proportioned right except the fat stomach. So again I have had ovarian cysts since puberty, hairy lip and the past ten yrs acne. Oh and had some blood work done for thyroid and have high dheas. Normal is 40-325 and I am at 476. So just trying to see if there is any relation to all this. Thanks for reading.\\n\\nNessa\\nHello NessanJeff,\\n\\nI too have been hirsute since puberty and shortly after my first period my parents took me to see an endocrinologist to see if there was any problems with my hormones.  I have also always had a bad acne problem and still do (I am now almost 42).  At that time they found my testosterone level to be just slightly higher than normal but not by a lot.  My mother took me to have electrolysis and this removed my facial hair (upper lip, between the eyebrows, and around the chin area).  When I turned 20 I went on the birth control pill and stayed on it until age 41.  At 41 I started to have problems on the pill so I stopped it and this is when they discovered an 8 cm cyst on my left ovary.  They did more hormone tests and now my testosterone levels were completely normal, probably because the birth control pill is known to bind testosterone and this does not reverse even after the pill is stopped.  My cyst is still there though and I am keeping an eye on it.  My thyroid is verging on the high end of normal but no action is yet warranted (no symptoms).\\n\\nYou and I therefore have a lot in common and all of these things could very well be connected since the ovaries control hormonal levels.  Facial hair and acne are supposed to be caused by elevated levels of testosterone and ovarian cysts .. well no one really knows what causes unusually large and persisent cysts or complex cysts.  Women do grow simple functional cysts on their ovaries every month as part of their normal ovulation but sometimes our systems produce very large and persistent simple cysts or complex cysts and this seems to be quite common.\\n\\nI personally think it may be related to hormones but doctors don\\'t seem to check this when a woman is discovered to have an abnormal cyst on her ovaries.  Not sure why this is so.\\n\\nI am not sure I have been of much help but just to let you know that you are not alone.\\n\\nTake care.\\n\\nwhen i went to my doctor she explained to me that she would have to check the DHEAS levels because sometimes,when they are high,they tend to convert to testosterone which could be causing the facial hair i am experiencing.\\n\\nI am yet to do some reading to get a clear understanding of what she said but perhaps this would give you a lead since your DHEAS levels seem to be high.\\nHey thanks for replying. Sorry about the delay in my repsonse had a semi busy weeekend. Anyways Estria it does sound like we have things in common. My thyroid is also on the high end of normal. I had the raiu done and it came back at 32% upake. So again nothing major. I just want to know what is happening with my hormones and can\\'t seem to get a straight answer. I had my yearly pap done yesterday and I asked the doc about the pcos. She pretty much blew me off and asked if i had hair everywhere? I said no and that was it. She did take alot of blood, so no telling what the tests were, since they dont tell us much. I will keep posting after I get my labs back. Take Care.\\n\\nNessa\\nHi Nessa,\\n\\nI have also asked about PCOS but my doctors say that I don\\'t have this, despite the hirsutism, acne and ovarian cyst.  I think that PCOS may also involve irregular periods, weight gain (although I have always had a problem with my weight but this is common for women) and cholesterol problems (I do have high cholesterol but due to my HDL and not LDL .. ie. my \"good\" cholesterol is higher than normal).  When I mentioned my lifelong problem with hirsutism, my doctor did check my pituitary gland to ensure that this is normal.  This came out OK.\\n\\nSometimes I wonder if we are perhaps borderline cases which show test results as on the high side of normal but are not high enough to warrant an \"official\" diagnosis.  Keep in mind that just because your tests are in the so called \"normal\" range this does not mean that this is normal for you.  These normal ranges are based on the general population.  For example, endocrinologists are currently revising what is considered a normal TSH level.  They believe that instead of the previously accepted range of .5 to 5.0 the range should now be .3 to 3.0 or perhaps even 2.5.  This is because it is thought that in the original group of people who were tested in order to come up with the normal levels, there was a significant number who had minor hypothyroidism and therefore skewed the normal ranges.  According to these new ranges, I am now supposed to be considered hypothyroid (my level is at 3.80).\\n\\nLet us know how your tests come out.\\n\\nAll the best.\\n\\nEstria\\nWell had lots of blood tests done and my testosterone was normal. So my doc is sending me to an endocrenologist for the Hashimotos Thyroiditis and My high levels of Dheas. So after this i will let you know. I did find out last week, I have another ovarian cyst on my right side, i only have one ovary left. So I went to the gyno this week to find out what I should do about this. He says since i had the basketball sized cyst last yr and it was borderline cancer cells. That he is recommending a hysterectomy. So I am having it done the 13th of august. He is taking out the ovary and the uterus. Im scared becasue I will go into menopause at the age of 32. I will keep you guys posted. Thanks\\n\\nNessa\\nHello Nessa,\\n\\nI am bit confused.  Did you not say that when you were 11 you had an ovarian cyst that twisted your ovary and killed it ?  Then in another post you said that last year they removed a large ovarian cyst with another fallopian tube and ovary.  Did they perhaps only remove your fallopian tube when you were 11 and leave the ovary in tact and last year they removed this unattached ovary and your other fallopian tube ?  Meaning that you would have one ovary left and no fallopian tubes .. correct ?\\n\\nYou did not mention in your previous posts that the cyst they removed last year contained borderline cancer cells.  In this case, why on earth did they not take everything out then and there ?  At any rate, I think that under these circumstances this is a prudent decision to take.  Don\\'t worry so much about going into surgical menopause but rather be thankful that if there are any more borderline cancer cells on the remaining ovary they will be removed.  Surgical menopause is normally treated with hormone replacement therapy but discuss this with your doctor as hormonal therapy is usually not recommended for women with a history of breast or ovarian cancer.  Thank goodness, they removed the borderline cancer cells before they became cancer.\\n\\nAll the best and I wish you the speediest recovery from your surgery.\\nSo sorry about the confusion. Yes when I was 11 I had an ovarian cyst removed along with the left tube. At this point I had both ovaries. Last year I had a basketball sized cyst which contained borderline cancer cells. They removed the cyst, my other tube, and my left ovary. So now I have one remaining ovary and no tubes. I was told after the surgery last year to just have regular paps done. So this is what I did and again they found another cyst. I also forgot to say that after the surgery last year, when i was having my 4 week checkup they found something else growing on the same side. So I had to have another laparoatomy to get the blood clot that they found. So last year I had two laporatomy\\'s. I guess they didnt want me going through menopause so soon is why they didnt do the hysterectomy last year. But I am not going through surgery year after year. Would you do the same thing Estria? Thanks\\n]Nessa\\nHello Nessa,\\n\\nYou should know that pap smears will not uncover a problem with the ovaries.  Paps are only for cervical cancer and I have recently found out that there is a glandular type of cervical cancer that the pap cannot test for.  Women over the age of 30 should also have an HPV test to see if they have any of the high risk strains of the HPV virus in their system.  If not, then cervical cancer is unlikely and they should simply be retested every 3 years (according to the new norms of American gynecologists .. we Canadians are still behind on this and I will be asking my doctor about the HPV test at my next appointment).  Women under the age of 30 are more likely to fight off the HPV virus and should simply have a pap every year (according to these new norms).\\n\\nAlso, having a hysterectomy will not put you into surgical menopause, removing that last ovary will.  The ovaries are the things that regulate your hormones and even with your uterus in tact, no ovaries means no hormones which in turn means you would have to take hormone replacement therapy or face early menopause.\\n\\nAfter the removal of the cyst which contained borderline cancerous cells, what did your doctors tell you ?  Were they confident that all of the cancerous cells were taken out with that ovary ?  And why exactly did they take the tube out but not the remaining ovary ? Was there a problem with the tube perhaps ?  I assume that you are seeing a gynecological oncologist for this ?  If not, I would definitely consult one just to be sure that you are being proactive and preventing any possible problems.  Do they do a CA-125 blood test every year for you ?  I know that there are many forms of ovarian cancer, some of which are much slower than the most commonly known form that comes from the epithelial lining of the ovaries (or the abdomen).\\n\\nWhen it comes to cancer, especially ovarian cancer, you need to be extremely cautious and be sure that everything is covered.  I do not believe in the unnecessary removal of gynecological organs but where cancer is concerned I think that we are fortunate that those organs are not required for our survival.  Follow your doctors\\' instructions and don\\'t ever miss a check up.  I have several friends who became complacent after beating back cancer only to have it come back because they either forgot to have an important test done or because they delayed their yearly checkup.  Fortunately they are still alive but only after painful chemotherapy which may have been avoided had they kept up with their protocol.\\n\\nYou are fortunate to have had that cyst removed when the cells were still at the borderline stage.  Thank goodness for this.\\n\\nTake care and all the best.\\n\\nHey Esteria,\\nMy doc told me after removing the borderline cancerous cyst, to just have regular paps every year. I am now seeing a different gyn as the surgeon last yr was an oncologist. I have had a hpv and a ca125 test done. They both came back normal. Yes I agree about keeping all of your organs except when it comes to cancer. They are removing this cyst also because it is complex. I guess just having a hysterectomy sounds scary. Thanks for making me feel better. Take Care\\nNessa',\n",

       " {'post': 'I\\'m have an appointment with my GP tomorrow relating to something else.  I figured since I will be there 1st thing in the morning, I\\'m going to ask him to test me for PCOS.  Can someone possibly list the blood test he should run to determine if I have PCOS (or something else).\\n\\nA little history:\\n1.  I\\'m 42 yrs old and had a complete hysterectory 7 yrs ago.  Severe endometriosis, several ectopic pregnancies, etc.\\n2. Major facial hair.  I used to have \"1\" black hair right in the middle of my chin but now I have full mustache that I wax.  I have lots of chin, under chin and side of face hair - black & course.  I use an epilator and tweezers EVERY night.  I removed hairs last night and when I rub my chin right now, I can feel lots of hairs.\\n3. I\\'m 5\\'2\" and work hard at maintaing my obese weight to 160.  My normal weight all through my early life has never gone over 113.  I gained 50 pounds within 2 years.  Most of my weight is in my middle - yuk!!!\\n4.  Am on high cholesteral meds\\n5.  Am on high blood pressure meds (which seemed to help migraines tremendously!!!)\\n6.  Not interested in sex.  My husband is wonderful, sexy and treats me great.  The only issue is \"I don\\'t want to have sex\".  I\\'m supposed to be in my prime and am missing out.  My unhappiness with my body could have lots to do with this.\\n7. Oh, also hair on toes, belly and upper upper thighs\\n\\\\\\n\\nPlease, someone help!!!!\\n\\nPCOS is diagnosed via a vaginal ultrasound not by blood work.\\nWhat 2plus said is true. However, blood work can be used in conjunction with an ultrasound in some cases (such as mine) where the ultrasound and/or symptoms are borderline. Seeing as how you\\'ve had a complete hysterectomy, the u/s would be useless. My endocrinologist checked my LH, FSH, LH:FSH ratio, Prolactin, Estrodiol, Total Estrogen, Testosterone, and DHEA-S. The LH:FSH ratio and Testosterone are the really big ones. Most of the symptoms of PCOS are actually caused by high testosterone, which is why the pill is a common treatment. Also, you should probably be checked and see if you have insulin resistance. Although I doubt even an expert would be able to give you definitive answer as to whether or not you have PCOS due to the hysterectomy, a GP, OB/GYN, or endo should be able to tell you how likely it is. Hope this helps, and good luck\\n.\\n2Plus is right.. but blood work DOES help in diagnoisng PCOS. For instance, most gynos test for elevated fasting insulin levels-- to see if you are insulin resistant testosterone (biggie!) and LH:FSH ratio. My gyn did a completel work up of all sex hormones, fasting, just to make sure.  You do need a u/s to find out if you have PCOS, but most gynos also order a bloodwork as well, so no harm in asking for one. Keep us posted!!!\\nPCOS is not ALWAYS diagnosed through a vaginal ultrasound.   I\\'ve had at least three of those and none of my gynecologists (all different) diagnosed me.  PCOS may or may not cause cysts, so vaginal ultrasounds are kind of pointless.\\n\\nGo to an endocrinologist and have them check your blood.  See if you\\'re insulin resistant/pre-diabetic.  And, obviously, have them check your hormone levels.  Maybe you have PCOS, maybe you\\'re pre-menopausal, maybe both.\\n\\nGood luck.\\nTrue, PCOS isn\\'t ALWAYS diagnosed through u/s. But, at the same time, you could have PCOS with all your hormones in the normal range. Honestly, dearest, I think you rbest bet, to rule out any mistakes is to get both. Otherwise, you coudl just start second guessing and that\\'s no fun\\n\\nPlease explain the point of a vaginal ultrasound if I don\\'t have anything to look at?  I had a complete hysterectomy - nothing is left.\\n\\nAlso, I went to GP this morning after fasting.  We discussed all my concerns and he ran my bloodwork.  I should get result in 1 to 2 days.\\nOh sorry!! I didn\\'t even realize that you had a complete hysterectomy!! I\\'m a Frenchie\\nand English is my second language, so I mss things sometimes\\nAnyway, good luck with your bloodwork and let us know how it goes!\\nMy 22 yr old daughter was just diagnosed with PCOS and insulin resistant diabetes. Is that a young age for this condition? What prompted her to see the DR was a heavy period that lasted 2 months. They did the ultra sound and blood work and she got the bad news. I had never heard of it before. Can someone tell me what my daughter is in store for? They put her on the pill and the period continued but finally stopped after about 2 months of taking the pill and skipping the fake ones. Her dr also gave her a medicine that starts with an M for the diabetes that she\\'s supposed to take when she eats. She takes only half a pill and has terrible diareha so then does not take the pill. She does check her glucose after eating and so far it has not been in the high range. She just graduated from college and has been depressed over this whole thing. She is overweight. Did the overweight help bring on the PCOS or does the PCOS tend to make you overweight?  So far she has no facial hair or hair loss. I appreciate any info that someone with this condition can give.\\nWorried Mom\\nHi..I\\'m 24 and was diagnosed with PCOS 2 years ago. I hadn\\'t had a period for 1 year, and decided it was time to find out what was wrong with me. For 8 years doctors kept telling me it was stress, and that is why I had irregular periods. Outside of the diabetes, your daughter should be okay. As long as she stays on the pill, she should be able to start losing a little bit of weight when she tried to now. PCOS causes weight gain when not treated. I have lost about 20 pounds in the passed 2 years of being on the pill. There is still hope for her. It is devastating at first, I was upset when I found out that was what I had. Your bady just produces (well for me) too much testosterone, and progestrine. Not enough estrogen. That is what fills up IN your ovary, and cause your eggs to not drop like they should. So, then you get cycts in your ovaries, which can become cancerous later in life if left untreated. I hope this helps a little bit. Things get better as time goes by!\\nNo, 22 isn\\'t that young.  I am 20 and was just diagnosed.  I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ve had it since 17 or 18.\\nDitto for what innerstrength said. I was diagnosed at 17. I found an article in a medical book that said that PCOS normally occurs around the time of puberty, but isn\\'t diagnosed until much later in life due to the fact that alsmot all young ladies are irregular for the first few years. Also, here is a similar comment as well as an explanation of PCOS from the American Medical Association.\\n\\n“However, polycystic ovarian syndrome is recognized as a complication of insulin resistance, a condition in which the body must produce abnormally high amounts of insulin to regulate blood sugar. The high levels of insulin, in turn, stimulate the ovaries to produce too much testosterone and other male sex hormones (androgens), which brings on the disorder’s characteristic symptoms. Polycystic ovarian syndrome is thought to be a form of metabolic syndrome (also called prediabetes) with a strong link to type 2 diabetes and heart disease.\\nThe disorder usually appears in late childhood, around the time of puberty, and lasts throughout an affected women’s life.”\\nDear GrannyO, I stopped having my periods at age 16 but I wasn\\'t diagnosed with PCOS until I was 23.  But I didn\\'t actually start treatment until I was 29. I\\'m now 32 and I\\'ve learned to deal with this condition for over 10 years now.  I\\'m guessing the M medication your daughter is taking is Metformin?  I\\'m also taking metformin and in the first months was bad, I had a lot of nausea and constipation, but eventually I got used to it and it\\'s been making wanders for me.\\nEvery woman deals differently when it comes to PCOS.  So I\\'m writting this message from my own personnal experience.  I went through the denial stage, then hanger, then I was very depressed until I finally accepted the way I was and decided to do something about it.  The bad news is that there isn\\'t a cure for PCOS, the \"good news\" is that you can change your life in ways that you\\'ll be able to deal with PCOS.  I know some people might say easier said than done right?  Well that\\'s right.  It\\'s very hard work but it\\'s not impossible.  For me the main thing to do was to control my blood sugar and weight because I was at risk of becoming diabetic and having heart problems.  I also had to lose weight and change my eating habits.  So that\\'s exactly what I did.  Metformin, together with exercising and a healthy diet lowered my weight, my cholesterol and my insuling levels.  I started having my periods after I took metformin but went on the pill (yasmin) because my husband and I weren\\'t ready for kids.  You said your daughter was overweight and that\\'s most likely because of PCOS.  In my opinion, loosing weight and controlling the sugar levels and basically living a healthy life are the keyes to control PCOS.  With your support, which is very important, she will hopefully be able to deal with this condition.  She just needs to do a lot of research on PCOS and ask question and really understand PCOS.  I wish you and your daughter all the best.\\nI was just officially diagnoised and I am 54...........everyone looks back now and says \"ahhhhhhhhhhh that is what it was\".........\\n\\nDepression/anxiety and facial hair started the day I started my period at 12...... but I was thin and my periods were regular......\\n\\nMore  body hair at 26..............but all my labs were normal\\n\\nI had regular periods like clockwork but had trouble getting pregnant...ended up have clomid and pergonal and GIFT my last two.......\\n\\nEnded up in hospital 5 times with ruptured ovarian cysts.......\\n\\nEven though  I was thin I started to develope tummy fat at age 26...........\\n\\nWhen having GIFT to get pg........I only made 3 eggs instead of 16 to 24 like other women..........big red flag.........age 35\\n\\nage 47 sudden high blood pressure and elevated lipids..........gained 30 pounds in one year no matter how I dieted and exercised...........\\n\\nThis year meeting a very good Endocrinologist while being evalutated for thyroid cancer.......he took a very thorough history and said...........guess what ?

I just want to tell you not to lose any hope about getting pregnant.  It is always healthier to lose a bit of weight,  it will increase your chances of getting pregnant and it will be better for you and for the baby.\\nBefore we decide we wanted to have a baby my doctor recomended that I went on a diet so I lost close to 30 pounds.  I know it\\'s hard work, I had to do it but it\\'s worth it.  Don\\'t do any crazy diets that say you can lose a lot of weight in only a couple of months, it took me close to one year to lose the 30 ponds.  All I did was exercise 5 days a week for about 1-2 hours per day, and I eat healthy meals and snacks, and stayed away from sweets, bad carbs and fried stuff.  I ate about every 2-3 hours and was never hungry.  Of course I had my craving so once in a while I had a little bit of chocolate or if I went to a birthday party I had a piece of cake.\\nIt is a constant battle for us that have PCOS but don\\'t give up I\\'m sure with the right doctors and treatments you will get pregnant and don\\'t let anybody else tell you otherwise.',\n",

There isn't a miracle pill or a shot that make it go away.  What you can do is change your way of living so that you can minimize the symptoms of PCOS and other major complications it causes, such as, heart disease, strokes, diabetes, infertility, obesity.  Some other symptoms are irregular periods, acne, facial hair growth, cysts on your ovaries, insulin resistance.  Please remember that every case is different, not all women have all symptoms, some have only a few, others have most of them.  I personally treat PCOS as if it was diabetes.

PCOS can be controlled.  The problem with PCOS is that there are SOOOO many symptoms that may or may not be present and you more or less have to treat the symptoms....not the syndrome!  There isn't a single treatment method that works for everyone.  Treatment varies depending on the individual.  Another problem is that a lot of PCOS women see the wrong doctors!!!  For adequate treatment, you should be seeing either an endocrinologist or a reproductive endocrinologist.  Not a regular physician or even a gynecologist.  While they may have knowledge of PCOS, they do NOT specialize in it.\\nI want to hope that there\\na cure for PCOS.

That had never crossed my mind.\\n\\nI went to get a pap a week ago and couldent do it, it hurt too bad. (Yeah im a virgin) and im by no means loose down stairs so it was just a big pain.\\n\\nCan the DR. do blood work or somehting to see if I have this?\\n\\nYES!  Your MD can do ALOT of blood work.\\n\\nThe need to check your FSH versus LH levels at a key point in your menstrual cycle.  you also need your Estrogen, testosterone, DHEA levels checked.\\n\\nTriglycerides, cholesterol, IGF, and glucose and insulin levels checked.  When you have all of these it is possible to point toward PCOS.  Final determining factor is an ovarian targeted ultrasound.\\n\\nGood luck.  Talk to your OB about your concerns.  They will be able to get the right tests done.\\n\\nMG\\nA simple ultrasound could clearly show if you have PCOS or anything else on/in your ovaries. It\\'s said that an ultrasound examination is best at revealing cysts.\\n\\nThe estrogen & progesterone blood tests could come normal / within the range, but many doctors don\\'t consider their ratio, which is of great importance.\\n\\nPlease, keep us updated. I\\'m a virgin, too, so I can understand you! I\\'ve never even tried to do any pap. By the way, I do have an ovarian cyst, but not PCOS. Anyway, I\\'ve read a lot about PCOS, too.\\n\\nHow high is your cholesterol? Conventional medicine makes money on cholesterol drugs and myths! Don\\'t be afraid if it\\'s just slightly up the range.\\nHow about your iron, better Ferritin, level? You could ask to be tested for Ferritin, which is the iron storage in your body. Most of the symptoms you mentioned could be due to anemia.\\nHello,\\n\\nSome of the symptoms you describe do not necessarily go with PCOS.  Often but not always, PCOS includes having many small cysts on the ovaries (sort of like a necklace pattern of small cysts) and menstrual irregularities.  A pelvic ultrasound would uncover the cysts.\\n\\nHave you considered some sort of nutritional imbalance ?  Do you eat a healthy diet which includes a lot of fresh vegetables and fruit ?  Have you tried taking a daily vitamin supplement in order to fill in for what you are not getting in your diet (vitamin D, calcium, magnesium and folic acid are classic deficiences in most women) ?  Do you drink enough water to avoid dehydration (which most people don\\'t notice throughout the day) ? Probiotics will also help your immune system and general overall health as they help with the proper absorption of food (ie. so that your body ingests the necessary nutrients from the foods that you eat).  Most people are particularly deficient in magnesium so you may want to supplement this if you are not getting enough .. this is particularly true if you are taking a lot of calcium.  Many people are not aware that in addition to Vitamin D, you need to match calcium with magnesium (at least 2:1 ratio) in order to get the full benefit.  I personally try to eat a couple of handfuls of walnuts everyday as they are rich in magnesium and Omega 3 fatty acids.  You will know if you are taking in too much magnesium as you will begin to have loose bowel movements.\\n\\nWhy not make an appointment with a nutritionist to try to see if this is a nutritional imbalance.  Naturally you should also make sure that your symptoms are not caused by any medications that you are taking.  If you believe that this is a hormonal imbalance, have your free and bound testosterone tested to see if this is the problem (hair issues, acne and some of the symptoms you describe may be tied to this).  An endocrinologist would be very helpful with hormonal issues so perhaps a referral to one might be prudent.\\n\\nI hope I have been of some help to you and I hope you resolve your problem very soon.  All the best.\\n\\nEstria\\nEstria, I liked reading your post! Just couldn\\'t help letting you know\\nYou seem to know quite a lot about healthy living!\\nHello peace4health,\\n\\nI was actually \"forced\" to learn about a lot of things because after turning 40, all sorts of things started to go wrong and I had to finally make a decision to either wallow in self pity and start paying rent at my doctor\\'s waiting room or to grab the bull by the horns and change my lifestyle and attitude once and for all.  I am glad that I chose the second one.  I hit the books and began to read a lot (only reputable articles, texts and medical studies, of course).  I have since lost 50 lbs, I walk everyday (I believe in inspirational exercise that one can maintain over a lifetime as opposed to going to the gym and being miserable .. this exercises the mind as well as the body) and I do my very best to eat a healthy diet (less meat and more veggies and fruit) with a few vitamin and mineral supplements.  I also made the decision to go off the birth control pill after 20 years.  All of these things solved most of my health problems including my horrible hip and back pain and my irregular menstrual bleeding (this last by going off the pill).  I still indulge once in a while, of course, but I am much more careful.  The ovarian cyst that has been sitting on my left ovary for over a year still keeps me in check.\\n\\nSometimes it takes a health experience to force us into action and this has definitely been my case.  I now actually LIVE life instead of passively living through it.  I do not crave junk and actually find it unappetizing but nevertheless addictive (a very strange relationship as I discovered on a recent concert tour where I was forced to eat fast food for a few days) and I look forward to my daily walks around the lake close to where I live when I am away from distractions and free to think about anything I want.\\n\\nAll the best to you.\\n\\nEstria\\nDear Estria, do you mean you have a cyst\\nor\\nyour ovary? Mine is inside my left ovary, but I usually read about cysts\\novaries.\\n\\nAll the best to you, too\\n\\nHello,\\n\\nHee hee, actually I have never noticed the use of the two different prepositions before.  I believe that ovarian cysts develop inside the ovary.  I think that more precisely it is in the epithelial lining of the ovary because when a follicular cyst bursts open to release its egg it is actually tearing the lining of the ovary each time.  I have read that this heals incredibly fast though and the woman is none the wiser when this is going on (another one of those miracles of nature).\\n\\nDo you also have a cyst that is persistent (ie. won\\'t go away on its own) ?  If so, what have your doctors recommended for you ? Mine has been hanging around for so long that I think I will never get rid of it, unless I decide to have it removed.  But who knows, perhaps having lost a lot weight and all of these wonderful changes I have made to my lifestyle will have an effect .. if not, its presence has certainly changed my life for the better so it is true that every cloud has a silver lining.\\n\\nAll the best.\\n\\nEstria\\nIn case of PCOS, they say the cysts are\\nthe ovaries, but to my knowledge, follicular, luteal, dermoid, and other cysts are\\nthe ovary.\\n\\nMine has been found about 9 years ago. But in these years, it appeared and then disappeared for some months. It was diagnosed as a follicular/functional cyst every time. I was suggested to take birth control pills, which I refused, because I knew they would mess up my normal ovulation cycle, thus making a way for more problems in the future. If you stop my ovulation and no cyst appears, you\\'ve just cheated my ovaries! Take away the pills, and a cyst appears again. Pills don\\'t cure the cause...\\n\\nWell, the one I have now has been there since a few months now, and it doesn\\'t look like a follicular one. I\\'m just watching it (it hasn\\'t grown in the past 3 months), as well as trying some alternative methods, though I\\'m still searching as to what can be more effective.\\n\\nPeace to you\\n\\nPeace4health,\\n\\nAre you at all aware that ALL women grow follicular cysts on their ovaries every month ?  This is completely normal and I don\\'t quite understand why they want to put you on the pill in order for you to stop getting follicular cysts ?!  If your cysts come and go then you are COMPLETELY NORMAL.  I am wondering, how large are these cysts ?  If they are less than 5 cms then you have absolutely nothing to worry about.  The reason my cyst is a bit more concerning is that it may not be a normal functional (ie. follicular or corpus luteal) cyst because this same cyst has sat there for over a year now and functional cysts come and go (AND it is a large 8 cm cyst).\\n\\nI am curious, during the 9 years that you have been watching your cysts, have you had any of them remain for a year or more and then go away ?  This would be interesting to note because my radiologists are always saying how my cyst looks just like a follicular cyst but for some reason it won\\'t go away.  Mucinous cysts look just like follicular cysts but they are not functional (ie. part of a woman\\'s normal functioning) so they remain until they are removed through surgery.  I have heard of instances where women had persistent simple cysts which eventually go away but I don\\'t know what persistent means (3 months .. 6 months .. a year ?).  I would love to think that there is a possibility that my cyst will disappear which would make it a persistent follicular cyst.  Especially since it was discovered after I went off the birth control pill after 20 years of use (which may stimulate the ovaries to produce larger than normal follicular cysts).  At any rate, unless I have surgery, I will never know what kind of cyst it is.\\n\\nI am completely with you on the birth control pill issue.  I have done a lot of reading and recent studies have shown that the BC pill does nothing for ovarian cysts.  Who knows,  the hormones may even make them grow.  I have also recently discovered that there is a very rare side effect of the pill ... a hepatic adenoma (liver tumour) which, although benign, may turn cancerous over time or may rupture (which is serious).  Therefore doctors usually have to take these out and resect the liver (some or most of which grows back).  This side effect is kept a secret and my doctor never discussed this side effect with me (just bloodclotting, blood pressure, no smoking while on the pill etc..).  In all fairness to general practitioners though MOST of them don\\'t even know about this side effect and some actually try to switch pills when a woman presents with such a tumour, thinking that it was the brand of pill as opposed to the use of hormones altogether.  The normal risk for this type of tumour is one in one million.  With the pill this risk increases to 4 in 100,000 OR to put it another way, 1 in 25,000.  This is a fortyfold increase in risk which, in my opinion, should be discussed with the patient !\\n\\nIf you are curious about this side effect, there is a hepatic adenoma thread that has been going for quite some time.  Just do a general search on these boards and you will find it.  None of these young ladies knew about the side effect, although there is a little something in the insert about possibly developing a benign liver tumour.  Most would think, oh it\\'s benign, but despite this, you still have to have it removed due to the possibility of it becoming cancerous AND you have to have a part of your liver removed in the process.  THIS they don\\'t mention in the insert.\\n\\nSorry this is so long but I just thought I would mention this little piece of information that most women are kept in the dark about.\\n\\nAll the best,\\n\\nEstria\\nDear Estria, yes I am aware that our follicles grow each month (when we\\'re healthy, of course\\n) and then they \\'go away\\' as we ovulate. I have had follicular cysts stay for a few months, I\\'m not sure for how long, because I didn\\'t \\'watch\\' them regularly.\\n\\nI checked my ultrasound reports now, so I can give you a better answer (and so I\\'ll know better, too!). The 1st one (the 1st discovered) stayed there since end April till mid November, which makes it almost 6 months. Interestingly, during these 6 months, it shrank a bit, losing about half of its size (from 4cm to 2cm nearly), and there was much liquid in \\'cul-de-sac\\' at that time.\\n\\nBy mid Nov. I had a seemingly normal follicle which persisted, though. It was there for 5 months, maybe more. I\\'m sure that 8 months later it wasn\\'t there, but can\\'t say when exactly it went away, between 5th to 8th months.\\n\\nOther 2 times I can say for sure about, the cysts disappeared in 4 and 3 months.\\n\\nThe one I have now has been found in June 2008, already a 4,1cm one, which means it has been there since a few months earlier. Since July, its size has been almost unchanging: 5cm. One month it was 4,5x5,5, another month - 5,1x5, so that\\'s actually the same size, only different \\'position\\' inside the ovary.  So 5cm has been there since 4 months. To be continued...\\n\\nThe pills are usually synthetic estrogens, right? And ovarian cysts are thought to be caused by excessive estrogen: estrogen dominance. I\\'ve read they can also form because of iodine deficiency.\\n\\nSo if, as studies claim, I need adequate\\nprogesterone for my ovaries to function well and to stop having persisting follicles (and progesterone is produced\\novulation), how can the pill benefit me?! It just has no other option than to harm me more...\\n\\nI didn\\'t know of the pills\\' hepatic adenoma side effect; thanks for the information! I wonder what other side-effects of the pills will be discovered yet, other than liver tumors! No wonder they hurt the liver, for it just isn\\'t made to process synthetic hormones.\\n\\nBest regards,\\npeace4health\\nHi peace4health,\\n\\nYes the estrogen dominance argument is used to sell progesterone cream.  I have also heard about the iodine deficiency (I guess both of us have been trying to get rid of these damned things).\\n\\nI am not convinced that this is the cause of ovarian cysts.  When they found mine I was supposedly progesterone dominant as it was the progesterone that was causing my uterine bleeding problem.  One of the doctors that I had seen said that the triphasic formulations have a high progesterone component which is sometimes \"harsh\" on the uterine lining.  I always began to bleed irregular when I began the higher progesterone portion of my pill cycle so this made a lot of sense.  When I went off the pill, the bleeding went back to normal so the endometrial atrophy argument must have been correct.\\n\\nAlso, a lot of women in early pregnancy are diagnosed with ovarian cysts and usually the body produces more progesterone relative to estrogen after ovulation.  For all we know the progesterone component prevents the cysts from opening to release their egg and they remain there for a longer period.  Another reason may be a screw up with the Luteneizing hormone or the follicle stimulating hormone which are both involved in ovulation.\\n\\nIt is reassuring to hear that someone else has ovarian cysts that have remained for quite some time before disappearing.  I would love to believe that the cyst that I have is a very large follicular cyst and not an abnormal cyst.  Who knows, perhaps my body is still recovering from my having been on the pill for 20 years.\\n\\nBy the way, other risks of the pill include a slightly increased risk of breast cancer (which supposedly disappears after 10 years of going off the pill), bloodclots (this is a biggy and why they are always reducing the estrogen component of the pill) especially if you smoke, urinary tract infections (which I suffered with for years), breast tenderness (ditto) and some other liver type issues (since these hormones are processed in the liver).\\n\\nTake care of yourself and I hope you find an answer soon for all of these cysts.  What a pain in the you know what, eh ?  All the best.\\n\\nEstria\\nThank you for additonal info\\n\\nI forgot to mention that at times my cysts didn\\'t look like follicular ones, as they had a thick capsule and inhomogeneous structure. But even those went away, thanks God! The one I have now doesn\\'t look like a follicular one, either. It even looks like 2 or even 3 follicules have joined to make 1 cyst, with homogeneous but unclear contents (not simple liquid as is w/follicular cysts, which appear black on ultrasound). So I have twins or more\\n',\n",

Increased hair growth and in strange places (I actually had a small blonde hair growing under my eye of all places...) and increased weight and blood pressure. I haven't experienced any dark patches of skin or excessive amounts of acne though.\\n\\nNow - I even at the age of 23, have never gone to a gynecologist or gotten any kind of pelvic exam or anything, though I do see a normal doctor every 6 months to keep my blood pressure under control. I need to know if there is some way I can avoid going to a gyno and possibly avoid any kind of pelvic exam as I'm an extremely shy person and I would die if I had to do that. Is there a way I can find out if I have PCOS without doing all of that? ie Blood tests or ultrasounds?  Thanks in advance.\\nHi Olivia, some of the ways you can get diagnosed for PCOS is through blood work, pelvic ultrasounds or a small procedure called laparoscopy.  I would suggest seeing a gynecologist or an endocrinologist.  As a woman I would highly suggest you get a vaginal exam, it is so important to have a pap smear test on a yearly basis.  This test can detect many conditions including cervical cancer.  I understand that you are very shy and it's never comfortable for any woman to have this test done, but you can request to have a female physician to perform the test and it doesn't take that long only a couple of minutes. Good luck.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'So I stopped by the holistic doc\\'s office and asked the receptionist if he tests for insulin resistance since he said by my labs it looks like I have PCOS.

I don\\'t go back to him for about two months and have re-testing for my hormones/thyroid in the meantime before I go back.\\n\\nI called my ob\\'s office and talked to the PA.

What exactly is the test for insulin resistance?\\n\\nI know that IR is associated w/PCOS, but anybody know like what percentage of people w/PCOS *have* IR?  Does it cause any symptoms?  By the way, I did have one IGF that came back high.  The repeat came back normal.\\nHello!  I\\'m a fellow \"cyster\", diagnosed with PCOS about 10 years ago.  I was diagnosed and treated for stage 3 thyroid cancer this summer, but some of the symptoms are alike and my Dr.s think I\\'ve had the cancer for years.  Makes me wonder how/if they were related.  ANYway, as far as I understand the syndrome, ALL PCOS sufferers have some insulin resistance.  That is what makes our hormones out of whack and consequently why we tend not to ovulate.  My new endo says that he will test me for PCOS again in a couple months.  It\\'s been many years, but I do not remember doing a fasting test.  The bloodwork will show your estrogen, testosterone and maybe another hormone level in your blood.  Your Dr. might have already tested these and that\\'s what has him thinking you\\'ve got PCOS.  I would talk to him personally and ask that question and see what test he could do for IR.  A fairly new treatment plan for PCOS ladies is to start Metformin/Glucophage, which is a diabetic drug.  I\\'m a firm believer that it\\'s one factor in us having our miracle daughter.  I would also HIGHLY recommend reading a good PCOS book that explains the syndrome and how to deal with it.  There are many with good reviews on ******.\\nBest of luck!\\nI can tell you one fasting insulin is not going to tell you if you have Insulin resistance........my fasting is always normal and my 2 hour Post prandial is sky high......you need a 2 hour PP insulin done to tell the story.

Or was that not a problem for you?  When I first started taking Metformin (about 6 years ago) it helped me lose weight and ovulate more regularly.

Do you think I might need a different med?  By the way (and I\\'m sure you know this from our thyroid posts\\n) I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and they think I\\'ve had it at least that long.

Almost all pregnant women have this glucose test because of gestational diabetes and you might have another one between 24-28 weeks of your pregnancy.

       " {'post': 'So I have PCOS, I am 32 years old, married for almost 5 years. I have endometriosis but recently DX w/ PCOS. I am overweight, I weigh 200 and I am 5\\'3\". I have tried to use the ovulation kits - this is the 2nd month, and I am not ovulating for 2months in a row....we are trying to conceive. My OBGYN is referring me to a fertility specialist but I read that losing weight can help you ovulate normally....does anyone know about this?\\nWhile losing weight can possibly help, having PCOS itself whether you have your weight under control or not, often makes conception a challenge.  I went through an infertility specialist and begun treatment right away (after trying for 2 years) and I got pregnant with my 2nd child after 4 rounds of Clomid....and that was after not having a period for 5 years.  Back in October of 2005, I started losing weight thanks to walking and ever since then...my periods became regular....and to my surprise....on Fathers Day last year, I discovered I was pregnant with my 3rd child (not planned).....and I\\'m due in 5 weeks.  So, there is hope because I got pregnant when I wasn\\'t even trying and never thought that would happen.  I would definitely see the specialist....and it doesn\\'t hurt to lose weight either.  That can always have a positive impact on your menstrual cycle.  Best wishes to you!\\nThank you so much for your response. That is exactly what I am trying to do, lose weight and also call the specialist this week!! I will keep you updated. Congrats on your children and your 3rd..how do you feel? My sister is preg. w/ # 3 and due also in about 4-5 weeks...\\nThank you....and best wishes to you.  Just be patient and try not to stress.  It\\'ll happen.  With todays technology, just about anything is possible!!!  As for how I\\'m feeling.....I am so ready for this to be over!!!  It can be very exhausting.  Best wishes to your sis too!\\n\\nDo you know what type of doctor your OB/GYN is referring you to?  Your best bet is to see a Reproductive Endocrinologist.  They specialize in infertility and hormonal syndromes such as PCOS.....so you\\'d more or less be tackling both.  I\\'ll keep my fingers crossed for you.  I know what it is like to be in your shoes!!\\nPCOS makes you insulin resistant, which messes with your hormones (specifically LH, which you need to ovulate) and increases your production of testosterone.  With good diet and exercise, the insulin regulates better and hormones get in better ranges.  It\\'s true that just having PCOS means a higher risk of fertility problems.  While there are \"skinny cysters\" out there with infertility, there are far more of us (myself included) that have weight issues.  I highly recommend reading a PCOS diet book.  We gave up ttc after 5 years of fertility drugs and surgeries.  We decided to adopt so I took a second job to help w/ the cost.  I lost 25lbs through activity (waitressing after teaching all day) and less sugar in my diet.  I really believe that is what helped us get pregnant.  We found out we were pregnant just 2 days after turning in our final adoption papers.\\nGood luck with everything!',\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi,\\n\\nI am new to this board. I was just diagnosed with an ov. cyst about 2 centimeters. I had pain, and bladder pressure the first month and then a very easy month. This month I have had a ridiculous amount of pain, early morning pressure and strong symtoms of PMDD...bloating and extreme mood swings and exhaustion. I am waiting for ultrasound results of my ovaries and I am contacting my doc tomorrow. I am wondering if anyone here has similar symptoms b/c of PCOS and if you take a birth control pill to combat those symptoms. Does anyone have any recommendations? If this has gone badly for those of you here please let me know. I am not looking forward to the pill nausea!\\n\\nThanks in advance,\\n\\nMukadzi\\nHi Mukadzy,\\n\\nA 2 cm ovarian cyst is probably just a normal follicular cyst that will go away in the next three menstrual cycles.  Having one cyst does not mean you have PCOS.  All women have follicular cysts on their ovaries .. they contain eggs that are released into the fallopian tubes at ovulation.  See about going to a followup ultrasound to ensure that the cyst has disappeared.\\n\\nPCOS normally goes with a host of other symptoms such as hirsutism, high blood pressure, diabetes, irregular periods, tendency towards weight gain etc.. The usual sign on an ultrasound is a necklace like pattern of small cysts on the ovaries.  I say normally and usual because not every person fits the book definition of PCOS.  In your case, you have a small cyst (I assume that it is a simple cyst, right ? ie. filled with fluid and nothing else) which is most likely a follicular cyst that all women get.  If the cyst is not gone in 3 months or if it has changed in any way, then you need to investigate further.\\n\\nI myself have an 8.5 cm simple cyst on my left ovary AND I am hirsute (facial hair).  However, a diagnosis of PCOS has not been made after many blood tests etc.. My sister also has a tendency towards facial hair (although not as much as me) and we are mediterranean in origin so most likely, the facial hair is a cultural thing.\\n\\nTalk to your doctor about this.  Unless you are truly PCOS and you are having irregular periods, your doctor will most likely not recommend the pill so I think you are safe on that score.\\n\\nTake care and good luck with your doctor's appointment.\\n\\nEstria\",\n",

You would think it would, but my sister is still overweight despite taking Levothyroxin and I have a friend who's been on medication for years now and she still really struggles, so don't think it's going to be a miracle cure unfortunately. Maybe if you get metformin for the PCOS it'll help. Another friend of mine took it and it really did help her, she lost loads - in conjunction with healthy eating and exercise.

I believe I was about 12 when I started developing hair on my stomach, and a slight hair-growth over my top lip. The growth on my legs was horrendous, and I've got hair even on my thighs. My arms aren't exactly smooth either.\\n\\nMy period first started a few months before I turned nine, but when I became about 12 years old, my period; which once was the regular once a month, suddenly started only appearing 3 - 4 times a year, and following it was terrible cramps, which before then I've never had!\\n\\nWhen I was at the gynecologist, she didn't even take an internal ultrasound on me, because I had absolutely every symptom of PCOS, so she said it wasn't necessary to look for cysts just yet. Also the fact that I had just developed Diabetes 2 added to the factor.\\n\\nShe subscribed me to Yasmin for the PCOS, and my doctor subscribed me to 500 mg Metformin each day for my Diabetes. However when I started on the Yasmin, I started getting horrible stomach cramps, that left for after a few second, before coming back a bit later.\\n\\nNow for my questions:\\n\\nIs this a normal side effect of the Yasmin?\\n\\nIs there any additional side-effects of taking both Yasmin and Metformin?\\n\\nI read somewhere that taking Metformin and Yasmin at the same time could increase the blood sugar levels is this true? My blood sugar has increased since I started on the Metmorfin.\\n\\nIs there any way I can get rid of the hair-growth? Whenever I shave my legs for example, it only takes about an hour before I can feel hard, prickly hair on my legs, and my stomach is no better. I stopped having swimming lessons at school (which were mandatory from 3rd to 8th grade) due to the hair-growth, and haven't been in swimming-hall since then, which is sad since I love swimming... So the hair-growth is pretty much the symptom that bothers me the most.\\n\\nAnd for the last question; is it possible that having PCOS from a really young age, can effect your hormones in the level of attraction to another person?\\nI've yet to have even a small attraction to anyone, so it makes me wonder.\\n\\nThank you.\",\n",

After I was prescribed that medication, I FINALLY and quickly started losing the 40 pounds I had put on so rapidly.  Now I am back to a normal weight.  But I started developing whisker like hairs on my chin when I was in my late teens and it spread to my neck in my early twenties.  Now it is out of control and I have to tweeze and tweeze every day.  But it always feels rough like a mans face would feel after shaving, never smooth like a woman\\'s face should feel.  I wouldn\\'t want to take a razor to it (although I have before) because I\\'m afraid it will get worse.  I am embarrassed to let anyone touch my face and have swatted hands away from my face when someone tries to touch it for fear of being embarrassed.  These hairs are dark and thick and too many to really tweeze.\\nI also have a sort of all over peach fuzz on my face but it is lighter both in texture and color.\\nDoes anyone else have this problem and is there any creams or remedies you use that inhibit the growth?  I really don\\'t want to use birth control and I don\\'t think my insurance will cover anything so it would probably have to be an OTC type remedy.  I appreciate any suggestions.  Thanks!\\nI have the same exact issues.. I am like growing a mans goatee on my lip and chin.. I also have very thick side burns that connect with the goatee on the chin.. I use a mans norleco eletric razor every week to shave it off.. Words marvelous.. i did do 1 treatments of laser hair removal, but that was very expensive.. they charge like over 300 for 1 session. I wanted to try it out.. It worked, but i found out its not a permenant cure.. Once you stop paying and going to laser sessions your hair grows back.. Waste of money.. only a quick temporary solution.. i used to take metformin, but it made me go diahreea 30 times a day.. i have pcos and thyroid disease and insulin resistance..\\nI recommend electrolysis, I won\\'t lie it can be painful but it\\'s much cheaper than laser, depending on who you go to about $70 an hour. But it is permanent hair removal, and laser is NOT you will be throwing your money away for it to all grow back a year later.\\n\\nIf you want the hair to stop growing, spirolactone is a drug that controls testosterone levels which cause the hair growth. You may also need to look into other reasons you have this hair growth, if you are insulin resistant, maybe you need to be on metformin, you should also have your thyroid levels checked. You must see an endocrinologist, you shouldn\\'t have to live with this.\\nActually I am insulin resistant and I have been taking Metformin since 2000.  I believe Spirolactone is one of the medications that was prescribed to me by my gynocologist but my insurance wouldn\\'t cover it because it was for \"cosmetic reasons\" and not medically necessary.  I couldn\\'t afford to pay for it out of pocket as I really can\\'t afford many of the other methods of hair removal unfortunately.  Thanks for the suggestion though.\\nMaybe your dose of met isn\\'t high enough if your hair growth is that bad?\\nI think spiroloactone is also prescribed to lower blood pressure so it shouldn\\'t be seen as cosmetic. I think it\\'s just a couple of dollars even without insurance, if not make sure you check with Walmart or Target if it\\'s on their $4 plan. Look into spiro again it could really help with your excess hair growth.\\nI take 1000 mg of Metformin/day and I think it just right for me.  It took a long time for my body to get used to it.  I had diarrhea at first but it has finally stopped.\\nI might look into the Spiro again and see if it\\'s on the Walmart $4 plan.  I wish there was a good hair inhibiting cream that you could get OTC that would at least stop the hair from growing back so soon.\\nThanks again.\\n1000mg is a very low dose. Most endocrinologists don\\'t consider anything below 1500mg to be effective. That\\'s a shame your having a hard time with side effects on the drug, because it may not be a high enough dose to start shifting hormones. Are you on extended release? The side effects shouldn\\'t be as bad\\nYes I am on Metformin ER.  I find it easier on me to take one in the morning and one in the evening instead of taking both at the same time.  It has helped me with me with my cycles as far as making me more regular.  Before taking Metformin, I really had no way of knowing when I would get my period.  For a long time I would get them every three months.  They were very unpredictable because of my PCOD.  The Metformin has helped me immensely in that respect.\\ni have the same problem... but its like a full beard... like you, i used to tweeze for 2-3 hours every other day... and that became way too much for me... so i started using a nair product that was meant for the face... for me i experience leather feeling skin, rashes, and it didnt always remove all of the hairs. the bottle recomends you dont leave the product on for more than 5 minutes but i would leave it on for up to 20 because it would simply not remove it.  so now i have resorted to shaving. i do it every morning in the shower but i use a lotion as opposed to a shaving cream... it lessens that chance of razor burn.  i am on aldactone/spronolactone and have definately seen a difference.  this med is definately worth trying and it is on the $4 meds at kroger for sure.\\n\\nRe: I have excessive whisker-like hair on my face.

I intend on going to another Doctor to see if they will test me for more...\\nHave your testosterone levels tested. It's likely high if you have a lot of facial hair.\\n\\nIf you have a cyst on one of your ovaries and all those symptoms plus high testosterone levels it's most likely PCOS. If those levels ARE high, ask to be put on metformin and if you're not trying to get pregnant a BC pill like Yaz or Yasmin. Both lower your testosterone levels. I've been on metformin and Yasmin since mid feb, and I've lost weight and my testosterone levels are now normal and my physical PCOS symptoms are pretty much under control. I have an ultra sound on Friday to see if I have any ovarian cysts, which I'm pretty sure I do since my right ovary has had a sharp ache for some time.\\n\\nAnyway, get your testosterone levels tested, and ask for metformin if they're high!\\nHi ladies,\\n\\nI am a 42 year old woman.  I have had facial hair all of my life.  I am not talking just a little peel but serious facial hair on both my upper and lower lips, sides of my face, between the eyebrows and on the chin.  About a year and a half ago they found a 7 cm cyst on my left ovary and over 18 months it grew to around 9 cms so I recently had to have my left ovary and tube removed through surgery.\\n\\nAccording to my test results, my testosterone levels are normal as are my cortisol levels.  I am going to have them retested now that I have been almost two years off the birth control pill just to see if perhaps the pill was controlling my testosterone levels and now it is back to the way I was (the pill is known to bind testosterone and make it unavailable to your body .. I had a very high bound testosterone and a normal free testosterone level).  I did notice that while I was on the pill the hair growth was under control (I had most of it removed during high school through electrolysis) and now it is starting to crop up again.\\n\\nI do not think that just because you get ovarian cysts that you are PCOS.  Normally functioning women do get cysts on their ovaries every month.  These burst open to release an egg into our fallopian tubes every month (ovulation).  They are called follicular cysts (corpus luteum cysts after the eggs have been released) and are completely normal.  However, abnormal ovarian cysts also exist and if you are concerned, get an ultrasound.  Let me tell you that a doctor CANNOT feel a cyst if you are not extremely thin.  I had had several pelvic exams done by a few different doctors and none of them felt my 8 cm cyst.  I am not obese but I am, let's just say, not anorexic.  Only the ultrasound will tell you for sure what you have going on in the ovaries.  Try to go during your period for an external ultrasound.  This is when they are the least likely to see those normal follicular cysts (which end up worrying you for nothing .. ie.  is it a normal cyst ? or an abnormal one ? difficult to tell except perhaps by the size).\\n\\nKeep in mind that PCOS is not the only thing that causes high levels of testosterone in the blood.  There is also something called Non-Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia.  This involves your adrenal glands which also produce hormones.  The gold standard test for this is an ACTH-stimulation test with measurement of 17-hydroxyprogesterone at 60 minutes.  If this test comes out positive then you can confirm the diagnosis with a CYP21-gene mutation analysis.\\n\\nNon-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia is believed to be the most frequent monogenic autosomal recessive disorder in man and many people go undiagnosed because in men, for example, the only symptom is facial acne and we usually don't worry too much about this (men with facial hair is no big deal, right ?).  In women the main symptoms are hirsutism (facial hair), oligomennorrhoea (irregular periods) and acne.  Keep in mind that the treatment for this is the use of glucocorticoids (steroids).  I personally would not be willing to take these if I am confirmed with this condition (I am bringing this info to my next doctor's appointment to see if perhaps I can be tested ... just to know).  Steroids have all sorts of side effects and I would rather control my hirsutism and acne (I also have this) using other methods.\\n\\nNon classical Adrenal Hyperplasia is virtually indistinguishable from PCOS symptomatically so it is important to get tested and know exactly what you have.  Your cortisol levels can actually test normal and you can still have NCAH .. aldosterone should also be tested (my doctor only tested me for cortisol levels at one point).  NCAH is caused by a slight enzyme dysfunction and as a result you will have higher andogens in your blood (ie. testosterone).\\n\\nI hope that I have helped to shed some light on another possibility.  I think a lot of women are sent home being told that it is not PCOS and most doctors do not even know about NCAH.  Classic Adrenal Hyperplasia is diagnosed at birth because it is a life threatening condition but non classic AH can go undiagnosed forever because there is only a slight imbalance.  Doctors don't understand that even if we are not willing to pursue treatment (like myself), we would still like to know why we have certain symptoms.  In my case, my periods are very regular and after 20 years on the pill, extremely light.  I am fortunate in that respect.\\n\\nGood luck to you and I hope you get the answers you are looking for.  Don't freak out about cancer too much.  You are extremely young and it is very unlikely that you have cancer.  When I was diagnosed with my cyst, I too went through this.  Don't waste your energy.  Just get yourself tested and wait for the results to come in.\\n\\nTake care and all the best.\\n\\nEstria\",\n",

       " {'post': 'It\\'s not confirmed that I have PCOS, I\\'m 22 now and my periods were irregular as a teenager, aged 17 I developed a large ovarian cyst that had to be removed after several years, during this time my periods seem to stabalize a bit but there were many missed cycles, probably due to the cyst. Straight after this I went on the pill but came off it exactly a year ago. Since then, my periods have been regular (31 days) except from one cycle which came 5 days late. I was having a bit of ovary pain recently so went in for an ultrasound, there I was told everything was fine except my ovaries looked large which can be a sign of PCOS. I went back to my GP and he basically said it\\'s not worth investigating further, but that PCOS is a possibility. I know this isn\\'t right and I intend to see another GP who isn\\'t just out to save NHS costs. But in the meantime, I\\'m trying to figure out what I can for myself. So I\\'d be grateful if you would share your opinions on my questions.\\n\\nFirstly, does PCOS seem likely to you? I know some people can have regular periods with PCOS. I don\\'t really have any other symptoms, I\\'m 8 stone, no excess body hair (the only thing I can think of that would qualify is I get quite thick, black hairs below my belly button, and I wouldn\\'t expect them to be so dark).\\n\\nSecondly, I\\'ve been having libido problems for a year now. I\\'ve had my hormone levels checked and they came back fine (which is more confusion to the PCOS possibility). Same with thyroid function. But suddenly over the past week, my libido has just returned, and not only is it back but, and this might sound strange, my whole \\'area\\' just feels \\'healthy\\' again. It\\'s something I considered when I was having the problems - prior to the libido issues the skin and labia around my genital area was \\'soft\\' and moist, and for the past year it has felt dry and \\'rough\\'. Now it feels back to normal again. Suddenly now my cervix feels soft and moist too, before it always felt harder, and when my libido was around it felt softer at times too. I thought I might have been going mad and the whole libido thing was in my head until this happened, a big reminder of what it used to be like. But I can\\'t even enjoy it because I fear it might be temporary. I\\'ve got a theory in my head that my cycles over the past year have been annovulatory and that this one is one where I will ovulate (sort of the equivalent perhaps of someone with \\'fully fledged\\' PCOS getting a period after a year long absence). Could it be that my libido diminished because my body considered no ovulation as no point in wanting sex?\\n\\nI\\'m not due to ovulate for another week. I\\'m curious to know what point it is predestined a person will ovulate... is it from the start?\\n\\nSorry for the length/possible nonsense of this, I\\'m just trying to make sense of answers GPs aren\\'t willing to give.\\nHello Emma,\\n\\nI think you are very wise to find out information about the functioning of your body to supplement what the doctors are telling you.  Doctors are not trained to educate, only to treat according to the guidelines set down by their profession in their particular country.\\n\\nI can offer you some of the things that I have discovered recently.  You see, I am 42 years old and about a year and a half ago, they discovered a large ovarian cyst on my left ovary.  I am to have it removed by laparoscopy in a few weeks.  Ever since I began having problems with irregular bleeding at around the time they found this cyst, I started reading everything I could get my hands on on the subject.  The bleeding had nothing to do with the cyst but with long term use of the pill.  When I went off the pill, the bleeding stopped and my cycles went back to normal.  So anyway, that\\'s where I\\'m coming from on this issue.\\n\\nLibido is most definitely linked to your ovaries as they produce testosterone, the levels of which affect your libido.  Usually you are more likely to experience the \"softened\" cervix that you were speaking of and an increased libido about 14 days after the start of your period.  This is normally when you would be ovulating.  It may not necessarily be day 14 and could be anywhere between day 10 to day 14 or 15 etc.. When you are ovulating you may feel an increase in libido and your cervix will experience changes.  In addition, you may notice that your cervical mucus is thicker, sort of like the consistency of raw egg whites. This thicker mucus will occur both before and after ovulation due to hormone changes in your body.  You may wish to note when exactly you are experiencing things starting from day one of your next period.  Your cervix will also change around the time you start your period.  I can usually feel my period coming on due to this.\\n\\nYou should also know that the pill has an effect on libido.  In your body you have two types of testosterone, bound and free.  The bound testosterone is floating around but is not available for your body to use.  The free testosterone is what your body uses.  Therefore, this free testosterone is what is most important in regards to your libido.  The pill is now known to bind testosterone and not make it available to your body.  They are not sure that this is reversible.  Since you were not on the pill for long then I doubt that too much changes have occurred but you never know.  It may be worth having your testosterone levels checked several times over a cycle.  In my case, I had slightly elevated levels of testosterone when I was younger (I am also hirsute .. facial hair mostly) so the pill may have helped me.  As a matter of fact, now that I have been off the pill for about a year and a half, I have noticed that I have more facial acne and facial hair has begun to sprout up again (back to the electrolysis clinic I go).  Facial acne and facial hair may both signify increased levels of testosterone.  I also feel a very strong libido around ovulation and I KNOW exactly when I am ovulating (I get pain during this time .. perhaps due to my ovarian cyst, I don\\'t know).  When I was on the pill my libido was practically non existent.  I can therefore attest personally to the fact that the pill has an effect on libido, although this may not be the same for every woman.\\n\\nI hope I have helped to shed some more light on your issue.  I think you are wise to see another doctor regarding your enlarged ovaries.  It may be nothing at all but perhaps you are prone to developing larger than normal follicular cysts during your monthly cycles, who knows.  An intravaginal ultrasound should be able to give you more information on this.\\n\\nAll the best.\\n\\nEstria\\nThanks for replying. Yes, I know about the signs of ovulation, but it would be extremely unusual for me to be ovulating this early. That\\'s what\\'s thrown me.\\n\\nI\\'ve read alot too about many things related to the reproductive tract. Given that my cyst went undiagnosed for 3 years despite its size, I had plenty of time to do this!\\n\\nI\\'m not really sure what\\'s going on. I think the best thing for the time being is probably to chill out about it. And I did have a transvaginal ultrasound at my last appointment, but all they detailed was that the ovaries looked large and an odd shape, no cysts or anything.\\nBy the way, I was on the combined pill for only about 4 months, before I went on the progesterone only pill... would this \\'bind\\' the testosterone? I was only on HBC in total for about 7 months.\\nHi,\\n\\nI think that you should try to find out why your ovaries are enlarged and an \"odd\" shape.  Enlarged ovaries are normally due to cysts that are inside of them.  If the ultrasound was not very helpful then perhaps another type of scan such as a CAT scan might give more information.\\n\\nDoing some hormonal testing through an endocrinologist might also be very helpful.  Hormones change a lot so you would need to have more than just one test in order to see what is going on.\\n\\nI do not believe that 7 months is enough time for the pill to have any effect on your testosterone.  I believe that the binding effect occurs only with long term use of the pill.  The only way to know this is to test your testosterone levels .. for example, when mine were tested, I had a normal free testosterone and quite a high bound testosterone level.  I do know that when I was a child, the doctors had tested me and found my testosterone to be high (I am assuming they meant the free T) so I am guessing that the pill did have an effect.  However, I was on the pill for over 20 years so this is quite different than 7 months.\\n\\nI would not freak out over it but I would definitely try to follow up the ultrasound to get more information about what was found. Saying that the ovaries are enlarged and odd shaped is rather vague and would indicate further investigation.\\n\\nHope you get an answer soon.\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nEstria\\n\\nP.S. Sometimes ovulation does not occur right on schedule.  Occasionally I do have early ovulation.  Sometimes women may even ovulate twice in one cycle.  This is how you get fraternal twins which come from two different eggs (!)\\nThe thing is, when I had my cyst removed it was by laporotomy so I would\\'ve thought that should my ovaries be full of cysts, it would have been noted in surgery? I never received any feedback on the size of my ovaries, just that they were both left in tact following the operation.\\n\\nIt\\'s really frustrating always feeling like something is wrong. I\\'m going to make an appointment with a doctor tomorrow and hopefully find some answers.\\n\\nThanks again for your replies, they\\'re extremely helpful.\\nHi Emma,\\n\\nGood luck with the doctor.  Be persistent and make it obvious that you DO want to know what is going on.  Sometimes doctors assume that we will put our health and lives in their hands blindly.  My doctor always has a copy ready for me of any scans or tests that I have recently had.  He knows now that I will insist on getting all of the information about my health and that I want to be the one who decides what is best for me.\\n\\nI guess we sometimes have to train medical professionals how to treat us.\\n\\nAll the best and I hope you get some answers very soon.\\n\\nEstria',\n",

       " {'post': 'how can i get pregnant having psos\\nHas your doctor given you any recommendations?  There is ovarian drilling and medication such as metformin.  As I quoted in another post, I didnt do the ovarian drilling due to scar tissue causing me more trouble.  I was prescribed metformin twice a day (it does take your body awhile, me 3mths, to get use to it and feel okay) and I was pregnant 5 months later and now have a healthy 13 month old son.  Dont give up, try whatever is best for you and I wish you the best.  It can happen.\\nI was diagnosed with PCOS after trying for a year to get pregnant, and was sent for ovarian drilling.

We were TTC for over 2 years. I have PCOS. Here\\'s what worked for me:\\n1- I joined Weight Watchers in Sept. \\'08 and lost 30 pounds by Feb. \\'09.\\n2- I switched from regular milk to Soy milk (get the original one it tastes great!) this helps to regulate insulin levels which is a problem for certain PCOS women even if, like me, they don\\'t have diabetes.\\n3-In Feb. \\'09 my OB/GYN inserted the tip of a  long swab in my cervix to open it up. He calls this an \"Egg Test\". He said my cervix opening was really small & tight. This procedure really hurt but thankfully only lasted 30 seconds. I couldn\\'t see the relation with my PCOS ovaries and this test but my DR. said to trust him and 2 months later I got pregnant!\\n4-After the Egg Test I started taking 1 capsule of Red Clover Each day after 2 weeks I took 2/day.\\n--Before you take anything consult your Dr. to make sure it\\'s safe for you\\n--My ob/gyn said that not all doctors believe in the \"egg test\" but he does and it works 80% of the time. It has to be done 21 days after your last period and you must have protected sex between these 21 days.\\n\\nGood luck / I know what you\\'re going through\\n',\n",

       " {'post': \"Let me start by saying I have been diagnosed with PCOS for a little over a year. My periods stopped after the birth of my third chid a little over 5 years ago. After I had him I had a problem sleeping at night and what better to do when you are up late than eat lol so I ended up gainind about 30 pounds and I was a far cry from skinny to begin with. So I ended at 225 pounds. Since the birth of my son I have had alot of abdominal issues, upper abdominal bloating, it looks like the right side of my stomach is swollen bigger than the left, and lots of abdominal pain, sometimes going up into my chest. I have lost a good deal of weight (down to 198) and still losing. My question is, does anyone else have this same issue with the severe bloat and belly pain and can it be caused by hormonal issues? I have had to take progesterone to induce periods for the past 3 years and I have noticed that right after my period my belly feels better for a week or two and then everything swells back up again and I am miserable. I have had my gallbladder checked and it is fine so I am getting kinda worried. Also the weight I have lost, none seems to have left my belly, I haven't even dropped a pants size. Anyone else with these symptoms it would be great to hear from you so that maybe I could quit worrying myself sick over it.\\n\\n\\n\\nHi Jess\\n\\nMy situation is a bit different, I have no idea what is wrong with me, PCOS was one thought I had but I can't get any doctors to pay attention to what i'm saying. I have periods that come too frequently, every 20 days or so from the start of the last one, and no pain when I get them.\\n\\nWhat I do have similar to you is the abdominal issues. I've gained 15-20 pounds so far over the last 2 months which for me is not normal at all, i've been eating even healthier than I was before the weight gain and exercising a lot more doing strength training, yoga and cardio until the pain in my right side gets so bad I have to stop. Now granted the cardio is just power walking and stepping but i've been feeling too sick to do anything more strenuous, but it's way more exercise than I was doing before I started putting on the weight. Yet i've gained 15-20 pounds and it's not all muscle weight because my pants just keep getting tighter. I was around 142 before the weight gain and now i'm almost at 160. 145  pounds was the most i've ever weighed in my life before all this.\\n\\nMy symptoms started about 8 months ago with occasional nausea that turned to  nightly nausea a few weeks later and then turned to constant nausea about a week after that, then also came an annoying pain right underneath my right ribcage that felt like someone had hit me there with a baseball bat, the pain sometimes reaches around to my back, then came a full swollen feeling underneath the right rib that has continually gotten worse, now it feels hard there too and I can't sleep on my stomach anymore because of the pain. Throughout all of this i've also had bouts of dizziness, night sweats, diarrhea and constipation, horrible stomach cramping, itchiness, leg swelling and leg pains...and I know i'm forgetting more.\\n\\nAnd as far as I can tell all the weight gain has been in my belly and hip/upper thigh area. Ultrasound of my gallbladder area came back fine but they found a small possible hemangioma on my liver which they say is not causing my pain, but my symptoms seem to match those of  asymptomatic people with the same problem, and I really don't know what is going on with my body.\\n\\nI know it doesn't help that I don't have an answer but you are not alone.

I never thought it would happen again. The only thing I did that was different was take multivitamins and Inositol and started reflexology, I also followed alow GI diet. If these are the only things I changed and I fell pregnant after all those years then it must be one or all these things that worked.\\nIt's worth a try. Good luck. I know what your going through.\\nJust a bit curious on the metphormin. Will it cause your cycle to be messed up? Mine was fine until i went to the doctor and they put me on metphormin. I'm not understanding this pcos very well. Have on known for about it for about two and a half months i have been trying to get pregnant for about two years now\\nChris: metformin is known for not causing lows. It makes your cells less resistant to insulin, which goes hand in hand with PCOS. It also doesn't cause weight gain. For all these reasons it's considered a first line treatment for T2 diabetes. A good friend of mine is a T1 diabetic and has been on metformin for about 6 months because of her PCOS. She was taking a lot of insulin because she had quite a bit of resistance there, and the metformin got rid of the resistance, so she takes less insulin.\\n\\nWhen T2 diabetics are put on metformin, they have to follow a strict diet because it, in itself won't cause low blood sugar so they need to be very careful with what they eat. Once you're put on other medications and/or insulin then you have a bit more freedom because those treatments WILL cause your blood sugars to go low.\\n\\nMy best advice is to bring your concerns to your doctor about this, but you should be fine to take it without worrying about low blood sugars. Perhaps a test to see how resistant you are to insulin may help put your mind at ease (if you're not resistant you may not need metformin).\\nI have PCOS and also take Metformin. My endocronologist put me on it when I was 16 and my blood sugar dropped to below 30 so I took myself off it. Once I was older, my family doctor tried it again and everything is fine now. I asked my current doctor if there was a reason to continue it (I still have a weight and hair side affect from the PCOS and don't notice any physical differences). He told me that the basic reason to give PCOS women Metformin is to help prevent the cysts on ovaries. Some also have an insulin issue that it may help as well.\",\n",

I don't have acne, or any of the other systems that usually are related to PCOS, however I do suffer with my weight because of that, and with ovulation and my periods is so iregular.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll the best\\nBianca\\nBianca\\nYeah I pretty much have all of them although my blood pressure is not high enough to be medicated. I am on my 3rd mirena and they have been a life saver for me. I had a daughter way before PCOS diagnosis and had mirena fitted. I used to have terrible heavy periods and they stopped completely. No pain no bleeding for about 12yrs now. I was only diagnosed PCOS last Nov. Why have they suggested Mirena as I don't think it has any benefits for PCOS unless unusually like me you have terrible time of the month. They are a little uncomfortable to fit but other than that I have had no problems. I know some people have awful stories but for me it has been great. Any questions, plz ask, take care,\\n\\nr12las\\n\\nBiana and R12las: Thanks for the encouragement. I think they are wanting me to get the Mirena IUD because I don''t want to get pregnant for another year and a half while I finish nursing school. They said that it would be ok for a woman with PCOS because it's progesterone only and in very low doses. I did some research but got some conflicting info about whether it improves PCOS or doesn't do anything or makes it worse. I have tried Chinese herbalists, acupuncturists and homeopathy before. Nothing seems to work -- it was all a waste of money. When I was on Glucophage/Metformin for a few months the symptoms of PCOS were better but it gave me really bad GI symptoms. I hated it. I've been on so many different variations of progesterone, from Provera to Aygestin, the patch and depo-provera. They all gave me problems and would also stop working. It's all pretty discouraging. I haven't been on anything in a while and on top of that, I gained about 10 pounds after my move up to SF 2 years ago. I was already trying to lose 30 pounds before that. Yeah, so I really need to lose like 40 pounds. It's good old fashioned calorie reduced diet and exercise for me. I am not eligible for the lap band or a gastric bypass, but sometime I almost wish I were just so the weight would come off faster. It is soooo hard! Any tips or recommendations on PCOS or weight reduction would be great. Thanks.\\n\\nsapphiredara\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hello all!  A few months ago I was diagnosed with PCOS (after randomly going to the doctor about having trouble losing weight).  I thought it was crazy at first.  I thought maybe I just had the syndrome with no cysts or anything like that.  Well, they sent me for an ultrasound and it turns out I have a 14cm cyst with, apparently, something about the echo readings that required further testing.  So I had an abdominal CT scan done, and then a pelvic exam by my GYN (she said it was \"impressive\"...yikes!).  Well, I just got the results back from the CT scan and they said the \"pelvic mass\" required further evaluation, so they\\'ve scheduled me for an MRI.  I\\'m supposed to have a laparatomy next month.\\n\\nI\\'m getting a little nervous about all of this...to have gone from one month thinking everything was fine in the world to learning I have PCOS and could potentially have all kinds of problems, to finding out I have this enormous cyst, then to have all these tests, including all kinds of blood tests.\\n\\nI\\'m just wondering what all these tests could mean...if anyone has any ideas?  The CT scan and MRI have both been ordered by the staff after briefly talking to me on the phone, so I haven\\'t had a chance yet to talk to my GYN about what they\\'re looking for.  I\\'m 27, so I know the chance of it being cancerous are small, but I don\\'t know.  Why would they need an ultrasound and a CT and an MRI?  Any help would be great.  I\\'m trying to stay positive and not worry too much, but it\\'s getting hard.\\n\\nSabriste\\nSabriste,\\n\\nHave they also ordered a blood test called the CA-125 ?  This is a test that looks for a specific cancer antigen that is usually present in high numbers when ovarian cancer is present.  35 and under is normal.  Unfortunately, premenopausal women have a greater chance of having either a false positive (where you score high and there is no cancer) or a false negative (where you score normal and there is stage 1 ovarian cancer) than post menopausal women.  However, this can nevertheless be a source of additional information and I am rather surprised that your doctors have not requested this test.\\n\\nUsually the ultrasound is the gold standard for ovarian cysts and the only reason I can think of to do the MRI would be to check out the rest of that area and be sure there is nothing that the ultrasound may have missed.  I am not sure why they would call for both a CT scan AND an MRI so perhaps you should ask your doctor about this.\\n\\nWas the ultrasound that you had an external ultrasound or an intravaginal one ?  If it was external, you should get an internal one so that they can get a closer and clearer look at the cyst AND they can do a doppler flow analysis where they see if there is any blood flow to the cyst (cancerous lesions usually have what is called angiogenesis where they create bloodflow connections .. a lesion with no blood flow is less likely to be cancerous).  The CA-125 and the doppler flow will definitely give them more information on this growth (oh and don\\'t worry, I think they refer to almost anything as a mass .. it\\'s a worrisome term for us patients but quite general as far as medical terms go .. it can still be a benign mass).\\n\\nYou are right in that someone of your age is very unlikely to have ovarian cancer.  Most cases occur in women around the 60 age range.  However, there are more benign forms of ovarian cancer that may affect younger women.  For example, a borderline cancer is usually removed and the situation is completely cured (no chemo necessary as it grows extremely slowly).  Other cancer cell types are also less invasive and have a 95% cure rate.  These are also quite rare but you should be aware of them.\\n\\nBy the way, if cancer is at all suspected, you absolutely NEED to have this surgery done by a gynecological oncologist.  These gynecologists are specially trained in this field and should, God forbid, cancer be present, they can take the proper precautions during the surgery.  For example, they know exactly how to perform such a procedure so that there is no spillage of the cyst (they use a bag before aspirating the cyst).  Gyne oncologists do a special fellowship in this field and are much better trained at removing sinister growths so MAKE SURE that the person doing this surgery has the proper training.  If cancer is not suspected then a regular gyne is just fine.\\n\\nSabriste, you have to understand that even very large cysts such as yours are quite common, even in younger women.  The likelihood that it is something dangerous is extremely small.  I am however wondering how on earth they diagnosed you with PCOS if you only have the one very large cyst ???  PCOS usually involves a chain (or necklace) of small cysts on the ovaries, irregular menses (periods), blood pressure and cholesterol problems, sometimes diabetes and yes, difficulty in loosing weight (but more likely the weight issue is related to that large cyst which carries some weight with it).  If the only problem you have is the difficulty in loosing weight then this is not enough for a PCOS diagnosis.  Perhaps you should ask about this as well.\\n\\nI hope that everything goes well at your scans and at your laparotomy.  If you wish, you can take a look at my post from around the 8th of May regarding my laparoscopy experience for the removal of my left ovary and tube (due to a 9 cm cyst).  It is not quite the same type of procedure but the prep is basically the same.  It may be helpful to you and perhaps offer you some encouragement.\\n\\nTake good care of yourself and try not to worry.  They will take this thing out and you will be back to normal in absolutely no time at all.\\n\\nAll the best.\\n\\nEstria\\nEstria,\\n\\nThank you so much for your reply!  It was so informative and helpful...I really appreciate you taking the time to write that!\\nSorry too for not replying sooner...I\\'ve not been feeling well this last week or so and haven\\'t been on the computer much at all.\\n\\nThey actually diagnosed me with PCOS before they found the cyst.  I had some blood tests done and they found out that my LH and FSH levels were out of whack...one of them was twice as high as the other which apparently was a flag for PCOS.  That\\'s when they ordered the ultrasound that found the cyst.  She didn\\'t say if there were cysts or not on my right ovary, just that it wasn\\'t concerning...she was focused more on the other side.\\n\\nI think my GYN ordered the blood test you mentioned, because when I went to see her yesterday she said they had no reason to think it was cancerous.  I didn\\'t know about the false negatives...I wonder if I should ask her about that?  But it turns out that I also have endometriosis....and apparently the cyst is an endometrioma.  I think that may have been the reason to do an MRI, so they could see if there are adhesions....?  I\\'m not sure.  I will hopefully have those results tomorrow.\\n\\nI was wondering if this changes things as far as what I can expect from surgery?  I\\'ve seen so many different things...some places say that endometriomas can be drained and removed laproscopically, but others say that cysts this large need to be taken out whole by laparotomy.  My GYN didn\\'t say anything about changing the plan to do a laparotomy.\\n\\nAnother problem I just found out I have is that my pituitary gland apparently releases too much prolactin.  My (regular) doctor thinks that maybe this is what caused the whole ovarian problem in the first place (as well as other problems I\\'ve been having, like migraines and other things).  So now I have to go in for another MRI to make sure the gland is normal sized.  *sigh*  God knows what will happen if it\\'s not!  But I\\'ll cross that bridge when I come to it.\\n\\nThanks again for your support and all your help!\\n\\nSabriste\\nHi Sabriste,\\n\\nWhat a coincidence, I was just taking a glance and there was your message.\\n\\nI would not worry about the endometrioma.  If this is what they think it is then this is harmless and they probably want to make sure there aren\\'t any others in your abdomen that need to be addressed by the surgery as well.  I doubt that a mass of that size can be taken out laparoscopically and a laparotomy would be a much safer surgery for you under the circumstances.\\n\\nAs for the pituitary gland, this is perhaps what is causing the imbalance of Luteinizing Hormone and Follicle Stimulating Hormone that you mentioned.  If they find that your pituitary gland is not producing the correct amounts of different hormones, you can take medication to regulate this, depending upon what is out of balance.\\n\\nI am sure that you will be just fine.  It is better to fix this when you are young then to go through life having problems and not knowing why.  It is also good to regulate this problem early if you wish to have children in the future.\\n\\nDo let us know how everything goes and all the best for the surgery.  I am sure that your recovery will be swift.  All the best.\\n\\nEstria\\nThanks again for the reply and the support, Estria!  I am scheduled to have surgery on August 11, so hopefully it will all go well.  I\\'m certainly ready to get it done...I never really had much pain that I paid any attention to (I just ignored it or thought it was normal, I guess?), but it\\'s been getting progressively worse and now I get really bad pains that make it hard to walk upright.  My Dr. prescribed me Darvocet for the pain, but unfortunately I can only take it when I don\\'t have to drive anywhere, so that means I have to pretty much just deal with it during the day and wait until I get home from work in the afternoon to get some relief.  Oh well.\\n\\nI was wondering if anyone who\\'s had a cyst like this has experienced real abdominal fatigue after doing any kind of physical activity?  Just this last week or so, if I do anything like clean, do dishes, vacuum, anything of that sort, even for just ten minutes or so, when I stop my abdominal region feels like I\\'ve just done an intense abs-toning routine.  Literally.  I mean, my abdomen is *exhausted* and feels tight and very achy, and I feel just generally worn out.  I feel so useless because I can\\'t do a lot of chores, and I\\'m trying to help out my mother who just broke her wrist and can\\'t do a lot of chores for herself.  Yeah, this has been one crazy summer.\\n\\nAnyway, thanks again!\\n\\nSabriste\\nHello Sabriste,\\n\\nHang in there and that annoying thing will be history very soon.  Your fatigue may also be due to your pituitary imbalance so you will need to have this checked out at some point so that they can regulate this problem.\\n\\nTry to take it easy as much as possible prior to the surgery.  A 14 cm cyst is quite large and yes this may be putting some pressure on your back perhaps.  For the discomfort, you may want to try an anti-inflammatory such as Advil or Motrin.  A heating pad also does wonders (if your job does not involve too much running around).  Watch out for those pain killers as they can constipate (after surgery, be sure to take some metamucil, which is psillium fibre, or a stool softener and eat plenty of fibre ... spinach and other green veggies, prunes etc.. ... also, it is extremely important to drink plenty of water with this).\\n\\nWhen I had my cyst, I would experience spasm like pains from time to time.  I no longer have these since the surgery so I can only assume that they were caused when the cyst grew a little and stretched the ovarian tissue.  My cyst was only about 9 cms so I did not have the fatigue episodes that you describe.  Listen to your body and if you are tired, rest.  See if you can get someone else to help out besides your mom.\\n\\nAll the best for the surgery next month.  I am sure you will come through will flying colours and I am VERY sure that you will be extremely happy to be rid of that cyst (as I was).\\n\\nTake care of  yourself.\\n\\nEstria',\n",

Before the birth of my last child I had never had a problem with my periods. I have been pregnant 4 times (2nd pregnany had a miscarrage) but all my other pregnancys went great with no problems trying to concieve. I have always been overweight,I weighed 185 when I concieved my last child. However, after having him my weight steadily climbed and I topped at 225 about 8 months after he was born.

I have been with PCOS since I was a teenager after the birth of my first son (15 when I had him), I was not diagnosed though til I was about 19 and I am now 33. With my first husband we tried to concieve again and then for some reason not very many docs new about PCOS and how to treat it. I went yrs without a period until a new dr gave me progesteron (I dnt know how to spell it\\n) and I had my first period fir the first time in yrs! I took that for about a yr every 3 months to shed my lining and have one. I then lost insurance so I went without again for along time. We then split and went through a divorce and with all the stress I lost weight (from 187 to 140) in a matter of months. I then started to have periods on my own gradually and it was like WOW! I then met my 2nd husband and after all the yrs of trying to concieve with the 1st hubby we got pregnant and I miscarried after 6-8 weeks, I then concieved again and carried my little girl to 22 weeks and had a premature birth due to the PCOS and my cervix is weak. 2 months later I then got pregnant again and my dr now knew what to do and I carried all the way and have a beautiful son. Losing weight helped contribute to all this for me, I am now having symptoms again as I put the weight back on after his birth and dr just put me on metformin and yaz BC so I can regulate my side effects and have periods again. Losing weight is a big factor but its sooo hard to lose with this condition!! I wish you the best of luck as I am too trying to lose again to have my periods normally!\\n\\nMyboysmylife\\n',\n",

       " {'post': \"My 32 yr old dtr in law was diagnosed with a complex ovarian cyst with a septum 7cm.  She had a Ca125 drawn.  If it is elevated she will be referred to an oncologist.  If it is not, she will have it removed next week.  She and my son are very worried.  Has anyone had experience with this/\\nThanks for your replies.  ellen\\nHello Ellen,\\n\\nMost cysts, even complex ones, are benign so try to relax until you have more information.  The reason that they usually take out complex cysts is because if cancer is present it usually looks like a complex cyst or a solid tumour.  HOWEVER, the large percentage of complex cysts are completely benign.\\n\\nKeep in mind that even if your daughter in law's CA-125 is elevated this DOES NOT necessarily mean that she has cancer.  This test is notoriously unreliable and can sometimes be elevated due to benign reasons such as being on your period or endometriosis.  The way the cyst looks on the ultrasound is often the best indicator prior to surgery and radiologists are quite good at seeing what is cancer and what isn't.  Needless to say, the cyst will have to come out in order to be sure.\\n\\nMy sister in law was terrified when they discovered she had a 12 cm septated complex cyst that took up BOTH of her ovaries.  Her CA-125 was elevated and she went to see a gynecological oncologist who performed the surgery (under these circumstances you really need an oncologist in case it DOES end up being cancer and more aggressive surgery is necessary).  After all of this anxiety it turned out to be a perfectly benign growth although she did loose one ovary due to the cyst.\\n\\nMy cousin has had cysts all of her life and when she was only 20 years of age one of the cysts twisted her ovary and cut off the blood supply so that she ended up loosing an ovary.  Despite this, she had two beautiful children.  She recently began to develop complex cysts on her other ovary and decided to have the other ovary removed in order to prevent having to go in and out of surgery (she had already had other cysts removed from this ovary).  The cysts were benign and now she is in surgical menopause at the age of 32.\\n\\nI myself have an 8 cm fluid filled cyst on my left ovary and was worried sick that it may be cancer.  They found it last September and I have kept an eye on it ever since.  I did have the CA-125 done and mine came out at 7 (anything under 35 is considered normal).  If my cyst begins to grow or change in any way, I will have to have a laparoscopy to remove it and possibly my left ovary as well.  I am not happy at the prospect but I have accepted the situation ( more or less\\n).\\n\\nOvarian cysts are EXTREMELY common occurences, even complex ones so don't worry unless you have something to worry about (and you probably don't).\\n\\nAll the best and come back and tell us how your daughter in law is doing.\\nDear Estria - Thank you so much for your informative reply.  I am a 23 yr- breast cancer survivor, and I know about the waiting for concrete information.  I will definitely share your info with my son and dtr in law - it will give them some positive thoughts as they wait it out.  I am very grateful that you took the time to write.\\nellen\\nAn update - the Ca125 came back 25, which is encouraging even though I know there are false positives and negatives.  My dtr in law is scheduled for surgery Aug 7 for cyst removal and possible ovary removal as well.  Hoping for good path results there, too.\\nHello Sanell,\\n\\nI am glad that the CA-125 results were encouraging.  Usually if this result is sky high (in the hundreds) it raises a red flag and this is obviously not your case.\\n\\nI believe that they usually perform a frozen biopsy of the cyst during surgery to ensure that nothing more needs to be done other than to take it out.  The decision as to whether or not the ovary remains depends, of course, upon the biopsy and upon whether the cyst has compromised the ovary.  There is also the concern that another cyst may return in the future (if it happened once ..) so depending upon fertility issues etc.. things will have to be discussed with her doctor.  After the concern for cancer has been ruled out, this last issue is what annoys me the most.  I am a believer in keeping as many of my body parts as possible but the idea of having to return for a second operation if the cyst returns really ticks me off so if I need to have surgery I will have to face this issue.\\n\\nI hope your daughter in law comes through like a trooper.  Take care and all the best to her for a speedy recovery.\\nThis has been a CRAZY month for me.  I went to my gen care phys for abdominal pain.  She was having me checked for Pancreatitis..etc blood work and scans on my abdomen and in my rib area.  Randomly they found a large cyst on my left ovary. Sent me to my Gyno. They talked of removing but wanted to wait till after I ovulated to see what it did.  I went back for another scan and they said good news/bad news.  You dont have a cyst but you have a mass in your bladder!\\n\\nThe urologist I went to basically told me I had cancer.  He did a scope through my urethra and said no bladder cancer, but something is pushing in on your bladder.  He sent me back to the Gyno.\\n\\nMy Gyno told me that because of the large complex cyst and mass on my ovary, they thought the ovary was the bladder! ( yes they did refind the cyst!) The did the laproscopy surgery and removed the cyst and the mass and now here I sit and wait!  I am nervous, but they said the mass was free floating.  I am just guessing that is a good sign?\\n\\nBut all the woman in my family have had cancer.  Does this sound familiar to anyone?  Sorry I had to go on and on....\\nHello Jordie,\\n\\nSorry to hear about all of these problems you are having.  Perhaps posting this story on its own thread might get you more responses.\\n\\nYes I believe that if a mass is moveable it is a better sign than if it is not.  Also, I imagine that they got the entire thing out and that they did not see any others in your abdomen.  This is also a great sign because it means that the mass (cyst?) was self contained.  Keep in mind that the majority of these growths are benign so try not to worry unless you really have something to worry about (boy is that ever easy to say and difficult to do, right ?).  I am learning that due to the ovaries' reproductive capabilities, there are over 100 different types of ovarian cysts that are possible.  This is what makes this ovarian cyst issue so complicated.\\n\\nI know very well how the watchful waiting game can really eat up your quality of life.  Try to keep yourself occupied with something you really love to do in the meantime.  It will help to take your mind off of the waiting.\\n\\nAll the best and let us know how everything works out for you.\\n\\nEstria\",\n",

I was talking with a woman in grocery store today, and her daughter was exactly the same way at a young age, and was diagnosed with PCOS in her teens.\\nAnother contributing factor I have read in my google searches is that PCOS may come from the fathers side of the family and early balding was a symptom in the father, which her father does have.\\nMy daughter has not started menstrating yet, but it looks like it may be soon. She does get dandruff (another symptom?), but not until recently. She is getting pretty chunky around the middle.\\nSoooo....with the hormonal mood swings since birth, the gestational diabetes, the dandruff, the chunkiness, the fathers balding, my history of diabetes, my sisters cervical cancer, the spoilt rotten mood swings,...can this all add up to early signal signs of PCOS?\\nI am going to take her to the doctor, but I am wondering if there is any parents out there of 10 year olds that may have some insight?\\n\\nThanks so much\\n\\nLeanne\\ni have pcos and i didn't have any of the symptoms that you desribed. and i was not diagnosed with pcos until i was 24 and trying to conceive. i don't think it's even possible to diagnose a child that young with pcos. people who have this condition have trouble with ovulation and since she's not menstruating yet i'm not sure how you came to this conclusion. maybe you can have her doctor do a blood test and check for hormonal imbalances. that might give you a better idea of what she has.\\nby the way, your gestational diabetes will have no affect on her having pcos. i am pregnant right now and have it and my diabetes education nurse told me that it won't affect my baby in that way. good luck.\\nIm a mother of two girls and i can relate to what your going through with ur 10yr old.Both of my girls have are deffinetly semilar and had the same problems.We were told many times that there was nothing wrong and after never giving up and finally taking them to an IVF clinic and testing them for PCOS we came to find out that is what the have had since the oldest was 9 now she is 16 and the youngest had it since she was 10 and is now 13 even though she had not started her cycle and they are still not regular.They have both been on medication for 3 monhs and we are still trying to get the rite dosage of medication.We will find out more when we go back tp the doctor in september.It takes nothing more than blood work if correct tests are ordered.Hope this helps and best of luck and dont give up!\",\n",

       " {'post': '\\n\\nI don\\'t have pcos but I have read that mangosteen juice can really help.  You must drink it everyday until the symptoms abate.  I\\'m sure that noni does the same thing.cb\\nHello!  I just wanted to tell you about my pcos to see if you could be any help to the situation I am in.   Last Sept. I was diagnosed with pcos and my doctor put me on metformin. For the first 3 months of taking it I still no period. He then put me on a progesteron pill and that did work.  A few months after taking that my husband and I decided we wanted to start ttc so he put me on clomid for cycle days 5-9, I did ovulate but no luck on getting pregnant.  The only thing was, was that my period was coming one week after ovulation instead of 2 weeks.  My doctor wasn\\'t too thrilled with that and said he would need to consult with some other doctors to see what we should do. So this month he is wanting me to take the clomid and then come in for an internal ultrasound to see what my eggs looked like if there were any and to also take blood work to see what me hormones were doing.  This coming Friday 8/1/08, is when I am going in for the tests.  He is thinking that what we should do is take the clomid and then follow up with progesterone to hold my period off until the 28th day of my cycle.  I guess my question for you is, did you experience anything like this?  It seems like it is such a complicated disease to have because so many girls have different symptoms.  And for me, I am a 5-1 woman and weigh 110, so for me it\\'s not about losing weight to help with my symptoms, its just getting my hormones in check.\\n\\n\\nI wanted to tell you my experience with PCOS.  I was officially diagnosed when I was 21 yrs old.  I have had problems prior, that required me to go to the hospital.  I was always told that I had folical cysts.  They would give me a shot to cause the cyst to burst and send me home.  No one ever said anything about PCOS.\\n\\nMy husband and I got married when I was 17.  We waited two years to try and concieve.  I went to my DR for my annual exam, that we had been trying to conceive with no luck.  He did some testing.  We meet a month later to discuss the result.  From the results of my test as well as my family history I diagnosed with PCOS.\\n\\nSee my Mother had problem at a young age with Cysts and Fibroid Tumors.  That resulted in her undergoing the LEAP procedure at 26 yrs of age and a full hysterectomy by 29 yrs.\\n\\nWell my DR put me on Clomid.  He started me out at 1 pill a day for 5 days.  Then next cycle I went to 2 and by 6 months I was a 5 pills a day.  I went through several blood test during this time, because I was display pregnancy symptoms (a side effect of the Clomid).  Then at about 8 month after startinf Clomid I was sent to have my progesterone checked.  A few days later I got a call from my DR office telling me \"IT\\'S GOOD\".  A question my progesterone level is good.  She said No it\\'s a good pregnancy.  I was excited and confused at the same time.  See by that time I was starting to spot (I thought it was just my normal monthly).  She had me come in right away, and I was started on Progesterone.  Luckly 9 months later I gave birth to a healthy baby girl.\\n\\nThen about a year later I told my DR that I thought I might be pregnant.  He told me that was impossible.  I would not be able to get pregnant without Clomid.  To my surprise, a monthly later it was confirmed I was pregnant.  Without using Clomid.  However this pregnancy do not go a smoothly.  I went into preterm labor a 6 months.  I had dialated 2 cm and full efaced.  I was placed on complete bed rest.  However I still had my son 1 month early.  I am blessed though, with the exception a severe Guandice, He was healthy.  Needless to say I\\'m doing with pregnancy.\\n\\nToday my Daughter is 6 and my son will be 4.  I am facing new challanges now.  I am getting ready to turn the big 3-0.  I went to my DR a couple of months ago again for my annual.  After my exam he wanted to discuss his findings.  He gave me 4 choices.\\n\\n1. An IUD to try and control the PCOS (since I suffer w/ Migraine the Pill is out of the question).  I told me NO!!!\\n\\n2. An Endometrial Ablation, but this would only help with my cycle not w/ the PCOS.  And it would only put off a Hysterectomy for another 5 years.\\n\\n3. A COMPLETE Hysterectomy, this is the only thing that would work because the source of my problems is in my ovaries.\\n\\n4. Do nothing and see where I am in 6 months.\\n\\nI have discussed my option with my Husband, and we are leaning toward the Hysterectomy.  We don\\'t plan to have anymore children, and go through to medical procedures when one can take care of it all.\\n\\nI pray that you don\\'t have to go through the same ordeal as I have.  And if You or anyone else has any advise for me I would love to hear it.\\n\\nCurrent Symptoms:\\n\\n1 - Inability to loss weight\\n2 - excessive hair growth (especially on my chin)\\n3 - Irregular cycles\\n4 - Bleedy after intercourse\\n5 - Several Moody at time\\n6 - Hair loss (on my head)',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi Everyone!\\n\\nI just found out I\\'m about 2 months pregnant. We were TTC for over 2 years. I have PCOS. Here\\'s what worked for me:\\n\\n1- I joined Weight Watchers in Sept. \\'08 and lost 30 pounds by Feb. \\'09.\\nLosing weight was very difficult for me, but I set my mind to it. You too can do it! Even if it\\'s 10 pounds...tell yourself YOU CAN DO IT!\\n\\n2- I switched from regular milk to Soy milk (get the original one it tastes great!) this helps to regulate insulin levels which is a problem for certain PCOS women even if, like me, they don\\'t have diabetes. Also (so I was told) it helps people with low progesterone levels...like me!\\n\\n3-In Feb. \\'09 my OB/GYN inserted the tip of a  long swab in my cervix to open it up. He calls this an \"Egg Test\". He said my cervix opening was really small & tight. This procedure really hurt but thankfully only lasted 30 seconds. I couldn\\'t see the relation with my PCOS ovaries and this test but my DR. said to trust him and 2 months later I got pregnant!\\n\\n4-After the Egg Test I started taking 1 capsule of Red Clover Each day after 2 weeks I took 2/day. Stop taking Red Clover when you discover you\\'re pregnant though...\\n\\n--Before you take anything consult your Dr. to make sure it\\'s safe for you\\n\\n--My ob/gyn said that not all doctors believe in the \"egg test\" but he does and it works 80% of the time. It has to be done 21 days after your last period and you must have protected sex between these 21 days.\\n\\nGood luck / I know what you\\'re going through\\n\\nOMG!!! congrats\\ni found out that i have PCOS a couple of months ago so i started to take fish oil and vitex pills. So far for i had 3 periods in a row but again i missed my period for 2 months again. Not quite sure what is going on.\\ni have no insurance so i can\\'t go see a doc. what is this Red Clover??? what does this do??? i will try anything to get periods back on track\\n\\nCONGRATS on the baby!!!!!!!! i\\'m so happy for you\\nThe Red Clover helps with fertility. It\\'s been around since the beginning of time and used by Native Americans. It has many uses!! I wanted to try a chemical-free way to conceive...but I must admit I was ready to quit.\\n\\nIt\\'s so frustrating taking preg. test after test just to see a negative result. I was emotionally depressed with everything. The books tell you to stop \"thinking baby\" all the time but it\\'s so hard when it\\'s the one thing you want in the whole world.\\ni feel the same way. I feel like giving up!! I found a fertility place near by where i live. I hope i can get in there and see if they can help.\\nI hope i can have a baby one day.\\nYes you will - hang in there! How is your weight?\\n\\nLosing weight helped me get more periods (I got three since last Sept.) - The year before I had skipped the whole previous year without any....very hard when you\\'re ttc!\\n\\nI know I\\'m chubby, but what got me upset was that one of our friends (who doesn\\'t have pcos) is severely overweight. She got 3 kids one after the other. It angered me soooo much that I was told to lose weight & my friend doesn\\'t have a problem!!\\n\\nBut losing weight did help me...and I was bitter and frustrated with a lot of things. Don\\'t lose hope - you can do it\\n\\nmy weight it good i\\'m average size. i have been taking vitex and fish oil pills for the past 3 months and i got my period back in feb. i got it for 3 months strait all on time. But all of a sudden i skiped it almost 3 months in a row again. It\\'s so frustraiting!!!\\nI can relate when i see people with little kids or friends of mine. I just found out that a friend of mine is 4 months prego. I was really sad and jealous.\\nI won\\'t give up hope!\\nJust have to keep trying.\\nCongrats BassetHounds!  Wow...can I relate to your comments about people giving all kinds of crappy advice like \"Stop thinking about it all the time\"....and taking pregnancy tests only to see negative after negative after negative.  My husband and I just took a vacation with my sister and my 7 year old niece...to Walt Disney World and their other parks in Florida...children and babies were EVERYWHERE...and I can\\'t even count the times I saw parents who didn\\'t seem like \"good parents\"...doing things like cursing at their kids, etc...which just made me soooo mad.\\n\\nAnd my little niece...every time she sees me and my husband (we live in Georgia and she lives in Maryland) asks when are we going to have a baby, what will we name our babies, will we have boy or girl babies, etc.  So innocent...but it tears at my heart every time.  And the women in my family don\\'t understand....none of them had trouble getting pregnant...including my sister who had my niece while being single.  It kills me...sitting there wondering why I can\\'t seem to get pregnant, even though I have the happy marriage, the great career, an awesome education, etc.  This is so frustrating for me...because I\\'ve been good at almost everything I\\'ve done in the past, except this....and unfortunately achieving a positive pregnancy test isn\\'t something I can just study for and achieve.\\n\\nI was diagnosed with PCOS and insulin resistance last Fall.  I take Metformin regularly and when I\\'m consistent in exercising, my cycles run a perfect 28-day cycle.  I\\'m going to take your advice on using Red Clover....and I\\'m going to really focus on losing weight....and my \"prize\" for losing the first 15 pounds is going to be getting a HSG done, jsut to make sure I don\\'t have a secondary problem.\\n\\nYou\\'ve given me hope...so thank you.  I feel blessed to have found this group.  I need women to talk to who understand what I\\'m going through.\\n\\nCongrats again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\nYes debrevenn, you got it right on!! Your story is the same as mine...I see people everywhere who make it seem like it\\'s a burden on them to have their kids. People who walk twenty steps ahead of their toddlers without looking back to see if they\\'re following - makes me sick!!\\n\\nMy husband & I will be married for 4 years in the Fall...and every year on our Anniversary nosy family members would ask \"So when are the kids coming?\", \"Are you guys planning on starting a family soon?\"...but last year was the worse: we were told \"So, I guess you don\\'t want kids? Is something wrong?\" You just want to yell at people MIND YOUR OWN *** BUSINESS!!!! Very frustrating indeed.\\n\\nYes I am lucky to be pregnant. I wonder if PCOS is genetic...my parents had me after 8 years of marriage and my brother almost 7 years after that. My mom never got tested but her symptoms were the same as mine.\\n\\nI trust my Dr. He\\'s an older man and he says he does things differently. He told me never to touch drugs that have Provera with a 10 foot pole. He says it causes birth defects. He was going to put me on Metformin and Clomid (both at the same time) next year if I didn\\'t get pregnant...but he wanted me to try \"natural\" things first.\\n\\nBest of luck with the Red Clover...also, try to reduce your caffeine intake. I switched to decaf tea & coffee about 1 year ago.\\n\\nThanks for your kind words. Yes, my goal is to give hope to those who struggle as I did. I know what it feels like to feel lost and emotionally hopeless - Don\\'t give up! Keep your chin up...miracles happen!\\nBassethounds...I started Weight Watchers yesterday.  Surprisingly, when I got on the scale to record my beginning weight, I was a few pounds lighter, after the trip to Walt Disney World with my niece.  (The trip felt like a 7 day workout.)  Today I was rarely hungry and ended up the day with a few points leftover.  I\\'m hopeful that this is successful.  Also, my husband and I just added a German Shepherd to our household.  In order to keep up with his training, we make sure to walk him (and our shepherd mix) every day....so that helps add to the exercise count.\\n\\nHow\\'s the pregnancy going!?!\\n\\nDeb\\nWay to go Deb, you\\'re doing great!! I don\\'t know if you have Fibre1 bars where you are they\\'re granola bars and are only 2 points each. I took those instead of chocolate bars...they are really really tasty!! Glad to see you added a new doggy to the family. We have 2 and it\\'s awesome!\\n\\nMy pregnancy is going well thanks! I\\'ve decided to start wearing maternity clothes to actually \"look\" pregnant, \\'cause now people just think I\\'m putting the weight back on\\n\\n\\nCheers!! -BH\\nhi i was diagnosed with pcos about 3 1/2 years ago, i am 20 years old now, me and my partner have now been tryin for a baby for around 2 years with no look as ive been told im not ovalulating which i dont understand becasue im still having periods. i used to get really heavy irregular periods for the first couple of years of being diagnosed and then i slimmed down and lost around 30 pounds and they have become regular not to the date but near enough. i have had my fallopion tubes flushed out and there fine, my partner has had a sperm cont and hes fine, so its just me.\\n\\ni have been put on some tables (clomid) which i have to take one on the second day of my next period till the 6th day, and then i have to go back to the hospital on the 21st day of my period to have a blood test to see if i have ovaluated.\\n\\ni was wondering if anyone has been on these tables (clomid) and could give me some advise on the pregnancy rate and if any one has become pregnant after taking these tables.\\n\\ni was really scared when i was first diagnosed but now i have realised there is a lot of treatment out there for women like me and every1 else trying to concieve with pcos.\\n\\ni hope every1 is ok and to look on the positive side, if it was my partner who had the problem there wasnt much that could be done for him but its me and there is loads of treatment out there.\\n\\nalso another thing i no im gabbling on a bit but i have been pregnant b4 when i was 16 but sadly due to circumstances i had to abort. so what i dont understand is that i must have been ovulating then or i wouldnt have got pregnant.\\n\\nNatalie\\n\\nHi All!!\\n\\nI have PCOS as well. I have been suffering with this as well. Well the PCOS would not have been a problem if I didn\\'t want children, I have been trying for two years now, to fall pregnant and PCOS really makes it difficult, as I don\\'t ovalulate because of PCOS, one of the main factors associated. I have been on fertility drugs, treatments, like Clomid and injections, it didn\\'t work for me. All the gynocologist that I\\'ve been too has told me it is not treatable, you will never be rid of PCOS.\\nWell, I have good news! I am at a homeopath at the moment who is treating my PCOS with herbal medicine. He says in 8 weeks I will be rid of it. I have finished my first week, and am very exited. There IS hope. I would advise you to go to a homeopath, as I personally think most gynocologists only want to make money out of you!! I don\\'t have acne, or any of the other systems that usually are related to PCOS, however I do suffer with my weight because of that, and with ovulation and my periods is so iregular.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll the best\\nCongrats first to bassethound!! YAY!!\\n\\nI have been in this boat for many yrs. I am 33 yrs old and have many problems with my PCOS. I have 2 boys and they are 16 yrs apart! I tried many countless times to concieve with no luck and at the time drs did not know much about how to treat it or know about it at all! When I concieved my first son I was 15 and fine, I started to have problems when I turned 17 and did not know why til a dr finally told me I had PCOS. He knew very little at the time and did not treat me but put me on a med that made me have my periods every 3 months for a yr. I went yrs with no periods but started with all the symptoms like facial hair my hair thinning and hair on my body and weight gain!\\n\\nWhen I divorced the first husband I went through alot and I lost weight and here came the periods! I was shocked and happy! With my 2nd hubby we got pregnant 3 times and the 1st was a miscarriage and the 2nd my little girl was a premature birth at 22 weeks due to PCOS and my cervix being weak. My 3rd is my little miracle my baby boy (16 months old now)! There is hope out there and we all have our different ways of treating this condition so dont give up and find whats right for you! I am having my symptoms again due to weight gain after giving birth to my baby and just started the meds to help regualte my symptoms (metformin and Yaz the BC). Good luck to all you ladies and Im here if you need anything to talk about as ive been through it all it seems\\n!\\n\\nCongrats again to you  Bassethound!! I know the feeling of pure excitement!\\n\\nMyboysmylife\\n',\n",

       " {'post': \"I just found out that I am insulin resistant (also have PCOS) and my doctor put me on Metformin. I'm supposed to be ramping up to 2,000 mg a day (4 of the 500 mg pills a day).

I can only imagine what it will be like when I'm on 4 pills a day.\\n\\nI asked my doctor if there was anything else I could do instead of Metformin, and she said no. I need to figure out how to lessen the diarrhea by the end of the summer. I'm a teacher and can't be running to the bathroom all day long!\\n\\nAny advice?\\nDid your doctor say why you need to be on 2000mg?  I'm on 1000mg.  When i went above that the cramping became terrible.   1000mg worked incredibly for me, but I know everyone is very different and reacts diff to meds.  I would ask her to try to gradually work your way up to the 2000.  That seems like a huge jump very quickly to 2000.

I've been reading your post because I just don't know where to turn to either.   I was given metformin for my insulin resistance over 4 years ago.  At first, my body was fine with it, about six monhs into the medicine I started to have the worst stomach aches I've ever felt.   I couldn't even eat, I had diahrea right after.  I was bloated and felt sick all the time.  It got to the point that I would have to plan my events around a toilet.   I stopped taking metforin after suffering with the symptoms after 2 years.   I felt better within 48 hours.   I was off of it for another 2 years and my doctor kept insisting that I should start up on it because it would be the only thing that would work for me.   I've been on it six months, but only half the dose.    I'm so scared to take the full dose because I hated that life......I'm sick over it.\",\n",

No metformin, it wasn't well known with PCOS in 2002. My body responded and I made a good egg every cycle for 2 years, we finally got pregnant using 150 mg of clomid. 4 years later we were ready for #2, we tried clomid and metformin.

I found him through the PCOS website for recommended Drs. He understands PCOS so much. He said the science in PCOS is starting to see that metformin doesn't work as well with PCOS as originally thought. I am currently doing my first IVF cycle. So I guess what I'm saying is everyone even with the same condition is different, PCOS gets worse over time, and if building your family is what is important to you then be aggresive in your treatment.

After I started taking it I felt sooooo much better.  Have your doctor check your iron levels especially if you are losing a lot of blood.  I was also checked for a blood clotting disease called von willebrand which was causing me to bleed a lot. I was diagnosed with type 1.

Best wishes to you\\n\\nKristina\\nMet and Clomid work for some women.  The don't work for other women.  Because of this, many doctor's won't keep you on either med indefinitely.  They usually do three to four cycles on the stuff(sometimes accompanied by IUI, and sometimes not).  If that doesn't work, you can move to the shits or consider IVF.  Many women I know jump to IVF right away because it has the highest success rate.  problem there is the expense.  Most women I know have had pretty good success with Clomid.  it jumpstarts their system.  Chin up...you will get pregnant soon\",\n",

I had regular periods before I became pregnant and the ring of cysts were always there.  Even now that I'm pregnant they are still there.\\nHello Saraw,\\n\\nNo just because you got your period it does not mean that your cyst is gone.  I have an 8 cm simple cyst that has been there for about a year and I have been getting regular monthly periods.  Only an ultrasound can confirm that your cyst is gone.  Good luck.\\n\\nEstria\\nI have PCOS and in the last three months, I've had a nasty  bladder infection.  I was treated with antibiotics and as of one week ago, I was told that the infection is gone.  Yesterday, I felt a dull pain, ache in my lower left abdomen that is a little different from the dull ache I had with the bladder infection.  I'm so confused and don't know what to do.   I started thinking about what else it could be.   I'm wondering if the ache is from a cyst that maybe developed.   I did notice, right before my infection that my hormones were a bit out there.....feeling depressed a lot and more than usual and then boom I got the infection and now I'm feeling like I have a little ball tugging at the lower part of my left side.....I'm scared.    I know I should see my gynecologist, but I'm not happy about being probed and poked at.\\n\\nHas anyone else had this problem?\\nI get periods and still have lots of little cysts all over both ovaries. I dont know if they go away.\",\n",

But I found out last week after 18 years of trying that I am 6 weeks pregnent.\\nNo one was more shocked than me and I did 4 tests and confirmed with the doctor before I could believe it.\\nHowever on friday I started bleeding and was sent to a early pregnancy unit for a scan, they checked and we saw a little sac with a heartbeatin the middle and was told that everything was fine and that it was breakthough bleeding or embedding bleeding caused by the baby's implatation.\\nI would like to hear from anybody who has experienced this has I am a bit heavier today and the hospital says I should not be worried and to let it run its course and I'm not sure how long it should go on for or how heavy it should be.\\nOn a brighter note please don't give up hope if I can get this far after 18 years of pcos there is hope for anybody else. The only thing I did different was to have reflexology I'm now a complete believer.\\n\\nChris\\n\\nCONGRATULATIONS! My aunt could not get pregnant as well. She was married in her early 20's and could not get pregnant. When she was around 44 she got pregnant without after all these years (she wasn't trying to). It was sad because at the time when she got pregnant she felt that she was too old, and they told her about the risks and she was getting kinda sick from being pregnant so she decided not to go through with it.  I think she should have because it was a blessing...but I don't know if she regrets her decision or not. I wish you all the best and CONGRATULATIONS ONCE AGAIN!!\\n\\nCONGRATS,\\nImplantation bleeding is pretty normal. Pretty textbook stuff.  As long as you don't feel any cramping, you should be fine.  Also, some women get a light period around the time they'd normally get a period.  Good luck and god bless!\\nHi Chris, big congrats to you.  I have PCOS and I also am pregnant.  I also had bleeding when I was almost 6.5 weeks, the bleeding was a little heavy but it was brown in color.  My doctor wanted to see me right away and at the u/s everything was fine.  They told me it was implantation bleeding and not to worry about it and that it would last for a couple of days.   Since you are over 6 weeks I would suggest for you to jump to the pregnancy board because you'll be able to hear from other pregnat women and they'll answer to a lot of your questions.\\nHi there,\\nHow long did your bleeding last for? Im still bleeding 5 days now and getting heavier everyday. I'm really worried now and have booked in for another scan on Thursday morning to check things out. I'm not to confident to be honest I really believe that I am losing this baby that I have waiting so long for. I just don't see how it can be ok after the amount of bleeding I'm having. I don't know what I am going to do if I lose this baby.\\nOh Chris I'm sorry, I was only bleeding for 3 days but by the last day it was very light and then it just stopped.  I remember the doctor telling me that I should go in again if the bleeding became heavier and redish like a period.  I sure hope that everything will be ok with you and your baby.  Let us know how everything goes on Thursday.  Please think positive and don't lose hope, we are here to support you.\\nHi Solange,\\nBad news I'm affraid. I went for the scan this morning and we have lost the baby. I'm beside myself I just don't know what to do. Everybody is  fussing over me and I just want to scream, and to be left alone. I know I can try again but it took 18 years for this one and don't know how many more years I can do this. Thank you for listening.\\nChris\\nChris, I am sorry for your lose and pain. I didn't have the words, but I'm thinking of you and you're in my prayers.\\nOh Chris, I'm deeply sorry this has happened.  I was really hoping the bleeding would stop.  It is a good idea to take some time for yourself.  I'll be praying for you and please don't give up, I know it's easier said than done, but don't lose your hopes.\\nHi solange,\\nThank you for your kind words and prayers. I'm just numb at the moment. I keep crying without warning, I'm not even sure what starts me off half the time. My husband and family have been great, but they don't really know what to say or do for me. I can't blame them I don't even know what to do either. The bleeding finally stopped today so I guess it's all over physically now. I just need to try to pick myself up and carry on now. I haven't used birth control for 18 years and I'm not going to now. I'm going to continue with my if it happen's it happen's attitude that I'v had for years and just hope for the best.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I started my period at 14.  I was always irregular and had very painful periods as well as severe lower abdominal pain while i was not menstrating so i was put on birth control to help regulate my periods.  My doctor said that the pain was normal and that I shouldnt worry too much about it.  She said they were just cramps and that I would get used to them.  The pills she put me on would work most of the time, but sometimes even while taking the birth control pills i wouldnt have a period.  I was on these pills for 1.5 years.  (i was also taking them for severe migraines and acne and it didnt help with those problems).  Since being off of the pills (3.5-4 years now) i have had VERY irregular periods.  I go 3-4 months without one and the longest i went without one was 9 months.  After the 9 months without a period (semptember 07 - june 08), my period was heavy and had a lot of clots in it.  Sometimes the tampon would have like a \"layer\" of blood and white/clear film on it (very thick).  I found some old birth control pills that hadnt expired yet and in an attempt to have another period i took the pills.  A month later, i had a period (july 08) but the pills ran out and then i went a month without a period again (semptember 08).  I recently (august 08) thought i had a yeast infection.  All the signs and symptoms were present so i went to the doctor (first time in 2+ years).  I had a pap smear done (sept. 18, 2008) and I was diagnosed with BV and given medication for it. The results of my pap came in 3 days ago stating i had \"candida\" present (yeast infection).  In severe discomfort, I went to wal mart and bought a home testing kit and the pH level that i had was higher than that of a yeast infection (pH level was 6 and yeast infections are 4.5 or lower - google).  I am going thursday for the medication for a yeast  infection.  However, during my dr visit my dr said she thought i have PCOS.  She referred me to see a GYN to get a proper diagnosis.\\n\\nIn a nut shell (i guess :-D)\\n\\nI have always had severe lower abdominal pains.  So bad sometimes that if i am doing something, i have to stop and sit down and wait for them to be over.  If I am not having severe pains, I am in constant discomfort in my lower abdomen.  I have a lot of pain during intercourse (i have been sexually active with one partner for 4 years and very frequently have pain during intercourse in my lower abdomen and pelvic area. i also feel pain inside my vaginal walls...like a sharp very discomforting pain).  It is not uncommon for me to bleed after intercourse (most of the time it is a darker blood but sometimes brighter blood).  I also have lower abdominal pain during bowel movements.  It is a very sharp and discomforting pain (even when i am not constipated) I have also had severe acne for 3-4 years now.  I recently gained a little weight (2007) and havent really been able to get it off (even through diet and exercising).  My dr said that acne and pains and irregularities are symptoms of PCOS.  She also said that weight gain and facial hair (i dont really have the facial hair symptom) are also signs of PCOS.  She also gave me some information about Thyroid disease.  PCOS and ovairan cancer runs in my family.  My great aunt died of cervical cancer and another close female relative was diagnosed with ovarian cancer.  My grandma had a hysterectmy quite some years ago due to female reproductive complications.\\n\\nI am sorry about all the information I put in this thread...i just dont really have anyone else i can ask this right now.  I am living on my own so of course just like anybody else i am having financial problems right now. I am working on getting insurance but it is taking longer than i expected.  I plan on going to the GYN after i get my insurance, i guess I\\'m just looking for some sort of an answer/suggestion here.  Maybe someone else is experiencing or has experienced this before....\\n\\nThanks for your time and patience,\\nAmber\\nHi Amber welcome to the healthboards.  I was diagnosed with PCOS over 10 years ago (I\\'m 33 now) and I had all of the symptoms.  It started with missed periods from the age of 16, then over the years I gained weight, I had facial hair, dark patches on the skin, and pelvic pain.  My pain wasn\\'t as intense as yours but it was there, once in a while I felt like stabing pains mostly on my left side and I also had to just sit for a little bit until it went away.  Sometimes also during intercourse I felt some discomfort and pain but I would say that was about 20% of the time.\\nIn order for you to get properly diagnosed you will need many tests such as blood work, ultrasound and I had a laparoscopy done (not everyone has this) so it does get expensive if you don\\'t have insurance.  You could see a gyn doctor but they might refer you to an endocrinologist.  So I hope you get your insurance soon so you\\'ll have all your questions answered.\\nWhat I can suggest to you is to try to live a healthy life.  Exercising and eating healthy helps a lot in women with PCOS.\\nAll the best to you.',\n",

My dr. said not to exspect anything less than 3 months a girl i know started it 3 months ago and she just found out she is pregnant. do you think it was because of the metformin?

I just found out a couple months ago that i have PCOS. I just wanted to know if anyone has had success with metformin =-)\\nmetformin gave me 30 times a day diahreea.. If you take metformin you also have to take like femara or gonal f injections to produce eggs.. when your pcos you dont hatch eggs.. I have pcos and insulin resistance., I just got out of the hospital, because i was bleeding for 7 weeks straight.. Had to get a blood transfusion.. pcos is awful.. i want kids too.. i keep praying.. The things i said above are the correct steps to take.. good luck..\\n\\nI couldn't get pregnant on metformin alone but I did get my periods every month.  I have a friend who also has PCOS and took metformin and she got pregnant 3 months after.  When my RE was telling me about metformin, he also told me of other patients he had in the past that got pregnant with only metformin.  So it is possible of getting pregnant by taking only metformin.  It is not a pleasant medication to take because it upsets your stomach but it is good to lower the sugar in the blood.\\nHi there I have POS too ..The pills arent working for me either .. I keep getting my period early before the pills i was only 1 day early and now im like 5-7 days early which sucks ..I'm 36 so my clock is about to blow up soon lol.. I go to the doctors next week who knows what she will do now .. Oh and she also said I would lose weight and thats not working either ..\\nGood luck to you !\",\n",

The fact that my symptoms come and go and I cramp all the time doesn\\'t help. Has anyone every felt this way before?  And has anyone camped alot during the first trimester or is the PCOS affecting the pregncy in a different way.

I\\'m also pregnant and I also have PCOS.  I don\\'t really have any more cramps that I used to have before I became pregnant, it actually seems it\\'s less, the only thing that doctors are keeping an eye on me is for my sugar blood level.  Because of the insulin resistance which is related to PCOS, they are concerned that I will develop gestational diabetes so I need to monitor my levels.  Other than that, I really haven\\'t had any other symptoms related to PCOS.\\nPlease think positive and don\\'t stress yourself over the pregnancy, stress is never good for the baby.  Just make sure you are being checked by a doctor.  I can\\'t really say much here about the pregnancy, I would suggest for you to move into the pregnancy boards.  In case you want to ask me any other questions, I\\'m under the April 2009 mommies.\\nI wish you and your baby all the best.\\nThank you for the response. I think you\\'re right I will try to take it to the pregnancy board.  It\\'s just that I\\'m thinking it might be related to PCOS.\\nI have pco and have two beautiful baby boys. I had to go on fertility the to get prego the first time and when he was 9 months old i got prego with the second one. I cramped alot with my first pregnancy and even spotted a little. I was also worried every minute that went by. Just relax and you will be fine. I think it is just your uterous contracting, adjusting to the new pregnancy.

I want to start by telling you that a big number of women with PCOS do get pregnant and I\\'m one of them.  I am currently pregnant after having an IVF cycle.\\nI also started missing my periods when I was 16 and they were less and less every year, I was also put on bc pills but I didn\\'t get diagnosed with PCOS until I was 23, I\\'m 33 now.  I continued with the pills for many years because I wasn\\'t trying to get pregnant anyways.  I strated taking Metformin about 4 years ago and just like you and most who take this medication it was awfull to my stomach but I finally got used to it about 2 months after taking it.  I was also overweight and I can tell you that just taking Metformin alone did not help me lose weight, I was still the same weight after taking the medication for over 1 year.  Then two years ago my doctor told me I needed to do something about my weight if I was planing on having a baby, so I went on a diet and exercise plan and I lost close to 30lbs. I always tell people that if they want to lose weight on Metformin alone is not going to work, it will help but you need to do your part.\\nMy husband and I started to TTC last year in October 2007, first we tried naturally, I was having my periods every month but it never happened, then we tried clomid for 3 months and nothing happened.  My husband was tested and we came to find out he had low sperm count.  So we did one month of IUI and that also didn\\'t work.  Finanlly we tried one cycle of IVF and it was a perfect BFP.  The whole proccess since we decide to have a baby took about 8 months.\\nSo I just want to tell you not to lose hope, if you take care of yourself and your health, if you have a good doctor that knows you well and has a good plan for you, you have a good chance of getting pregnant.  Most women who are trying to get pregnant see a Reproductive Endocrinologist.  Also I don\\'t know how the medical insurance is in Scotland, but my insurance in the US paid for everything.  If you don\\'t have insurance you can end up paying thousands.\\nI wish you the best and please think positive because one day you will have a baby.\\nOh I forgot about tips to losing weight.  I did something similar to the South Beach diet but I skiped the first stage.  I ate every 3 hours, small meal and always included veggies, fruist, protein, healthy carbs, fish and also took a daily women\\'s vitamin.  Believe me I cheated once is a while, had a small bowl of ice-cream, a small piece of cake at a birthday party, something like that, but never over doing it.\\nFor exercise I joined a gym and worked out 5 days/week.  I did cardio work such as, spinning or cycling, running, erobics class and also did weight training to tone the muscles.  If you don\\'t want to join a gym you can take walks, runs, use a bike, or exercise videos so you can do them at home.  I know it\\'s extremely hard and you have to have will power to lose weight, but if you set your mind to it you will do it.  It also helps if you have someone to exercise with to help you through it.\\nHiya Sam, Im 19 and was diagnosed with PCOS last year and like you, the thought of not being able to have children made me feel so dissappointed. My periods began at the age of 11 and by the time I was 14 they were pretty much regular. My dad then died and between the ages of 14 and 18, I only had 3 periods. I tried lost of different pills from my GP to try and regulate them but nothing work. Also at that time, I started putting on heaps and heaps of weight; mum thought I was over eating due to the stress of losing dad but I\\'d gone off food if anything. I started looking around on the internet 18months ago at menstrual related diseases and went back to my GP, who reluctuantly agreed to send me for an ultrasound and blood tests (he\\'d thought it was stress of A Levels, and dad and generally being a teeenager) and since he got the results he always said that I had the most clear cut case of PCOS hes ever seen in his career. I\\'m not on Dianette and Metformin, watching what I eat and exercising as and when I can around studying for my degree.\\nAs for advice, the first thing I would say is to not panic !! The more stressed out you are, the worse everything seems and it spirals from there. Secondly, talk to your family about it. The more aware of the situation they are, the more they want to help! Speaking of food, its only now I\\'m finding what I can eat that suits me and what I can\\'t, and its not as simple as cutting out fatty foods !! I now have a Slimfast milkshake for breakfast because it fills me up, I get lots of nutrients and I\\'m full until lunchtime so I don\\'t snack. I was pretty healthy anyway so I\\'ve carried on having a pitta bread for lunch and a smaller portion of whatever I cook for an evening meal. The best tip I can give you though if you fancy going out to do some exercise, if take your best friend along with you !! Its much more fun to have a chat and someone with you.\\nApart from that, good luck and I hope this has helped xxx\\nPS\\nOh, a good book is PCOS A woman\\'s guide to dealing with polycystic ovarian syndrome, its simple and easy to understand.\\nI am new here too. I am older, 43 was diagnosed PCOS at 16 but never really knew what it meant. They told me I probably would never have children. (so I never used bc) My first marriage didn\\'t last and I ended up losing a lot of weight. My new boyfriend and I ended up pregnant (hahaha fooled them right) then after I lost my baby weight again I became pregnant with my 2nd. I still didn\\'t know too much about why I jsut figured they didn\\'t know what they were talking about. now that I am older and because of the invention of the internet I can see the syndrome really has affected my whole life. I lost weight back then in an unhealthy way. Now trying to lose weight is next to impossible. I went to a weight management doc and he looked at my bloodwork and said I was insulin resistant. He asked me a few questions and immediately put 2 and 2 together about the PCOS. I take metformin (which kills my digestive system) exercise, eat healthy and all of it together helped me lose 40 lbs. I also used Byetta for a while which really helped. I now am finding my liver is having issues and i can\\'t take the metformin any more. PCOS sure affects your body! I have just started to take milk thistle to help clean my liver. I hope it helps!\\nHello!  I SO know how you are feeling.  I am 22 and getting married 9/19/09.  I was diagnosed at about 14.  I didn\\'t start my period until I was 13, but for my family that is quite early.  Having five sisters who didn\\'t start until they were 15-17.  I was also having weight gain with no reason why, no diet helped.  Yes, try being 14 in weight watchers.  Every time I would weigh and gain weight or not lose weight my mom would no scold me but we would sit down and she would tell me she packs my lunches ect she wanted to know where I was getting my \"extra\" food.  The thing is I was not!  I was hurt that she didn\\'t believe me, but I was wondering the same thing.  Why was it not working.  Then, as if being an overweight girl in high school wasn\\'t enough I started to grow a little extra hair on my neck/chin area.  Not the chin you see on my face, and not quite my neck, the area between I guess.  Unlike you my periods didn\\'t stop coming they came all the time, they were heavy and horrible.  I never really got cramps though.  So my Mom started to talk to other Dr\\'s I saw so many of them!  Finally one day I was sick and my Mom had picked me up from school.  She had a doctors apt and before we could go home I had to go.  Just randomly she asked her doctor if she knew anything that would help my hair.  Then we started talking about my other symptoms.  This doctor being fairly new to the field happened to remember something from school.  She left and came back and said I think she has PCOS.  She started doing my testing and sure enough I did.  I was put on BC to help regulate my periods and metformin which like everyone else I HATED!  I tried many BC pills over the years but finally found one that seems to be the best for my periods, extra hair, and I didn\\'t gain extra weight on it.  I have been on it for about four years now it is Crystalle.  I went all through HS being the fat friend.  I hated it.  I hated the metformin.  I hated going to the diatitcian and her always telling me I must be cheating...I wasn\\'t...finally I started cheating.  All that said I have now lost 110 lbs.  It was not easy but it is possible and because of the weight loss I no longer take Metformin, and my fertility chances are much better.  It was my endocrinologist who led me to the right \"diet\" but it is not a diet it is a total life change.  I work out three times a week.  At first I hated it but now I look forward to it.  Food.  This was the hardest part!  The insulin resistance we have that is associated with PCOS reacts with different foods.  Mainly carbs like bread, pasta, and the simple starches or carbs like potatoes and rice.  And of course sugar.  Now in replacement you eat lots of protein.  This is not the atkins diet or the south beach diet I guess it is similar but not a diet.  The first month or so was the hardest for me.  The first things she told me to start with were easy.  Do not drink half hour before or after eating, or during.  The liquid acts as a \"lube\" that makes the food flush out faster so you don\\'t stay full as long.  It did suck not to drink while eating but I don\\'t mind anymore.  The next cut carbonated drinks out all together.  Not just soda all carbonated bevarages.  The carbonation is a gas that \"presses\" on your stomach helping it to stay \"stretched\" out.  These are simple things that don\\'t work alone but help over all success and are easy \"first\" steps.  Then the hard part comes getting rid of the carbs.  For me it was all or nothing for a long time.  I couldn\\'t have just a little pasta, or a couple fries.  So until I got used to not eating those things I just didn\\'t.  Then surgar.  I didn\\'t have candy or cake ect for a long time.  I still don\\'t really eat ice cream because of the sugar content.  You really do \"withdraw\" from the carbs and the sugar but once you get over it they don\\'t really seem appealing.  And when I do eat them I eat less because they are just \"to sweet\"  There are many tips and tricks that helped me get through and if you are interested I would be more than happy to share.  It was VERY VERY hard but now it is so worth it and I don\\'t feel like I\\'m missing anything becaue I do eat pasta and sugar just in smaller amounts than I ever did.  I hope this was not to long and boring and helped a little!\\nShawna\\nthanks everyone,\\nits good to know im nt the only one, since my last post my doctor has put me on orlistat 120mg, which i take 3 times a day with my meals along with a low fat diet, fingers crossed it works, thanks for all the tips for losing weight, im trying them all, any others would also be welcome, i\\'ve got till july to lose 56kgs, so i can get my wedding dress, xxx\\nHey Sam and everyone else, I\\'m Samantha and I\\'m 25.  I found out I had PCOS a little over a year ago.  Reading the posts in thread had me in tears.  It\\'s been an emotional day and to actually see that there are plenty of people who feel exactly like I do is surprising.  This is my first time to on here.  I came on here tonight because I\\'m also getting married next year (12-26-09) and my fiance and I have been trying to concieve.  I\\'ve always had my periods, but they\\'ve been somewhat irregular.  I thought they had started to even out.  I\\'m about eight days past when I thought I would start, so I thought I might be pregnant, but a negative tests and now cramps this evening has crushed me.  I want to be a mom so bad and the thought of that never happening hurts so bad.\\n\\nI\\'ve been taking Metformin for almost a year.  I started out one a day at 500mg.  It got raised to 850mg twice daily.  As you know, it KILLS me.  In February I had a miscarriage.  In May I went on vacation and stopped taking the Metformin because I knew it\\'d ruin my trip.  Finally I eased back on it, relunctly.  Have you guys found any way to ease the effects of this medicine?\\n\\nI\\'ve recently switched doctors to try and help me get pregnant.  Last week I did blood tests and a glucose test.  (Where you have to drink the orange stuff, wait two hours, and do more blood)  I got back on Nov. 14 for the results.\\n\\nHow do you guys deal with the pain of maybe never having kids?\\ni couldnt deal with it, the thought of it made me not want to live anymore, for years all i have wanted is kids and its sooooo hard. its even harder when my friend who is 28 has been trying for 2 years nd had 2 ectopic pregnancys, its hard to watch and go through it wth her and then also have chances i myt never be a mum,\\nBUT...\\ni have since learned that everyone around me loves me no matter what, im not goin to disappoint anyone by never concieving but if i did it wud b the best thing in the world, there is a lot doctors can do these day, a lot they can try before they finally tell u u can\\'t have kids, and if that comes there is also adoption or foster care,\\n\\nhte best thing u can do is to think positive otherwise u myt nt make it to the day wen u concieve, jst remember this one thing my dad always says to me\\nEVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON, if its meant to happen it will ortherwise u r destined to do something else in your life, u will know sooner or later, just be patient and LIVE YOUR LIFE. the things u want always come when u least expect it!!',\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi\\n\\nI've been getting pain on my right ovary for a while now, all my scans appear normal - my gyno thinks it could be endometriosis but she said if the pain gets worse we will look into it.  I recently starting taking a drug called Androcur for my hair loss and last month my periods did not come.  And also felt a lot of pain on my right had side again, this time much worse.  I continued on with taking the pill as usual and the Androcur the following month and am 2 week in my cycle and the pain has gotten worse.  Last night I went into hospital and they did another ultrasound but this time they could not find my right ovary.  The gynie said its not a bad thing but its not a good thing either – but they did not think I have anything to worry about.  I'm still in a lot of pain and dont know if I should go back to my gyno to ask for a laparoscopy.  I am now off the Androcur cos I am worried that it may have caused this problem.\\n\\nI'm really scared of the unknown.  Any advice or thoughts\\n\\nThanks in advance\\nnormally pain in the right ovary can be caused from ovulation. but if your not getting your period, you should check for a cyste, with one of those ultrasounds they do introvertedly? i dont remember what its called, but they stick a vibrator looking thing into your vagina. Thats how they found my cyste, otherwise they never saw it with regular scans. Also my sisters was discovered days before it would have bursted, by gettin this kind of ultrasound. She was feeling the same pain you describe. hope this helps ,\",\n",

I have a few break-outs now and then (nothing makeup cant cover!) and ive noticed in increase in hair and i know diane is supposed to help with those hormonal issues. but what im REALLLY wondering is the whole weight gain issue.\\n\\nMost pills are notorious for adding a 5-10 padding and every doctor recommends weight LOSS as a way to alleviate pcos symptoms... SO does going on the pill really help with pcos? and does anyone have any weight-gain/loss stories with diane 35?!\\nAndiepants... Ive just switched from allese to diane-35 i just finished my first pack (the doc has me on it bc from sept-oct Ive started to develop really bad back acne =( , I have never had it this bad before normally a pimple or two now its just embarrasing) Ive noticed although my diet hasnt changed much I look at my body and its changing my love handles have grown so have my boobs...I also feel fatter.. keep in mind I run everyday min 40mins and weight train 6 days a week. I eat fairly healthy too I came on this site bc I think Diane 35 is making me gain weight =(\\n\\nps i was on allese for 4 years and never had a problem with it... never made me gain weight before allese i was on tri cyclen and that did make me gain weight as well\\nAfter being diagnosed with PCOS years ago the DIANE 35 saved me. Took care of all the acne.  My boobs grew a lot and I probably gained weight but I think if you stick with it you could lose the weight.  It stopped all the hair growth and acne.  I felt \"normal\".\\nHey ..I am on Diane and have been for just over 5 yrs. I did notice weight gain at the beginning and also over the years I have noticed that I got stretch marks (many many in many areas) as well as a huge increase in cellulite. I feel like slowly it has progressively gotten worse. I weigh about 120 and im 5\\'5 I am just really worried because I dont know if this is a reaction from the pill. Has anyone had this reaction ?????? I have asked the doctors and no one has really given me any info. The cellulite and stretch marks are also in strange areas like all down my legs including my calves. I am not very big person and I try to workout as much as possible so I am confused as to why this is happening.\\nAnyone experiencing the same thing?....if so what did you do because I am debating on going off of Diane and trying something else.',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hello,\\nI have been diagnosed with having a ~6 cm hemorrhagic septated ovarian cyst and a ~6 cm hemorrhagic simple ovarian cyst.\\nMy question is: Can they be treated via ultrasound guided aspiration (together with antibiotic therapy), or is surgery inevitable?Has anyone gone under such a procedure for such cysts?\\nThanks a lot,\\n\\nMarion\\nHello Marion,\\n\\nI believe that like simple cysts, hemorrhagic cysts can regress on their own so your doctor may even recommend a simple follow up ultrasound in a little while.\\n\\nYour main issue is the septated cyst.  Depending upon your health care physician, you may need to have this one removed and tested, just to be on the safe side.  The most probable outcome is that they will want to do a laparoscopy to remove at least the septated cyst.\\n\\nAntibiotics are not needed for cysts.  Sometimes doctors put women on birth control pills because they believe that this rests the ovaries but it is now known that oral contraceptives are ineffective at either shrinking existing cysts or preventing new ones from growing.  The latest generation of birth control pills interfere mostly with the hormone surge that occurs when an egg is released from a follicular cyst (ie. ovulation) and not with the actual growth of functional cysts.  Therefore women are still growing cysts on their ovaries and I even suspect that oral contraceptives may have something to do with causing cysts although there is no scientific evidence at the moment to back this up.\\n\\nAfter 20 years on the birth control pill, I developed an 8 cm simple cyst on my left ovary and at the moment I am choosing to keep an eye on it.  If it starts to grow or change (ie. develop solid components), I will need to have surgery to remove it.  The thought does not thrill me and I am furious with myself for having remained on the pill for so long but what\\'s done is done.  Recovery from a laparoscopy is usually about a week.\\n\\nGo and talk to your doctor about the scan and see what he or she recommends.  What you have occurs to millions of women and with the advent of the ultrasound, tons of cases of persistent cysts are being discovered that would have otherwise gone unnoticed (cysts don\\'t always present symptoms).\\n\\nTake care and come back and tell us how you are doing.\\nThank you Estria for the information.\\n\\nBoth cysts have been there for at least 6 months now. I just began birth control pills upon the doctors advise. I will have to give them a try before I have the operation.\\nI can aspirate the simple cyst and operate the septated one but than, if the simple cyst reforms, I will have to do laparoscopy twice.\\nWhat I do not know is: Are septated cysts aspirated, or it is never practiced in hospitals, they are only operated? I read that septated cysts of the breast are aspirated and in one book they described how they aspirated the septated cyst of the ovary.\\nI am young and just married and I would like to have children. If I do laparoscopy it may damage ~half my ovaries and I suppose hormonally I would become older and it would be much more difficult to have children.\\n\\nI was reading that vets treat ovarian cysts of cattle and horse with one GnrH injection and than injections of PGF2a (type of prostaglandin)  for some days, and ~80 % of the cysts are gone in weeks with this treatment. I have not heard of any such treatment for humans.\\n\\nI have tried castor oil packs occasionally, but I don\\'t believe it will help much. I am keeping an anti-tumour, healthy diet and my CA125 has been 7.6 the last time I measured it. So the septated cyst must not be a tumour. I am eating a lot of pigment rich plants (beetroot, green leafes, carrots etc.) , because they say these have anti-tumour properties. Also I am eating whole foods, mainly raw, no oils, no sugar etc.\\n\\nIf the septated cyst cannot be a tumour under these circumstances, I do not understand why I cannot get it aspirated.\\nI hope your cyst is resolved soon.\\n\\nGreetings,\\nMarion\\nHi Marion,\\n\\nI don\\'t understand why, if they are thinking of removing the septated cyst with surgery, don\\'t they remove the other simple cyst at the same time ?  Is it so that they don\\'t have to touch both of your ovaries ?\\n\\nI was also offered the aspiration option by another doctor that I went to see and when i asked him if there was a chance that the cyst would return, he was unable to give me a straight answer.  I suspect that recurrence of the cyst after aspiration is quite common because the \"shell\" of the cyst is left intact and this can refill with epithelial fluid.\\n\\nI totally understand your concern over them damaging your ovaries so that you can neither have children nor continue to function normally and need to supplement with hormone replacement therapy.  Normally if a woman has both of her ovaries removed, HRT is required so that she will not go into early menopause.  HRT has its own benefits and risks to consider.  If only one ovary is removed, your body will still be able to function normally and you can still get pregnant.  There is also always the option of freezing some of your eggs, just in case.\\n\\nI would try to deal with a doctor who has a lot of experience in such matters.  Some surgeons specialize in this type of thing.  Of course there are never 100% guarantees and at some point you are going to have to weigh the risk to your health with your risk of not being able to have children.  My sister in law had one of her ovaries removed and still managed to get pregnant.  And my cousin had an ovarian cyst torse her ovary so she was wheeled in to emergency surgery where they removed her right ovary.  Her left ovary was constantly developing large cysts and she was having regular ultrasounds to keep an eye on them.  She managed to have two children (a boy and a girl) and then decided to have everything taken out at the age of 35.  She is now on HRT.  This was a personal decision and she decided that she no longer wanted to live with regular ultrasounds.  i personally would have waited longer as she will now have to be on HRT for approximately 15 years which is quite a long time.\\n\\nWhy not get a few different opinions from different doctors as to what your options and their associated risks are ?  This will enable you to make a sound decision.  If your cysts have been there unchanged for 6 months, they are most likely harmless and this will give you a little bit of time to explore your options.  Try to get at least another opinion, just to be sure.  The CA-125 test is also reassuring (mine was at 7 also) but this test is not conclusive by any means so don\\'t put too much on it.  The most important thing is what the radiologist or gynecologist thought when looking at the ultrasound (this, evidently has more predictive value).\\n\\nBy the way, the bovine treatment that you discuss actually \"shuts down\" the ovaries completely and I think that this treatment may be available in Germany (I have only heard about this and am not sure if it is true).  It works along the same principle as the use of the birth control pill.  I am not sure if this will necessarily get rid of the existing cyst though although if you say that 80% regress ... it also depends upon what type of cysts they are (simple or complex) and how large ... In women most cysts that are simple cysts of 5 cm or less go away on their own, with or without anti ovulants (according to several studies).  Its the ones we have have (either complex or large or both) that are in the grey zones ..\\n\\nTry to discuss this with at least another specialist and see if you can get another opinion and perhaps more options.  If in the end they all recommend that you have surgery to remove it in order to reduce the risk to your health then I would certainly err on the side of caution.\\n\\nAll the best.\\nHi Estria,\\n\\nMy cysts may be endometrioma or hemorrhagic corpus luteum, more probably corpus luteum. Depending on what they are the chance for them to go with aspiration differs. For endometrioma it may be ~30%. For corpus luteum much higher.\\nI read of an experiment with dogs where they performed aspiration repeatedly if the cyst recurred, along with antibiotics. All the cysts went away with at most 4 aspirations.\\nI have gotten the opinion of 4 doctors so far and they did not feel like the aspiration is the right thing to do.\\nBut it may be that they do not have much experience in doing it, or  operation is more profitable, or they do not know how much does the laparoscopy damage the ovary etc.\\n\\nI may try to aspirate the simple cyst and some months after that do the laparoscopy. If the simple cyst has returned I will operate both of them, if it has not recurred I will have to operate only one ovary.\\nHalf the damage.\\nAs for the cattle I better read the articles this time and the treatment I referred to was in reality treatment for falling pregnant, 80 % of the cattle with cysts fell pregnant. I can try this route as well. Have IVF without doing anything to the cysts, if this can be done. I am afraid this can be done with smaller cysts not with the big ones I have.\\n\\n\\nMarion\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHi Marion,\\n\\nIf your doctors are OK with waiting this out for a little bit, then why not leave the simple cyst alone as well ?  Corpus Luteal cysts usually go away on their own as do some hemmorraghic cysts.  I do not think that having cysts preclude you from becoming pregnant.  I know many women who have managed to become pregnant despite having cysts.  And as you say, at worst you can try IVF.  As for the laparoscopy, they will definitely have to keep at least one ovary in tact in order for you to bear children though .. even with IVF.  Your ovaries regulate hormones during pregnancy in addition to providing the eggs.  You may want to discuss if aspiration would have any risks involved as well.  I imagine that they would have to go through the uterus in order to get to the cyst so aspiration may not necessarily be better than a laparoscopy.  You need to discuss all of the risks involved for both procedures in light of the fact that you want to become pregnant.\\n\\nIt would be wonderful if those cysts are not there at your next ultrasound (goodness knows this is what I am always hoping when I go for my ultrasound every so often).  Take care and let us know what you and your doctors decide to do.\\nHi Estria,\\n\\nI got some additional information from the web regarding these cysts. It seems that the problem  is that there is a small chance that the cyst is not functional, or endometrioma, but a tumour, called cystadenoma, which on ultrasound may look like a simple cyst, and in such case the aspiration would not resolve it and the tumor left there may turn malignant. It also would be difficult to find again the tumour without the liquid. They cannot say for sure from the ultrasound or analysis of aspirated fluid or biopsy of whether the cyst is neoplastic (tumour) or other. They can only say for sure if they excise it.\\nAspiration may cause infection, but it is rare, ~1 % of cases.\\n\\nIt complicates the situation that my husband has problems with his sperm and I should do assisted reproduction, which envolves stimulation of the ovaries ,which is not recommended if you have a tumor on your ovary.\\n\\nI may ask from my doctors to aspirate it even if it may be a tumor, even if it may get infected (because it is hemorrhagic, it gets infected more easily). I will take care of the tumor, if it is such, with anti-tumor diet (pigment rich plants etc.), herbs (essiac tea, bitter herbs), and of the infection, if any, with antibiotics.\\n\\nThere is also a new anti-cancer therapy called photodynamic therapy: the patient takes photosensitizing agents (extracted from pigments of plants) and the tumor is lighted. The cells of the tumor get destroyed by the reactions occurring between light and the photosensitizer. The normal cells are damaged to a much lesser extent or not at all.\\nIt is being experimented as therapy. I suppose the alternative therapies using beetroots, purple grape, carrots and other pigment rich plants use the same principle.\\n\\nThis method would spare my ovaries.\\nI am on the end of my first cycle of contraceptives and I get very tired, moody from them. Under their influence I hardly enjoy sex.\\n\\nI hope this ends as soon as possible.\\n\\nMarion\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHello Marion,\\n\\nCystadenomas are not cancerous growths.  They are cysts that are neither follicular nor corpus luteal.  Basically it is like having a cyst on any other part of your body.  I have done a lot of research on this because this is what is suspected with my cyst (it had not gone away after five months) and all of my research said that these are harmless cysts that do NOT turn cancerous.  There is an extremely small risk that they may be cancerous (something like 1 to 3 percentage) but if they are not already cancerous they will not become cancerous (ie. like hepatic adenomas which are benign liver tumours that have a small chance of becoming cancerous over a 10-15 year period).\\n\\nAs for the pill, it is now known that oral contraceptives are ineffective at either preventing ovarian cysts or at hastening their disappearance.  This used to be the treatment of choice back in the 80\\'s and early 90\\'s but they are considered ineffective nowadays.  There are many recent studies that show this to be so and I am surprised that doctors are still using this to treat ovarian cysts.  I have recently gone off the pill after twenty years of use and I suspect that my cyst developed either due to the pill or due to the effect of my going off of it (ie. my ovaries were overly stimulated when I went off the pill).  Had you already been taking the Clomid when they found your cysts ?  If so, perhaps it is the fertility treatment that caused your cysts.  Have you been informed of the risks that are associated with taking this fertility treatment ?  Ovarian cancer is one (due to the over-stimulation of the ovaries) just as conversely oral contraceptives reduce your risk of this type of cancer (believed to be due to the fact that you reduce the number of monthly ovulations you have over your lifetime .. ie. the opposite of the fertility drugs).  However, oral contraceptives increase your risk of breast and cervical cancer as well as your risk of developing a very rare and benign liver tumour (this risk is increased by 40 times !  from one in one million to one in twenty five thousand .. still rare but ..).\\n\\nAspiration of the cyst is another option but they would have to go through the uterus to get to the ovaries and I don\\'t personally like this too much.  I think they would have a much better view with laparoscopic surgery than with ultrasound assisted imagery.  They would also be able to take the cyst out completely rather than leaving the \"sac\" in there increasing the chance that the cyst will recurr.\\n\\nIdeally it is of course preferable for these things to heal on their own and for the ovaries to reabsorb the cysts but if this does not happen we ultimately have to make the decision to either live with periodic ultrasounds or if the cysts begin to grow or change to have them removed.  I have found this to be the most difficult to cope with and for now I have chosen to keep an eye on things.  Believe me though, if cystadenomas, or abnormal cysts or neoplasms (meaning simply new growth and nothing else) had a risk of turning cancerous, doctors would always recommend their removal and this is not the case.\\n\\nTake care and good luck with your decision.\\n\\nEstria\\nHi Estria,\\n\\nI know cystadenomas are not cancerous, but my actual concern is preserving my fertility.\\n\\nI finished my first course of contraceptives and I can feel by touching that the biggest cyst has grown.\\n\\nI know that contraceptives do not treat cysts but they are supposed to help the ovary heal by resting it. In my case, I have a weak liver it seems, and the contraceptive makes it weaker, which helps the cyst grow. Before doing this cycle of contraceptives I tried once Femoden contraceptive and got very sick by the 5-th day. I stopped it. My doctor got very angry when I said that I stopped it.\\nMy relatives are all pushing to do what the doctor is asking, so I had to try the contraceptive, if not for anything else, to show that it is ineffective.\\nI have 2 cysts in the breast as well, which may be fibroadenomas, and I didn\\'t want to take the contraceptive in fear of them turning cancerous.\\n\\n\\nI was reading that other hormones are used as well to stop the cycles (GNrH etc.) and in one study after ~6 months of ovarian suppression endometriomas halved in size.\\n\\nI think aspiration is simpler and with less side effects than surgery.\\n\\nI have used in the past alternative methods to treat different conditions, but  with this problem they are failing me. My biggest problem is keeping my weight and keeping people from judging me (for my diet).\\n\\nI didn\\'t know that cystadenoma is treated through ultrasound guided transvaginal aspiration. Your doctors advised this procedure for cystadenoma, or in hope that it is not cystadenoma?\\n\\nI hope you resolve your problem as well.\\nMarion\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHi,\\n\\nActually when I first discovered that I had such a large simple cyst, I went and got a couple of second opinions.  My primary care physician thought that it was only a large functional cyst because I had just gotten off the pill after 20 years and he said that the ovaries become over stimulated after being at rest for so long.  I had serious doubts that such a large cyst could be functional so I went and had another ultrasound (internal this time) with a gynecologist and she did a doppler analysis and relooked at the cyst etc.. She said that although she was not worried about it being dangerous, she was worried about its size.  My sister in law then got me an appointment with her doctor who turned out to be a gynecological oncologist (not really the correct person to see under the circumstances).  He also was not worried and said that I could either wait or have it operated on.  Then he said that I could also have it aspirated.  He is the one who suggested aspiration.  When I went for my ultrasound 3 months later and the thing was still there, I saw yet another gynecologist (in my own town who has become my regular gynecologist) and she is the one who said that since it had not gone away then it must be a mucinous cystadenoma.  How she knows whether it is mucinous or serous, I don\\'t know (probably statistics).  She gave me the choice of watching it or having it removed.  She did not suggest aspirating it and all of the articles I have read said that aspiration is not a good option although I am not sure why .. I guess because the cyst may return.\\n\\nI am wondering though .. does getting pregnant concern you because the cyst may grow bigger during the pregnancy ? or is it because you think you cannot get pregnant ? I am quite sure that I am still ovulating despite the cyst and you probably are as well (ie. when not on the pill).  Also, my personal feeling about the pill\\'s effects is that it is more likely to screw things up than to allow the body to heal.  I firmly believe that the human body will automatically do what is necessary to heal itself.  The reason we need to intervene sometimes is because the problem is too great.  Playing around with the body\\'s hormones is definitely not a perfected science and I don\\'t think that the pill can do what is necessary to \"rest\" the ovaries (I have heard this expression from my radiologist).  Today\\'s pills are not effective at shutting down ovulation completely and women are still growing follicles on their ovaries.  However, when it comes time for the follicles to open and release an egg, the pills prevent that hormonal surge from occuring (ie. this is their anti ovulant property) .. so how on earth do we know that these damned pills are not actually CAUSING the cysts ?  If women are developing follicles and the pills are keeping us from ovulating, the follicles may remain there and grow from cycle to cycle without ever opening to release their eggs.  I have heard that some women actually have negative effects from taking the pill meaning that their cysts grow bigger instead of shrinking.\\n\\nDiet I think is probably a big factor and trying to minimize foods that encourage inflammation and maximize foods that counter inflammation is probably a good thing.  Loosing weight must also help and since my cyst was discovered I have lost 45 lbs (still want to loose another 30 if possible).  Don\\'t know if this will help but it will certainly help for other potential illnesses.  I also want to be in good shape in case I need surgery.  Excess weight encourages inflammation as does Omega 6 fatty acids .. these are found in practically any processed food that we eat so I limit myself to whole foods as much as possible.  Omega 3 fats fight inflammation so I have increased these .. olive oil, seeds and nuts etc..  I have also switched to organic, hormone free dairy (although by its nature dairy will always have some natural hormone since it comes from an animal) and try to limit my meat intake (smaller portions).  I have increased my intake of fruits and vegetables and decreased my alcohol and caffeine intake.  I recently signed up with an organic farm and pick up fresh organic veggies from a nearby location every week.\\n\\nDon\\'t know if any of these things will do any good for the cyst but I am certain that it is doing good for my body overall.  Perhaps with time, my body will get in really good shape and I will see a change in the cyst as well.  Who knows ?!  Someday they will find something that actually works against these things.  In the meantime, increasing overall health is really all we have at our disposal.\\n\\nBy the way, if you have ANY liver problems, DO NOT take oral contraceptives if you can avoid it.  Oral contraceptives are associated with a fortyfold increase in risk for a benign liver tumour (hepatic adenoma).  Check out the hepatic adenoma threads if you want to know more about this pill side effect.  Although the adenoma is benign, they usually recommend removal if it does not go away because there is a chance that this type of benign tumour can become cancerous with time.  When they remove it they also often have to take a part of the liver (part of which regenerates).  I was SHOCKED to find out about this side effect and all it said on my pill insert is that a certain symptom could signal a benign form of liver tumour .. it did not say that my risk of developing this extremely rare tumour was increased by 40 times if I took oral contraceptives.  In addition, oral contraceptives also increase your risk of cervical cancer due to HPV.  I have recently found out that pap smears not only are not 100% effective but also that they do not test for a specific form of cervical cancer that is glandular (pap smears only look at the exocervix and test for squamous cell cancer .. the most common type).  US doctors are now starting to do HPV tests in addition to pap smears but women over 30 are most at risk for this (less able to fight the virus off), despite having been in a relationship for a long time (HPV is insidious and can remain in the body for a long time).\\n\\nAfter having been on the pill for so long, I was shocked to learn about all of these things and consider myself lucky if the only thing I got from having taken it was an ovarian cyst (although I would have preferred to come off scott free).\\n\\nSorry this is so long and if you have gotten this far .. KUDOS !\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nEstria\\nHi Estria,\\n\\nMy cysts may be hormonally active (I have much less menstruation than used to have just a year ago; follicular cysts usually produce estrogen; luteal cysts usually produce progesterone; endometrioma infiltrate the surface of the ovary); they may physically prevent the egg to be taken by the fallopian tube; as they grow they push on the ovary and may damage it (I may already be at that stage) etc.\\nThey lower fertility as far as I have read. I do ovulate (because I measured progesterone and it showed ovulation). The 3 months after the first tentative to take the pill I didn\\'t ovulate I think (I had a mucous pattern as of PCOS for several months).It messed up my hormones for 3 months.\\n\\nI have not taken clomid so far. Because of my husbands\\' problem I will have to do assisted reproduction, which involves stimulation of the ovaries. And stimulating the ovary with the big cysts in it may cause the cysts to grow and further damage the ovary. If I do assisted reproduction without stimulation, since my fertility potential may already be low, I will need many tries and this is a lot of money.\\nThe situation is complicated.\\nI have been dieting (organic, whole foods, no medicines for anything etc.) since 2001 now.\\nMy advice is: green leaves, roots (carrots, beets, celery etc), easily digestable protein (fish, organ meat, poultry) are the best to eat.\\n\\nI consumed a lot of olive oil believing that it is good, but I recently cut it out and I have much more energy. Oil in any form is not whole food, it is the most concentrated food you can ingest (I think it is more concentrated than sugar).\\n\\nI also am cautious with sweet fruits. They are whole, but they cause me blood sugar problems and they are usually hybrids, much sweeter than the fruits that existed 100 years ago.\\nSleep is my best remedy. Napping and falling asleep with dawn stimulator in dark room.\\n\\nI think the liver can heal the cyst. I took bitter herbs (dandelion) for a month and my breast cysts seemed to disappear (I didn\\'t feel it lumpy, like before), but after I stopped it they returned.I had to stop the dandelion because I felt it made me allergic (I do not know to what). Perhaps the liver got tired of extra work and allergies developed as a result.\\nI will try Essiac tea. It has anti-tumor effects and it has bitter herbs in it.\\n\\nIn one theory in the internet they said that cysts form due to inflammation process and hidrostatic pressure from the liquid (the pressure induces proliferation of the cells). After the cyst gets over a certain size the liquid pressure does not play any more a role in its getting bigger, only cell proliferation. Taking the liquid out helps the cells not to continue multiplying, so it may explain why cysts resolve after aspiration.\\n\\nAlso I read somewhere that the immune system has an easier fight against small tumors (it recognizes them better), So, by aspirating the cyst it gets smaller and the immune system may fight it better.\\n\\nMarion\\nHello Marion,\\n\\nHmmm ... you have some very interesting ideas there.  I too believe that cysts come from a inflammation process and that once they get over a certain size the body has a much harder time fighting it.  The diet suggestions that you made are very interesting and I have seen the suggestion of eating foods like beets and carrots somewhere else as wel.  It is certainly worth a try.\\n\\nIf you do decide to go with aspiration, please come back and let us know how it goes and what the process is like.  It is rarely suggested by doctors and I have always wondered why.  Perhaps you are right about surgery paying more (!).  So much for medical ethics, eh ?\\n\\nEstria\\nHello,\\n\\nIt has been some time since I posted. Here is my follow-up:\\nI took contraceptives for 3 cycles. I began the second round of contraceptives at the 8-th day after the last pill, so with delay.\\nAfter the first round of contraceptives the smallest cyst was gone, the bigger one had gone bigger, to 9 cm*6 cm. After the second round, the remaining cyst had gone to 8 cm*4cm. After the 3-d round of contraceptives, at the 2-d day of withdrawal bleeding the ultrasound showed that a  new cyst formed where the cyst had gone, the bigger cyst remained unchanged at 8 cm*4 cm.\\nAt this point I stopped taking contraceptives. I did an ultrasound two weeks later and the bigger cyst from 8*4 cm had gone to 4 cm*2.5 cm. That is a four-fold decrease in volume in two weeks. Some days before the ultrasound and some days after it I felt period like pains at the site the cyst is. The pains began around ovulation time.\\nIt has been almost a month since my last ultrasound and I feel my stomach flat, no pain in the ovaries. My cycle has gotten longer, to 29 days. My ovulation happened later in the cycle, around day 16 (it happened around day 13 before the contraceptives), luteal phase 13 (it was 12 days before the contraceptives).\\n\\nSo I guess the cysts are gone, or have got so small that they do not impair the function of the ovary. They must have been functional.\\nWhat I did different this time is that I took hot baths and did aerobics during the fertile period, to increase blood circulation to the ovaries. I took salvia officinalis and ate fruits in abundance so as to increase my estrogen levels. I suppose as a result the ovulation was stronger and because of this the cysts went away/got smaller.\\nI read in the leterature that rupture of the follicule to release the egg is hypothetised to be an inflammatory process.Everything that would prevent inflammation would delay ovulation. So me stopping consumption of olive oil may have helped as well, because olive oil reduces inflammation. Increased estrogene helps with the inflammation during rupture of follicle as well.\\nThey say anti-inflammatory non-steroidal drugs cause unruptured follicle, which may turn to cyst.\\nPerhaps the bitter herbs I used before were not helpful, because I read somewhere that when you feel hungry all the time your fertility is impaired, and bitter herbs make you feel very hungry.\\n\\nIf i will again have functional cysts, I will take care of them the same way.  No operation for sure, and no aspiration.\\n\\nAs for the cysts preventing me from falling pregnant as the doctor suggested, I think he is wrong because I read the ovum can be picked up by the fallopian tube even in the peritoneum  fluid, so a cyst wouldn\\'t prevent ovum pick up.\\n\\nNow we are trying to fix my husband\\'s oligospermia with diet.A lot of anti-oxidant, vitamin C, zinc rich foods. Let\\'s see what improvement we will have.\\n\\nWhat about your cyst Estria, what did you do about it? If it is cystadenoma like the doctor suggested I think a diet rich in antioxidants (beetroot, green leaves, carrots), herbal teas (essiac, dandelion, chicory etc.), vitamin C should help.\\n\\nAlong with the cysts I have a small fibroid as well. It was 2 cm before I began the diet rich in anti-oxidants and stopped olive oil. It got to 1 cm one month after the diet.\\n\\nHave a nice day,\\n\\nRita',\n",

       " {'post': \"I first went to my doctor because I'd had a period that lasted for 12 days continuously, heavily, and after seeing her I continued to bleed on and off (4 days on, one off, a week on, two days off etc) for the next month.\\nI had some tests for blood sugar etc, which came back normal, even the scans of my ovaries were normal, but my gyno said that it is PCOS because of the strange periods and put me on metformin.\\nI also had to stop the pill- this was 4 days ago now, and now I'm bleeding again. The gyno said that I probably wouldn't get another period for 2 months at least-- should I be worried? Is this really PCOS?\\nYou're probably bleeding again because you just stopped taking the pill.\\n\\nYou CAN have PCOS without any signs of cysts on your ovaries.\\n\\nYou'll probably find the metformin to help with your symptoms and I was TOLD it will make your cycles more regular. Did your doctor test your testosterone levels? If they are high you COULD take yaz or yasmin. Both are known to lower testosterone levels. I'm on both metformon and yasmin (two months so far) and so far so good. I've even lost 15 pounds!\\n\\nAs for my periods -- I've NEVER had a regular cycle. My periods were usually non existent for months and when i was younger I went around 18 months without a period...then last fall I started bleeding every two weeks. I had a period right after I went on the metformin and it was pretty easy compared to what is usually is, except for some cramping on the first day or so. However, I started the yasmin right after that and went into a new pack without taking the inactive pills and now that I'm on week two of the second pack, I'm spotting quite a lot...so I'm not sure really what a period for me is going to be like on the yasmin, but we shall see.\\n\\nI'm having my testosterone levels tested again next month to see if they've gone down, so we shall also see if the metformin/yasmin combo is working!\\ni had to go off the pill to clear my system of the hormones before the doctor would do a blood test, so i have to wait for that.\\nbefore all this happened i'd tried a tonne of different pills (to relieve BAD period pain) but nothing worked. i can't remember if i tried yasmin or not.\\nYou helped ease my mind anyway, thanks a tonne.\\nJust have to wait for a few months until I go to the doc's again I guess!\\nWell, if your testosterone levels are out of whack, which they most likely are if you have PCOS, yasmin or yaz will lower those levels (yaz is stronger than yasmin). I've been on metformin with the yasmin for about 2 months and I'm already feeling better\\n\\nI also have a friend who would bleed HEAVILY for days on end and ended up in the hospital from too much blood loss. She was diagnosed with PCOS and was put on metformin and the pill (not sure which one, probably yasmin or yaz) and the bleeding subsided. She also lost 40 pounds as of the last time I saw her and the thinning of her hair had started to go away...so hang in there! It's most likely your testosterone levels that are causing your problems. Once you figure that out and get them back to normal your extreme bleeding will probably subside!\",\n",

Last year I lost thirty pounds in one week. Ironically, that week was also the week my son learned how to walk.

       " {'post': \"Hi,\\nI'm new to this board and to having PCOS.  I've suspected that I have had it for a while but wasn't able to get it confirmed until last month.  My biggest concern however is the change my period has taken the past 2 months.    The Mirana was recommended to me but I have to wait for my insurance in August.  I'm not on any medications or any type of birth control (besides condoms).\\nOk...My period has taken a lot of strange turns over the years.  The last several years my period has lasted 2-3 days, (usually 2)  and has been VERY painful.  I've even blacked out before.  They came randomly.  Sometimes within 4 weeks, sometimes months would lapse between them.  The doctors never really knew what to do except tell me to go on BCP.  I've been on them before and it didn't help.  Now they really don't know what to say.  Well, things changed last month.  My period started and I had no idea.  No cramping, no pain, nothing.  It started out brown..gross.  It continued brown...gross.  It was very light with occasional clots.  It lasted 12 days!  The doctor recommended that I take a pregnancy test and it was negative.  This month my period was on time (very strange) and again with the brown blood.  I'm on day 7 with no end in sight.  Decided to try another preg test and again negative.  Along with all the other PCOS things, being really tired-hair growth in strange places-acne...a lot of acne-depression-the weight struggle etc, I really don't know what to do.  Has anyone else had to deal with periods that lasted FOREVER and looked as though they were just finishing up despite the fact they weren't?\\n\\nHelp please.\\nThank you.\\neverything you just wrote sums me up totally.. i have hair all over.. i have had my period for 2 months straight now, it did go away for 2 days, but came right back.. my periods are now like brownish too,.. i am always negative on pregnancy tests too...  im always negative on all std tests, so im so lost.. my fertility dr even did a endometrio biopsy on me, because 3 months ago i wasnt getting my period for 8 months straight, but that came back normal.. that test is to test for cancer in your utherus. i was not shedding my lining for along time, but now my periods wont stop.. really weird.. i am only on thyroid medications only.. i refuse bcp and pcos pills, to many side effects.. im just so worried im never going to have kids.. also i get very dizzy and lightheaded too.. most be from the crazy amount of bloodloss i have been having in the past 2 months.. i just never have any energy, and have packed on lots of weight.. i am tall though, but real heavy. i am just always tired everyday.. well i was diagnosed 10 years ago, but the reason i developed my issues was from years of bipolar/depression medications that i no longer take, but the doctors want me to take.. lol... my body is all screwed up.. whats your daily life like.. well  nice to meet you.. my name christina by the way.. hugs\\n\\nHi Christina,\\n\\nMy name is Crystal.  Daily life is not too bad.  I'm tired a lot but I can't fall asleep.  It's like living in a weird fog.  I wake up at 7am and can't get to bed until well after midnight.  I try not to take naps because I only stay up later when bed time comes around.\\nI'm very self conscious about my acne and facial hair.  I always feel like I might have missed a hair and someone is going to notice.\\nI hate being fat.  I used to be thin.  My sister and mom are thin.  My sister is getting married in November and I'm her maid of honor.  I'm dreading it.  I don't want to be in a dress or have any pictures of me.  Especially next to my very fit, very beautiful sister. I just want to let you know that I'm not going for pity...I'm just venting.  My sister thinks that losing weight is easy.  Just get on a treadmill and things should be fine.  I know she doesn't understand the tiredness or the effort needed or the sadness or the self consciousness involved.  Oh well, I will get through this.\\n\\n\\nI actually wanted to update this a bit.  Yesterday I was excited that my period was over.  My boyfriend and I 'celebrated' and today I'm bleeding A LOT.  I am SO TIRED OF THIS!  This is the second or third time that this has happened.  He's not hurting me and everything feels great at the time, but the next day, I start bleeding all over again.  I think I'm going to go to Planned Parenthood this week.  I don't have insurance until school starts up again.  Maybe they can help me.  I figure someone someday might.\\nwow i was always skinny my entire life too, but now forget it. i am always tired constantly too.. you are not alone with that.. like its so easy to loose weight. everyone thinks just hit the gym and that will answer all my questions.. i tell you i went consistently to the gym for 4 months and didnt see any drastic changes.. lost a few pounds, but then my body went into limbo and wanted to gain all the weight back that i had lost.. thats the problem with weight loss, its to hard to keep it off forever.. i wouldn't blame you for not wanting to wear a dress, because i havent wore a dress in like 9 years. I dress very baggy most of the time.. Good luck with yuor sisters wedding. doesnt that suck that our periods go away for like 2 days, but then come right back the next.. i dont even think my period does go away, i just get like brownish color those 2 days, but very light then its hardly visible.. i am so depressed and tired constantly too. i have no energy for nothing.. i try to eat healthy at least, but i also have sugar issues that makes me constantly craving something sweet every hour.. about the sleep issue your having, maybe your thyroid is low. do you have any psychological issues.. i have bipolar, but will not take any medications anymore for that condition. used to, but refuse because thats what caused my pcos in the first place-being on bipolar medications has caused my pcos, so i no longer take bipolar pills.. what is your situation caused from.. do  you work or go to school or have any kids?\\n\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I have posted on this issue here before, but am more confused then ever and need some advice, if possible.\\n\\nI am a petite (5\\'2 115 lbs), 23-year old female who has never had periods on her own.  Currently, using birth control, I have them whenever I want.  Provera was used to start them up.\\n\\nLast year I saw a reproductive endocrinologist.  He did hormone tests and told me that I do NOT have PCOS and there\\'s just a missing connection between my brain and my ovaries.  He says that everything is right up top and everything is right on the bottom, but the two aren\\'t communicating to give me periods.\\n\\nHOWEVER, I have done lots of research on PCOS and am not convinced I don\\'t have it.  I may be thin and my hormone levels may be normal, but I have always had bad skin and have never had a period on my own.  Aren\\'t those fairly telltale signs?  I guess I\\'m wondering if there is a surefire way to know if you have PCOS or not, and what to do if you DO have it so you can get pregnant in the future.  I am so scared that hesitating now may make it impossible to have a baby in the future, even though all three doctors I have seen assure me that, with medication, it should be no problem.  Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated!!\\nIf your endocrinologist did hormone tests and told you that you don\\'t have it, I\\'m sure he\\'s correct.  I was diagnosed with PCOS after hormone tests.  Usually, the egg cannot break out of the ovary causing the ovaries to become cystic.  My skin was clear, but I did have these chin hairs (luckily I\\'m fair); could stand to lose 20 pounds, etc.  You\\'re certainly not overweight, do you have any unusual facial hair?\\n\\nHave you had your thyroid checked?  You might look into that, and I\\'d certainly would go back to your doctor if you\\'re that concerned about future fertility, if only to inquire about it.  Best of luck to you.\\n\\nBTW, after being on the pill for awhile, my periods returned and have been regular for years...oh, and I do have two children that were conceived even though I had symptoms of PCOS.\\n\\nActually they are finding that even if the hormones check out fine one can still have PCOS.  There are some women who actually have no signs whatsoever and can still have PCOS.\\nWas an ultrasound done? That can sometimes detect PCOS if hormone tests dont show anything.  But you have to have a great tech and doctor to look at the ultrasound to know exactly what they are looking for.\\nIts funny because recently I am in the process of being diagnosed with PCOS.  So far the only signs for me is my cycles started getting strange and I was gaining some weight even though I havent changed my diet or activities.  We are still waiting for my Testosterone test to come back.  The test so far that came back funny was my FSH level.  But we are going to retest that here soon to make sure it wasnt just a fluke.  Then the next step for me is ultrasound.\\nMy doctor told me that there are some women who may not show signs of PCOS through their hormones but their bodies will show it other ways.  It is just a matter of checking everything possible.  Even then there isnt a surefire way to tell for sure.  Some things it seems are just that way.\\nThanks to both of you for replying.\\n\\nIt\\'s just so frustrating because deep inside, I really do believe that PCOS is my problem.  Why else wouldn\\'t I be ovulating?  \"I don\\'t know\" is just not an acceptable answer to me, and that\\'s all the doctor gave me!\\n\\nI don\\'t have any excess facial hair, and my skin has really cleared up since I was a teenager.  He did an ultrasound and didn\\'t see anything, though he had a VERY hard time finding my ovaries because they were so small and regressed from not ovulating.  He didn\\'t mention anything about seeing cysts, but he didn\\'t push it too much because he could see I was in extreme pain.  See, I also am EXTREMELY sensitive \"down there.\"  My gynocologist says my body acts as though it is constantly doing Kegals (sp?)  My muscles are so tight that I can\\'t relax them to allow her to take a pap test.  She says this is a major sign of sexual abuse, but I certainly don\\'t recall any such trauma!  It\\'s very frustrating, because I go through major pain just having a pap test (and that\\'s with the smallest speculum!).  I\\'m not sure if that relates to my internal problems in any way.\\n\\nShe suspected I might have something called Kallmann\\'s syndrome, because I also have no sense of smell.  Anyone know anything about this?  After doing research, I kind of doubt that\\'s the case because I don\\'t fit the profile for that disease whatsoever.\\n\\nSigh.  Well, I guess I\\'ll set up another appointment with this doctor and ask him about my results.  As I recall, he took tests of my thyroid, hypothalmus, and pituitary and came up with nothing.  What\\'s left to look at?\\nQuote: \"My muscles are so tight that I can\\'t relax them to allow her to take a pap test.

It\\'s very frustrating, because I go through major pain just having a pap test (and that\\'s with the smallest speculum!).\"\\n\\nBoy, I\\'m very surprised your doctor suggested sexual abuse to you like that!\\nGeesh, hasn\\'t she heard that it can be from just plain nerves?  If it makes you feel any better, I was exactly the same way before I lost my virginity.  I was petrified of the doctor using the speculum and remember it hurting so bad that he stopped, and I assure you, I was not sexually abused in any way during my life.  I think some women are just more sensitive, as you put it.  To this day, even after having two babies, I tense up when I have my annual exam.  Everyone is different when it comes to exams, and you and I just happen to tense up like that as I\\'m sure many other women do.\\nI generally like the specialty of Reproductive Endocrinology for being the better informed Doctors of the whole group of specialists we sometimes need.\\nHowever, just because one Doctor is a Reproductive Endocrinologist does not automatically make him infallible.\\nI\\'d get a second or a third opinion on that PCOS thing if my inner voice were telling me to keep looking.\\nHonor your unrest.\\nI\\'m one of those thin sisters myself.\\nMy telltales signs are bad skin, and not just on my jaw line, and tight muscles.\\nAmoung other things.\\nMy RE used the Glucose Tolerance Test for my definitive.\\nI am now taking Glucophage(Metformin)for my Pancreas.\\nIt\\'s made a wonderful and huge difference in my life.\\nThe Pancreatic function with relation to the ovarys is one of the big problems.\\nRemember. PCOS is the S in SYNDROME. And Syndrome means many symptoms coming together. You could have some or all or none but the Doctor will call it as they see fit to be what they use for their guideline for their own practice of medicine.\\nIt\\'s largely a matter of diagnostic preference.\\nkat\\n\\nKat....does the glucose give you regular periods?  I feel so barren and unwomanly knowing that I have never ovulated.  I guess I would like to find SOME way to get things started down there so I am assured that my body will be able to do it when I need it to!  When you say the glucose changed your life, how did it do so, if you don\\'t mind sharing?\\n\\nAs for the sensitivity, I appreciate that information as well!  The thing is, I don\\'t really feel nervous about my exam.  Also, I am very comfortable sexually with my boyfriend (though we are waiting to have intercourse until marriage).  I don\\'t feel like I\\'m tensing up, but she makes it sound like I am CONSTANTLY tense down there.  Maybe that has something to do with my stress level....I suppose I am a high strung person, if I really think about it.\\n\\nAnyway, thanks for your answers.  I am going to visit my reproductive gynocologist again and see what he has to say to my questions, and perhaps get a second opinion.  Maybe I will have him try another ultrasound to look at my ovaries?  I really appreciate all you have said...every bit makes me feel better.\\nEddie, The condition is actually Insulin Resistence.\\nWith Insulin Resistence the cells in the body are not receptive to the Insulin the Pancreas is producing.\\nThe Pancreas will tend to over produce insulin in the body and that hyperproduction of insulin causes a lot of body problems.\\nHyperinsulinemia produces a problem called hyperandrogenism. That means that the body gets stimulated to over produce Androgens such as Testosterone. It\\'s the excess androgenic hormones that interfere with ovulation and fertility.\\nIf the cells are made to be more sensitive to the Insulin produced by the Pancreas then the Pancreas will stop the over production of Insulin and the theory is that the androgens will grow less prominent.\\nThe medication used to facillitate insulin sensitivity of the cells is Metformin(generic) or Glucophage(brand name) This medication is the same medication given to diabetics for their Insulin Resistence.\\nAdditionally some women might already be Diabetics so that needs to be checked.\\nBoth Diabetics and Hypoglycemics have the problems of Insulin Resistence. The difference is that in the Diabetic the body has already stopped producing the required Insulin and in the Hypoglycemic the Pancreas is still in hyperproduction mode. Glucophage/metformin (the medication) is often used as a preventative medication for people who have Hypoglycemia to keep the Pancreas from going into failure and moving on into the progression of Diabetes.\\nI hope I\\'m explaining this right.\\nIt gets a bit complicated.\\nI no longer have any ovaries at all. I had everything removed due to a huge disaster of problems.\\nI am still on Glucophage for my Insulin Resistence.\\nThe addition of the medication to make my body cells more receptive to Insulin has made a huge difference in my whole body dynamic.\\nWe are still in the process of refining and defining body problems but so far the medication helps to keep me out of so many body crisis\\' like feeling spacey or irritable or simply not feeling well. My energy levels are better. There is less pain in my body and the wild Palpitations of my heart which have earned me a hefty dose of a Beta Blocker to control my mysterious palpitations have started to come under better control.\\nI am not having near as many bouts with blood pressure crisis that I have had since the Hysterectomy a year ago. I\\'ve only been on the medication since November.\\nThe big thing I just recently noticed is that I can now eat Oatmeal and Banannas with out throwing myself into a whole headachey mood slide edged with hunger and dizziness. It was pretty bad at one point.\\nWith regards to your pain, that could be a related but somewhat different problem.\\nThere are two things that come to mind when talking about pelvic pain.\\n(1) Adenomyosis. That is internal Endometriosis in which the endometrial tissue grows into the muscle of the Uterus. It is very easily missed and a very painful contition. If left to grow the eendometrium grows and causes the Uterus to begome enlarged and boggy. And believe me when I say this condition is EXTREMELY painful and has absolutely nothing to do with abuse and everything to do with valid and horrible organic pain. Just because the Gynecologist can\\'t see it or feel it does not mean that it might not exist. As with pelvic adhesions, this problem usually can not be seen by imaging tests. I also had pathology tests done from biopsies and those came back clear too. My Surgeon wrote on her pre op report that I might have some slight Adenomyosis. The Pathology from my hysterectomy revealed EXTENSIVE adenomyosis.\\nSo it\\'s a real guessing game at some point.\\n(2)Endometriosis w/ Adhesions. This would be my next guess in the pain department. Also, where there is Adenomyosis there usually is some Endometriosis. And where there is Eendometriosis the body will often respond by producing scar like tissue called adhesions which grow as the endometriosis grows and eventually there are fibrous bands of stickey scar tissue that tend to stick the internal organs together.\\nI\\'ve had 2 surgeries in less than a year to address the problems of endometriosis and adhesions and I had one emergency surgery to address my colon which simply stopped working at one point. So this stuff just gets worse if you never get it correctly diagnosed and tended.\\nBecause the Bowels and the Bladder are often involved in the adhesion problem there are good aantispasmodic medications that help the organs relax enough so the person is not in so much discomfort. The colon and the bladder both tend to get spastic when something is irritating them and having either endometriosis or adhesions or both growing on their exterior is real irritating so then there\\'s a reaction.\\nThe anti spasmodics are really helpful so you might want to tak to your Doctor to see if maybe that will help.\\nWell, I hope I have not made this too confusing.\\nIt\\'s a big complex subject but more information is becoming available so hopefully better diagnostic tools will happen along.\\nkat\\nWow, your post was extremely informative and a bit overwhelming.  Lots of what you say rings true to my own situation, but some does not.  The pain I experience is really only external....right at the front of my vagina.  For example, when my RE went to take an internal ultrasound, it hurt a LOT as he put it in, but not at all when he was moving it around to see my uterus.  They both told me it\\'s just a matter of muscles that are clenched too hard, so hopefully that is the case!\\n\\nI\\'m interested to hear more about the colon problems you\\'ve had.  I had a colonoscopy last year because I haven\\'t been able to keep food in me.  I had horrible diahrrea (still have no idea how to spell it!) as soon as I ate dinner every night.  I am now on fiber pills and doing MUCH better...and the colonoscopy came out fine.\\n\\nMy blood pressure is very good (usually 90/60), my cholestrol is good (160 last time), but I do occasionally get dizzy spells for which I had an EEG last month.  Nothing showed up.  I have a lot of sinus infections/problems that may be causing the nausea and dizziness, but could this possibly be related?\\n\\nHave I also mentioned I have no sense of smell?  One doctor suggested Kallmann\\'s Syndrome, but that\\'s usually found in males and leads to an absence of developed sex organs and occasional mental retardation.  That doesn\\'t sound like me at all...other then no periods, I developed regularly and have a normal IQ.\\n\\nIt\\'s so frustrating.  Shouldn\\'t all these doctors be able to diagnose what\\'s wrong with me?  I just want to feel good, feel fertile, and be able to live a \"normal life.\"  My mom suggests seeing an osteopath to look at all my symptoms....have you had any experience with one?\\n\\nThank you so much, I really appreciate everything you took the time to write!\\nEddie, I have never been to an Osteopath. I have had a lot of very extensive Chiropractic work done to help deal with these body issues.\\nI\\'ve had many and different modalities with Body Therapy, I\\'ve had Acupuncture work done and even Hypnosis. Lots of alternative care work.\\nI\\'d have to say that each modality was able to contribute to the easing of some of the symptoms and body difficulties but largely, the problems were just as overwhelming to the less conventional of the healing professions as it was for the standard medical people.\\nSo I think there may be a whole cluster of problems that tie into eachother and proper diagnostics requires a bit more than just one Doctor.\\nRight now I am finding that the more my different Doctors work together,through me,that the answers are becoming more clear.\\nSo it is probably a really good idea to go ahead and see the Osteopath and see what ideas that kind of Doctor can come up with.\\n\\nIt\\'s totally possible that your pain could be due to muscle tightness.\\nThat would indeed be better than some of the other pelvic problems.\\nThe thing to remember about conditions in the body that are somewhat hidden, is that the pain that you feel is not always the location of the pain source.\\nInternal pain(visceral pain)tends to radiate and bring on a pain in another part of the body that often casts confusion on the pain problem.\\nWhen I was doing my own journey from Doctor to Doctor\\none of the Doctors I saw told me that my description of the pain did not make good anatomical sense.\\nThat observation about the location and reality of my pain helped the Urologist come to the decision that I needed a laproscope to investigate the mysterious pain root. My Gastroenterologist had already come to that same point of view with regards to the whole pelvic disturbence issue.\\nThere is just so much that can be causing a problem like you have described.\\n\\nMy Colon issues were/are a mess.\\nMy Colon was found to be wrapped around the left ovary and both the ovary and the colon were stuck up against the musculature of the pelvic girdle.\\nThe adhesions, that had endometriosis hidden in the adhesions,had to be cut away to free up the colon.\\nThe compromised colon along with that severely enlaged and painful Uterus created all kinds of problems.\\nMy colonoscopy came back as the picture of health.\\nFor me, it was the attachment of the Adhesions to the exterior of the colon that has caused my Colon to be spastic.\\n20 days after my hysterectomy my body elimination functions quit working.\\nNo bowel function and no urine function and my tachycardic heart was racing crazy wild and getting ready to check me out of consciousness.\\nSystems overload fail safe I suppose.\\nSo if it does turn out to be Endometriosis and Adhesions, it\\'s best to discuss treatment options with a good surgeon.\\nEven the surgery is not the best answer, but it sure does make a whole lot of sense when the destructive process has become such that life is being severely disrupted.\\nI didn\\'t know anything about Kallmans syndrome so I took a look on a search engine. I think you might be right about those symptoms. But it wouldn\\'t hurt to have the Doctor at least explore that thought if only to rule it out.\\nMy sense of smell changed drastically after I had my hysterectomy.\\nOne of the times I was in the ER with my colon acting up one of the ER doctors and I, got on the subject of ones sense of smell.\\nIt was his thought that my sense of smell had changed due to the shift in my hormones. So the lack of scent sense could be a hormonal issue with out being specifically Kallmans. But definately, I\\'d keep mentioning that body condition to the Doctors and just ask if they think it is of any significant information while trying to find the answers for your body.\\nMy sinus problems also got better and definately changed along with the whole hormonal shift.\\nI recently saw a Neurologist about my migraines.\\nIt was his opinion that a true Sinus headache is rare.\\nHe said that the most recent research was that more people are having a variation of a migraine that they were calling a sinus headache.\\nSo that\\'s just some food for thought to throw out there for one or another of the Doctors you see.\\nAlways good to ask their opinions.\\nBest of Luck with the new Healing process,\\nkat\\n\\n\\nWow, thanks again for your information and opinions.  You certainly have dealt with a variety of health issues, but prove the point that the textbook case is not always the situation.\\n\\nI will continue to get these problems looked at, and hope that my conditions aren\\'t indicative of some of the things you mentioned.  Thank you SO much for your advice and knowledge, you really are very helpful!\\nI think I have PCOS, even though several test showed negative. I did have very light periods, am slightly overweight and have problems with facial hair and acne. I was put on birth control(Yasmin) and told that if my ovaries did have cyst that this would make them become smaller. I am really curious to know if my ovaries are cystic, and would like to have an ultra sound. Should I have this done?\\nThe cyst/cysts may or may not show up on\\nimaging tests. There also seems to be a lot of debate on which kind of Cyst might be what is called a functional cyst and a cyst of concern.\\nIt\\'s just hard to tell sometimes.\\nYou will do better with having a consult with a doctor who treats PCOS and fertility problems.\\nReproductive Endocrinologists are Gynecologists who have their specialty in Endocrine disorders and the whole PCOS thing is really an endocrine disorder.\\nIf you get diagnosed the next part of the story goes with treatment and you would want a Doctor who knows what to do with the problem.\\nkat\\nEddie, I am a woman with Kallmann Syndrome, and I know what you mean.  I\\'ve looked on the websites and seen all of the symptoms I\\'m supposed to have, and that it\\'s mostly found in men, but I\\'m guessing that there are varying degrees of symptoms.  I don\\'t have a sense of smell, and I didn\\'t develop when I was supposed to (I had to take meds for that), and I also don\\'t have a period naturally.  I know you said that you developed normally, but I just thought I\\'d tell you my story, because I didn\\'t know that ANYONE else had it when I got my diagnosis.',\n",

I may a have a little good news for you. I also have PCOS. I went on BC after a year of not having  a period, and about 8 years of not know what was wrong with me. So, anyhow, the BCP I took for about 2 years. It helped to regulate my periods, which in turn, lowered my high blood pressure, headaches, and it helped me to lose the weight I had gained.

I was also just reading on how I could change my diet to help the PCOS in a positive way, and it said that a diet low in carbs is very helpful. When you eat a lot of carbs, the sugar is just stored in you body, the fat in your stomach. And just excercise. I am doing very well with this, and I hated noting being able to eat the foods that I wanted at first, but I got used to it.

Its frustrating. I went to curves for a whole year, but  the dr told me i was waisting my time and money until we get my PCOS under control. I take metformin 500mg 3xs daily.\\nOh its good to rant!  Its just not fair this pcos!!  I'm fed up with it too.  I've had it all my adult life, but I am so lucky too to be blessed with 3 children! Yes three even though I only have about 2 or 3 periods a year. Can you believe that!! My gyno said to me after I had my first child that I won the lottery and It won't happen again!  Maybe I should sue him?  (Only Joking)\\n\\nAs I'm getting older (35) the side effect of this pcos is getting worse!  The hairy chin, oh yes I can relate to that.  I have to pluck at least once a day.  Sometime a new hair will grow within hours\\n.  I'm sure I check that chin and it was clear, but no I must have missed it!  Fat belly, yes have one of those too. I was only asked twice last year when I was due!\\n\\nI suppose its nice not too have periods every third week, especially when I'm not broody.  But the thing is I'm always broody!  When people ask me if I'm having more, It would be lovely to say, yes maybe I will give birth next spring.  No I can't say that, I have to leave in Gods hands.  Do I sell the baby gear buy white carpets and think about a paid job for me? Don't know I may fall pregnant again, who knows.  But Ive been thinking like this for 4 years now, wanting to not make plans just in case I get pregnant.  When do I finally realise I won't get pregnant again?\\n\\nOr will I ??????\\n\\nwendy 2468 - hahahahah that was really funny ... and do count me to be a fellow sufferer.. it is nice to laugh at one's own problems once in a while..but must say you have been really lucky to be blessed with three kids!\\nI am PCOS/INSULIN RESISTANCE/THYROID/BIPOLAR ALL IN 1... I Developed thyroid and pcos and IR from years of bipolar pills that i refuse to take now due to all of these issues.. i have hair all over my face and chest and thighs. i talk like a man and i am very aggressive type.. i used to be very thin before i took bipolar pills. 120pds. once i took these bipolar pills i gained 200 pounds in a year and developed all of these issues. i have dropped some weight 50 pounds since then, because i stopped the bipolar pills, but man i cant even take metformin without a side effect of 30 times a day diahreea. its insane. i am so upset about my health.. i am always craving sugar all day long.. if i dont get my dose of sugar i cant function properly.. i can never loose weight no matter what diet or excerise i have done.. no luck.. can any body help me.. i am only 24 and never had any kids.. i have tried, but no luck.. my periods are all messed up.. sometimes i get a period twice a year. then out of no where i wont stop bleeding for 2 months straight.. Had an ultrasound done and a endrometrio biopsy, all negative.. my paps always negative.. i am so lost.. plus i am constantly going pee and doctor checks me for a UTI and its always negative too.. i just dont know what to do.. i even had a cat scan with contrast of my abdomen, because i had pains.. always negative even though i get constant digestive/bowel issues.. my whole body messed up.. i pray o have kids 1 day.. i just dont know..\\n\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi there,\\n\\nThis is my background:\\n\\nAlways had irregular periods (3-6 weeks between them). At 20 I went through a stressful time and my period stopped (5-6 months) and I got severe acne. I\\'m not at all overweight and doctors used this to discount the possibility of PCOS for a while. My bloodwork showed very low androgen binding hormone and consequently high free testosterone. Ultrasound confirmed PCOS. I went on the pill and spironolactone to regulate my periods and tackle my acne. The improvement on the acne was really dramatic and it really quickly disappeared (leaving me with scars though!). Eventually I decided to stop the spiro and thankfully my skin stayed clear.\\n\\nSo I\\'m on Diane 35 at the moment and it\\'s probably ensuring my periods are regular and my skin is clear...but I REALLY want to come off the pill because I hate not knowing what my body is really like. I really want to know the truth.\\n\\nIs there a chance that the stressful period in my life brought on the symptoms and now that things are more on track, I may not have such severe symptoms? My diet is probably a bit better, having eliminated white bread and being aware of the affects of sugar.\\n\\nI really really want to go off the pill and see whether I get periods again and whether my skin is okay (I can tolerate pimples but really couldn\\'t handle going back to having severe acne). I\\'m so so scared of what I might discover though. I\\'d be devastated if my period never came on its own...I don\\'t want to just depress myself.\\n\\nOne day I want to have kids and I don\\'t want being on the pill for so long (so far 5 years) to reduce my fertility further than it already is from PCOS.\\n\\nWhat do you recommend? Should I go off it and see what happens, or should I keep my head in the sand and wait until I NEED to go off it (ie. to try to conceive)?\\nHi El,\\n\\nI have had PCOS for years. I am 43 years old now and just went off the birth control pill. I have been on and off the pill since I was sixteen years old. I had alot of issues with bleeding, 9 months straight once. The only time I went off was to try to get pregnant. I was on the pill for 8 years before I tried to get pregnant. I had alot of help with fertility drugs and surgery to get pregnant. I do not think being on the pill made it harder for me to get pregnant, I know it was the PCOS. I did go on to get pregnant five times. I had 3 losses and have two beautiful healthy children ages 14 and 8.\\n\\nThe only thing I can suggest is if you really want, try to go off the pill and see what happens. I know I tried going off a few different times because I was afraid for being on it for so long. My problems came back after stopping. I know everyone is different though. If you satrt having problems you can always go back on. I wish you the best. I have been there. I am so glad I am past all of this now. If I had to do everything over again I would in a heartbeat.\\nEl.....The doctors didn\\'t diagose me either until late because I am small....so when they ran the test that\\'s when they found out. I was on the pill a couple of years ago but came off b/c I wanted to conceive....My period is regular when it wants to be...maybe u can ask ur doc about metformin it\\'s suppose to regulate ur period.....but I think u should come off the pill\\nI was on Diane for about 10 years and went off it 4 months ago. My skin is going crazy again!When I was on Diane,my acne was under control and my skin was perfect. I dont want to go back on it as i have been on it for 10 years and really dont want it to effect my fertility. So just be warned that this could happen to your skin. I am now thinking of cutting out sugar and carbs and hope this works for me. Diane has been the only thing to keep away my acne in the past but unfortunately I cant be on this forever. My periods are also irregular now too. Maybe try to go off it for 6 months and see how you feel. Every ones body is different.\\nHi all,\\n\\nThanks for your tips. I decided to see a gyno before doing anything. She says that because I was diagnosed with PCOS 5 years ago, it is difficult to know if I have it now and how bad it is if I do have it. She told me to go off the pill for 6-8 weeks and to follow that with blood tests and an ultrasound. She thinks that my skin should be okay for that duration - she says it\\'s usually around 3 months post-pill when the skin gets bad again. Does that fit with your experiences?\\n\\nSo far I\\'ve been off the pill for 3.5 weeks... I\\'ve noticed some changes - no pimples yet, but my skin is oilier. I feel like I have worse body odour and I also feel much more anxious or nervy. That\\'s all I\\'ve noticed so far.\\n\\nI\\'m very nervous about my tests results. I hope they\\'re not too bad....only 4 weeks to go....\\nHi everyone,\\n\\nI just thought I\\'d post my experience.\\n\\nI went off the pill for 7 weeks before having an ultrasound and blood test. My ultrasound was normal but the doctor said that he thought it was normal purely because my ovaries had been asleep for 5 years while on the pill. He said that if I was to have another ultrasound in a number of months, then he\\'d expect to see cysts. That confused me - why did I bother with the ultrasound at all if all I could be told was \"they look normal, but they won\\'t\". All that was said was that the improvement from the pill was better than in a lot of cases (prior to the pill, I had >25 cysts per ovary).\\n\\nMy blood test revealed slightly elevated testosterone and all my female hormones eg. estrogen were way down but my doc claims that is just because of the effects of the pill.\\n\\nI didn\\'t get any periods in that time. The doctor said I could stay off the pill for another 8 weeks and repeat the blood tests and see whether I\\'d get any period....so that\\'s what I did. I stayed off the pill for a total of 3 months.\\n\\nI just got my bloodwork back this week and it\\'s quite disappointing. I think I was stupidly hoping that PCOS would disappear seeing as my symptoms did while I was on the pill. My free testosterone has continued to increase. My estrogen is at menopausal levels (that worries me but my doctor didn\\'t dwell on it). I\\'ve had no periods at all which is really disappointing. I feel like my BO is bad. I also feel like I\\'ve got bad discharge which I had when I was younger and didn\\'t realise that it\\'s disappearance coincided with the pill. Thankfully my acne has not returned at all, though my pores are definitely worse.\\n\\nI guess I\\'m most disappointed that I\\'ve not got my own period. I\\'m worried I won\\'t ever be able to conceive, not that I\\'m in a position to want to any time soon.\\n\\nThe other thing my blood revealed was that my insulin/glucose/lipid levels are all normal so there is no evidence of insulin resistance yet. My doctor still claims my body probably doesn\\'t respond properly to high GI foods and she warns me off them...but I find this HARD.',\n",

Im ne progesterone right now, so I'm trying to figure out if me feelign hungry (and I'm serious, the worst hunger I have ever felt...not just munchies or whatever) is the meds or PCOS. Anyone else get that hunger?\\nWell i have always had hunger issues i would say lol!!! i can't really pin point it to pcos or being on progesterone. I do know that being on it made me very sleepy!!! Did u have that side affect also???\\nYES!!! Me too.  The worst hunger I have ever felt.  It is so unnatural, and almost like no matter how much I eat, it will not never quench it.  I am not on Progesterone though, only Met.  I am not overweight, but I am insulin resistant, and it seems like I feel that way when I do not eat right on schedule, and my blood sugar gets a little low, and when I feel like that and I eat it jumps up.   But, I never felt that feeling until I started Metformin.\\nHi Ladies:  Among the many things progesterone did to me, hunger was definitly one.  Think of it as PMS on steroids.  Just be careful, because as I learned from experience, PCOS tends to lessen your ability to lose weight.  I did not know that back 20 yrs ago when I was first diagnosed. I gained about 10 pounds in about 2 months.\\n\\nI'm not saying you shouldn't satisfy the hunger pangs, just try to do so with things that are lo-cal and can be metabolized quickly.\\n\\nGood luck and hang in there.  cmpgirl\\ntell me about it!!!! i am hungury 24/7 i could eat for england. it all satarted when i started my periods and i never really thought about it untill now so thanks.\",\n",

       " {'post': \"hi everybody I'm new here\\nI'm Brandy, 27 from oklahoma married and trying to concieve our first child. I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 21. Up until now I've had very little treatment because doctors around here just dont understand or they dont care. I started skipping periods a few years ago and my doctor prescribed progesterone which helped... now upto the present time... a few months ago I again started skipping periods so I started using over the counter progesterone cream and that helped to bring them back. I've also used Vitex, Soy isoflavones, prenatals, cinnamon, dong quai... uhmm the list goes on and on. Right now I'm doing just progesterone and soy. On April 10th I have an apointment to FINALLY get fertility testing done! I'm so excited to finally be doing something about all this and moving in the right direction to concieve.\\nHi Brandy,\\nPCOS is something that needs to be handled by a gynecologist, family doctors and general practicioners have little to no experience with PCOS as I've found and generally aren't very up to date with the latest treatments. There are a number of treatments out there, the one I currently am on and has worked from the very first month I started is Metformin which is also used to treat type II diabetes (though I am not diabetic), it treats insulin resistance which is associated with the syndrome and a lot of the hormonal issues are resolved with it. I used to go months without a period as well and since being put on this treatment I have had periods regularly almost on the same day every month! Fertility treatments are a big help, but you also would want to directly treat your PCOS because there are life long risk factors by letting it go...My gynecologist informed me and also through all the research I've done I've learned that untreated it can actually lead to ovarian cancer down the line in some cases and other health complications. Also miscarriage in women with PCOS who aren't being treated is reportedly 30%+ higher than in women without it. I would definitely treat your PCOS issue first and foremost and really speak to a gynecologist.\\n\",\n",

I was taking medication for the hypo thyriodism and i continued to gain wieght, however, once i started taking on a 1000mg of medformin i lost 24llbs since starting it 3 months ago. So maybe you might need to get you medication readjusted and continue eating health and working out and hopefully soon the wieght will start dropping off.\\n\\nBy the way I was 161lbs at 5 ft tall and i still not a healthy wieght for my age which is 27.\\nHi There,\\nMy heart is out to anyone struggling with weight and other issues.  I am 61 years old and discovered the truth about refined carbs and refined sugars about 4 years ago.  I used to love sugar and all kinds of desserts.  My weight kind of crept up there to where I was 194 pounds, but at 5 ft 8inches, it was too much for me.  Then I was told that I had elevated blood pressure.  I went into panic mood.  I started walking, but wanted to go off sugars.  I came across this book, \\'The New Sugar Busters\\',Cut Sugar to trim Fat Authors(H.Leighton Steward, Morrison C. Bethea, Sam S. Andrews, Luis A. Balart by Random House publishers in paper back  which is my guide, costing about $8.00 U.S..  I now understand that the refined carbs (low fibre foods) and sugars cause the body to create insulin.  These high levels of insulin decrease the level of glucagon (hormone from pancreas) that takes fat out of the body.  As well, the high levels of insulin cause either the pancreas to give up sending out insulin or make the cells resistant to insulin, impeding the absorption of sugars and causing high blood sugar levels.  Low fibre carbs burn up too fast, causing the rapid increase in insulin levels.  Too high a level of insulin over sustained periods are the culprit.  From 1994, (since having a lower bowell xray), I made it a point to have oatmeal porridge every morning, no matter how disgusting it is.  It is a high fibre carb which breaks down very slowly and doesn\\'t cause big spikes in insulin levels.  As well, for the last 5 years, I put freshly crushed organic flax seed onto the oatmeal.  The organic flax is an excellent source of omega 3, which is good for the mental well being, the heart, and prevention of cancer.  I have not missed one day since 1994.  Incidentially, my weight came down to about 165 and is now about 170 pounds.  I started an exercise program about 4 years ago.  When we walk, we cause the insulin levels to go down, which in turn increases glucagon (the fat burner).  The timing of meals is so important as well.  We don\\'t want to eat too close to bed time normally, as our insulin levels will not have time to come down before we retire for the night.  A walk after a meal is a good way to get the insulin levels down.  As well, a glass of water in the morning to dilute the bile (preventative to gall bladder problems) and several other glasses of water during the day will remove toxins and make us feel better.  We should also have oral hygience, as flossing a couple of times a day plus especially before bed (brush floss brush) will give us that good feeling in our mouths, and help us to feel better about ourselves.  As well, the flossing prevents build up of plaque which can even enter the blood system.  If we don\\'t floss, we get the build up the gums, and this can cause gingivitis.\\n\\nIncidentially, when you read the New Sugar Buster book, it gives you a new mind set, to really hate refined sugar.  I purchased about 20 of the new Sugar Buster books as I am a Lion\\'s member, and could purchase them to sell for a fund raiser.  But with the first group of 20, I have just given them out to my children (all 6 of them) and to friends of the family.  I just have such a burden for those with the weight problems, who don\\'t have these simple facts, that could empower them to get to their ideal weights and stay there.  I don\\'t crave the sweets as much now.  Instead I have nuts like almonds, or plain yogurt.  My wife makes a rhubarb (no sugar) oatmeal crumble that I have occasionally.  Every goody that I don\\'t have, is one more tool to keeping my body to the right weight and cutting the blood pressure.\\n\\nFeeling better is a journey.  It is my ambition to help people in that journey. So spread the word.  Telling people about sugar busters is the tool that helps me overcome the temptation to help myself to doughnuts, cake, etc.  The doughnuts and cake are so much a part of our social fabric, even in the Churches, that we need to overcome with great diligence.\\n\\nMy prayers are with you and with all those with similar struggles.  I am cheering you on in the fight against big sugar and big chocolate.  You don\\'t need them.  The commercials are just to seductive.  They always show these skinny healthy people, and it makes people think that it is perfectly all right to eat all these candy bars, and doughnuts, etc..  It doesn\\'t bother me now that I will never eat another chocolate bar, doughnut, or ice cream cone, as long as I live.  I want to live \\'healthy\\'.\\nLove,\\nBrian 234\\nI forgot to mention that my second daughter had pcos.  She was only 22 years old.  It was devastating to me.  I did some research.  The extra weight that she carried was a problem.  She got onto an exercise program and started with the omega 3 fatty acids.  She got a good check up with it about a year ago.  I guess that I am a constant nag about sugar.  But at least, my 6 children know that I love them enough to nag.  Only my 14 year old son is still at home.\\nwas on metformin last year and too many side effects of 20 times per day diahreea or more.. doctor switched me too like fortamet i believe, and it does the same thing as the metformin, constant diareeha.. any help or suggestions? i cant cope..\\nItalia, I just posted in another thread about your situation.  Hopefully you will read it.  First, I will say it here also....you need to be taking your Synthroid daily!!  I can not imagine refusing to take a medication that is to help replace something your body desperately needs.  Your thyroid can\\'t make enough hormone and you need that hormone replacement.  Nothing in your body will work right without it.  You have to get this under control otherwise you will have a very difficult time with anything else.  At least you are fortunate enough to know what you need....there is nothing anyone can say or do to help you if you won\\'t even take care of something that you desperately need to function properly.\\nhey all.. i have been taking my sythroid a bit more now.. about every other day now.. my periods never stop.. had them 2 months straight now.. im so worried i can never have kids, due to abnormal periods.. took metformin and the subsitiute for metformin, and both made me go diahreea 30 times per day.. i need help with this whole pcos thingy.. how am i ever going to have any kids.. i have so much facial hair and a goatee, i look like a boy in the face.. its insane.. i have such a masculine voice and aggression persoality.. im just depressed, i dont know what to do anymore.. someone please help..\\n\\nSeems like you still don\\'t understand that the Synthroid is NOT something you take when you want to.  IF YOU DON\\'T TAKE AS DIRECTED YOU WILL BE SICK.  You have to have it daily PERIOD.  You may\\nget to have children if you refuse to take the hormone your body can\\'t make properly.  I hope that wakes you up to how important it is to take this medication.  Many with hypothyroidism also suffer with severe bleeding....you may find some relief once you take your Synthroid daily.\\n\\nHave you tried diet therapy?  Apparently gluten and sugar reduction has had tremendous effects on women suffering PCOS and infertility related to PCOS.  You may find great results by changing your diet.\\n\\nDon\\'t know what other options are out there besides what you have already gone through.  My advice would be to talk with your doctor about another treatment plan that includes diet and medication.  Be open and honest about your concerns with medications.\\n\\nAGAIN, getting medical help won\\'t do you any good if you refuse to follow the advice of your doctor.  I still can\\'t understand why you won\\'t take your Synthroid on a daily basis....it\\'s not going to hurt you!!!  It will help you feel better!!\\n\\nYou should have your labs, including a full thyroid panel, run.  Since you haven\\'t been taking your Synthroid regularly you may need an adjustment on the dosage.\\n\\nI can\\'t imagine anyone else can give you any answers as you already won\\'t take a medication that you know your body has to have in order to function.  It\\'s almost like talking to the wind.  I don\\'t mean to sound harsh as I truly hope you realize how much damage you\\'re doing to yourself by neglecting this important aspect of your body.  If your thyroid is not functioning and your body is not getting the hormone it needs then nothing else can help you until you become responsible and take your Synthroid daily...as directed.  And a couple of days of taking your Synthroid isn\\'t enough to see how it works for you.  This is a long term medication that needs to be evaluated yearly for possible dosage changes.  This is a drug that you will need to take everyday for the rest of your life.  Until you get this straight you don\\'t need to be prescribed any other meds as you are likely to do more damage to your body.\\nDON\"T WORRY ABOUT NOT HAVING KIDS! you\\'ll have them, and you\\'ll be fine. My sister went through what your going through, pcos and all! I have pcos, so i can help with that side. As far as your meds, take them! it doesnt matter how annoying they are or how forgetful you are. I went 2yrs without taking meds and it was 2 yrs of hell. Now still no meds but thats because my docter had to get blood tests. Oddly enough I started ovulating normally on my own and have had normal periods. Now as far as the having thyroid and pcos problems, here goes......My sister had pcos since she was like 16, she took her thyroid meds and stopped taking them for like a year and a half. She got pregnant without them, but had to start taking them when she got pregnant or her body would reject the baby. So you should start getting used to them now. As far as the diarreah on the metformin or gluco watever your taking; I\\'ve taken practically all of them, Some of them have side effects like diareahh, upset stomach, vomiting, just eat them with something lite, not a whole meal. When you take it eat a piece of toast or milk or something. The diarreah will stop. Either that or wait it out, it only lasts a week. But what is a week opposed to a lifetime of health problems. btw.........taking one med for each illness (pcos and thyroid) is not bad for your health, it will actually help you....if someone doesnt understand what your going through they cannot help you. Their wasting their breath if they have to say \"I don\\'t understand why you can\\'t take your meds\" When i was younger (i\\'m 21 now) I couldn\\'t take my meds because I was so in a rush to have fun i forgot about them. I\\'m not saying its okay to not take it, but that its harder for some people and not everyone will understand. All we can honestly do is pray for you to get the encouragement you need and be happy with what your doing.\\n\\n..........godbless\\n\\nvanessa\\nI feel you on everything. I could have written your post for the most part. I\\'m 27, 5\\'6, 250 lbs. I have PCOS and bipolar. I was taking lithium for bipolar and that messed my thyroid up for awhile. I dropped the lithium (with dr. approval) and my last tests were ok. Since I started  taking drugs for bipolar I gained about 50 lbs, mostly due to taking seroquel. I\\'ve never had kids but want some more than anything. Several times people have assumed that I have children, which upsets me. I just started metformin a few weeks ago and had some side effects.\\n\\nI started taking classes to become a foster parent. I\\'m going back and forth over having biological kids right now due to being bipolar and not knowing if it will happen with PCOS. It\\'s something you can look in if it interests you. They are lots of children out there that need someone who can make them feel safe.\\n\\nA great snack that my husband and I love are frozen grapes. Just rinse off and freeze. They are so good and a great snack anytime, especially in the summer. They make a great dessert.\\n\\nAre you in any kind of therapy? Even if you choose not to take any meds, it\\'s good to talk to someone and get everything out. I\\'ve tried several different meds and finally have found some things that seem to be working for me mentally. I know that side effects are terrible. Seroquel has worked great for me, but it causes excessive weight gain. I just take it, because I need it to have a half decent life and my husband can\\'t stand me off my meds. I just tell myself to bear with the side effects because they won\\'t last forever and I need the benefits of the drug.\\n\\nI don\\'t really have too much to help you with. But remember that you are not alone. I understand what you are going through. Finding the right doctor is a big help. I just moved and still haven\\'t found any doctors (mental & physical)  that I like. The best doctor that I had made me so mad at every appointment, but I realized that she really cared about me.

Those symptoms are all possible when you're about to have your period and can start a week or so before it actually happens. Your body is constantly changing hormonally so the clomid could've sparked a change that's causing those symptoms...\",\n",

Because as 2Plus1 said, just because your cycles are very regular doesn\\'t necessarily mean that you are ovulating (though I hope you are!). To be sure, chart your cycle, and when you think you may be ovulating, use an ovulation test kit.

I got pregnant after my 4th month of Clomid.\\nHi Barton, I sure wish the clomid had worked out for me, tried 8 rounds of it with nothing, will be trying the metformin and Letrozole soon, possibly ovarian drilling and/or injections after that. I\\'ve read some of your other posts and you sound really knowledgeable about pcos, how do you think it is someone like me can have regular 31 day cycles year after year and never ovulate? They used to be 45 days apart or sometimes I would skip a few months, but have regulated more over the past few yrs, wonder if that means I\\'m getting better? Oh well, I go back to the re in Jan, hopefully he will have some options for me. I hate this pcos!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There, that felt better\\nThanks for your reply, em\\n\\nHi Emily.........PCOS can be very tricky.  The first thing that every PCOS woman should do is become educated so that you know what you are up against.  Now, I\\'m sure you know that there is NO cure for PCOS, but it can be managed once you know what you are dealing with.  If you are overweight, oftentimes, women will find that losing weight makes it MUCH easier to control your PCOS symptoms.  Symptoms may not go away........but they do appear to become less intense.  Stick with your RE.  You are in the best hands as far as a specialist goes.  Trust that you will get your wish because it CAN happen.  You are not doomed.  Just stay strong.  My best wishes to you................and yes, I have researched PCOS to death, so if you have any questions...............don\\'t hesitate to ask.\\nHi Emilycaitlin,\\n\\nI am a fit and healthy 24 yr old, and after a short spell in hospital for a kidney infection and ultra sound picked up a cyst on my ovary.  So I was sent for further investigatory tests - internal scans, hormone tests etc.\\n\\nI was diagnosed as having PCOS, both ovaries.  I was also told that the hormone test confirmed this and that it was unlikely that I ovulated because I had an extremely long menstrual cycle.  The fact that my mother (who has had four children) has a 38 day cycle appeared to be irrelevant.\\n\\nThis was at the start of September.  I spent many hours crying with my partner about the diagnosis because we wanted lots of kids!\\n\\nSo here we are, the 24th of November, and I am now five weeks pregnant.  I know it is very early days, but I doubt that this happened to be the one time I ovulated....\\n\\nThey can be wrong, so relax yourself and enjoy the trying!\\nHi,\\n\\nI also have pcos and endometriosis and i have been pregnit 5 times, and i now have 3 great kids. the first 2 i needed clomid and the 3rd kid was a surprise, we were not even trying in fact we were done at that point. So i say yes it can happen, it sure did for me.\\n\\nGood luck to you\\nI have PCOS and I was wondering if when you went on cholmid were or are you overweight?  I am overweight and am trying to lose weight it is so hard. I am not on chlomid i am on anastrozole, metformin, actos, and now going on injections\\nHi BioClock,\\n\\nNo I wasn\\'t oveweight when I took my clomid. I\\'ve heard some women with pcos have had good results from the Atkins and also the South Beach Diet, maybe you could check into those? Maybe the met will help too, I got a script yesterday for it but haven\\'t filled it yet. I\\'ve never heard of those other meds you are on, what type of injections are you starting if you don\\'t mind my asking? I\\'m always on the lookout for something I haven\\'t tried that might help me ovulate.\\n\\nI know there is something about pcos that makes losing weight very hard, not sure but something about insulin resistance I think, the met is supposed to help with that so maybe after you\\'ve been on it awhile it will get easier. I do hope they work out for you and you are able to get pregnant very soon. Best of luck to you\\nem\\nHey girls,\\n\\nI was recently diagnosed with PCOS as well even though I have known I had it for years. No doctors would listen to me. I started my AF when I was 10 yrs old and it stopped at 12 yrs. I am now 28 yrs old. The severe acne and severe migraines started about this time and this is also when I started gaining weight. I was put on bcp at 15 yrs up until 24 yrs on and off. When I wasn\\'t on the pill I never got AF. So according to my RE based on my hormone levels she said clomid would never work and that I must start on injections (Repronex) but my chances with that is about 10-15% of getting pregnant, she wasn\\'t very optimistic. I am not severely overweight but it is extremely hard to lose weight. Well I am in the process of doing the injections (intramuscularly, ouch) and hoping to do my first IUI next week. Sorry for the novel but my point is that I think instead of just clomid or metformin, I think trying the injections would be better.\\nIt is definitely a very hard thing to digest emotionally, mentally and physically.\\n\\nI have personally know women to have gotten pregnant with PCOS, but with my research it sounds like there are so many different situations with PCOS and I have also read there is no specific blood work to diagnose PCOS, doctors just diagnose it based on symptoms and hormone levels. This is so frustrating!!! Well I hope that I didn\\'t bore you and that I was able to help. But I think we just have to keep trying. You know what really bothers me is that I have asked many doctors over the years if me not ovulating would be a problem conceiving and they all just said, \"Oh, we will just give you some medicine and you will have babies!!\" Well good luck and please don\\'t give up. It seems like there are many women on this site giving us great and wonderful support. With out this site I think I would have just given up. I pray everyday for each and every one of you girls to have happy and healthy pregnancies. We can do this!!\\n\\n\\n\\nLots of love,\\n-Jenn\\nI have PCOS and am currently 13 weeks pregnant. I used metformin for about 8 mths lost about 26 pounds and my cycle went from every 3- 6mths to every 35-40 days.. still not that great, but better. I had a cyst that the doctors thought was on my ovary, it ended up being on my fallopian tube, they removed cyst also did ovarian drilling. Immediately after surgery I felt my hormones change and my cycle was perfect for the first time in my life.  During surgery the doctor took a look at my other reproductive organs and told me after everything looked great and I should be pregnant in a month. I also took a low dose of clomid after and was pregnant a month later.  Two years ago I miscarried and it had been a challenge ever since. After the miscarriage we took 5 heavy doses of clomid, without any results.   I\\'m so excited now, and everything thing is fine.. A long process, but we will see.\\nHi everyone!  I don\\'t know if i have PCOS but my doctor had mentioned it.  i\\'ll give a little bit of my story if u all don\\'t mind.  i started my cycle when i was about 14 i would have a period anywhere from 3 to 9 to 12 months apart.  got on bcp at 17 to regulate and it worked.  til last oct doc changed my pill then jan 06 i had my last period.  didn\\'t worry cause dh and i weren\\'t thinking about kids til may.  got off the pill and nothing.  finaly got in to see the doc in oct, took a dose of progestin and had a cycle.  then nothing.  i started spotting on 30 nov and 5 dec had a real period.  docs don\\'t want to talk to me cause we haven\\'t been trying for a yr yet, but i told them what about no cycle.  i could understand if i had a cycle and just wasn\\'t having any luck!  so finally they r gonna do some blood work.  i have a hard time loosing weight, i\\'m 24 and get acne like i\\'m 15 again sometimes.  i don\\'t know, its so frustrating!  well sorry for the story...thanks for listening!!\\n\\nHi girls, wanted to thank you all for sharing your stories and words of encouragement.\\nJenn, your story sounds soooo familiar. I was told by my first re that I should use repronex, but I would have only about a 25% chance of getting preg. with it, not per cycle but for 4 months! I felt devastated and since my ins. wouldn\\'t cover tx I couldn\\'t justify paying that kind of $ for such a slim chance. They also told me clomid wouldn\\'t work for me, after I\\'d already had 8cycles of it, I pretty much knew it wasn\\'t going to work by then, ha ha! I really hope the injections work for you, and I totally agree that more aggressive forms of IF tx, such as injections and the like seem to have better success rates than when drs just push clomid and metformin endlessly. I know clomid and met have worked wonders for alot of ladies with pcos but they haven\\'t for me. You\\'re right we do just have to keep trying and not give up. Keep me updated on your progress, hope everything works out for you\\n\\n\\nLertise, that\\'s wonderful news you are pregnant now especially after all the past struggles. Ovarian drilling has been recommended for me as well and I think it would be a good idea, just haven\\'t done it yet. I hope you have a very happy and healthy pregnancy!\\n\\nBabyluv, I hear ya about the acne! I\\'m 29 and still get it like a teenager during my cycles. Sorry you are having to wait a year before drs will do much of anything but that seems to be pretty standard unless a woman is over 35. Maybe you will get some answers from your bloodwork though. Lots of luck to you! Take care\\nem\\nHi Emilycaitlin\\n\\n\\nI understand everything that you\\'re going through.  I did the clomid, the shots, and metamorphine and nothing worked.  The met would make me sick to my stomach.  So they put me on Avandia and that worked great without any side effects.  I had ovarian drilling done in July of 02.  I finally got pregnant in Feb of 03 and delivered a healthy baby girl in Oct of 03.  It took us almost six years before I got pregnant.  I think what did it that time was the Leterzole.  I know that drug has worked on so many women that were trying to conceive with PCO.  Now my husband and I would like to have one more.  I just hope and pray it doesn\\'t take as long as it did for the first one.  I\\'m going to call and make an appointment tomorrow and we\\'ll go from there.  Take care and good luck.  It\\'s going to happen just pray and believe\\n',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi everyone.  My name is Lori and I am 31.  I was diagnosed with PCOS in my early 20\\'s after multiple miscarriages, extremely long and heavy periods, and many many months of trying to conceive.  Not to mention the hairgrowth on my face and bad skin.  Now I have two beautiful children, Thanks to a wonderful doctor and Clomid.  I no longer have acne and the hairgrowth on my face hasn\\'t really gotten any worse although I pluck and wax and everything else you can think of.  It is finally manageable.  One thing I do not have under control though is my weight.  I am grossly overweight.  I have been on Metforminin the past, but it didn\\'t help me to lose weight.  I have also tried a multitiude of prescription diet pills only to be plagued with nasty side effects.  I am 5\\'0\" and weigh 230.  It\\'s awful.  I desperately want to lose weight.  People look at you like you are lazy and a slob, but in reality this disease has prevented me from shedding the pounds.  I have never been this heavy and first started gaining weight and never stopped when I was around 22 the same time I noticed the hairgrowth on my face.  Back then the hairgrowth was terrible.  I was a mess.  I am a very active person, but my one downfall is carbs.  I know that they are the root to the whole problem of me not being able to lose weight.  Does anyone have any good solutions as to how to curb my carb cravings?  I desperately want to get and stay healthy for my children.\\nHi Momof2: I can relate to the weight issues. I wanted to ask if your doc ever sent you to an endocrinologist?  The inability to lose weight with PCOS, is usually due to a slowed down metabolism.   An endo is the best person to help evaluate metabolic rate.\\n\\nIn my case my metabolism was really slowed. So I began walking every night with my husband.  We started slowly and  gradually worked our way up to a power walk. It wasn\\'t immediate, but I slowly started losing a pound here, 2 pounds there....and I eventually lost 40 pounds. I have kept it off for 10 years and I\\'m not even walking anymore, due to a serious back injury.\\n\\nThis is just my experience, but maybe it could work for you.  I hope it was helpful.  Good luck,  cmpgirl\\nHello Momof2!\\n\\nI went to see my OB/GYN about two weeks ago (about my PCOS) and complained of the same thing. I\\'m 34yr old, 5\\'3\" and 270lbs. As a side note - My husband and I have no children nor have we tried ttc yet - another reason I visited my OB/GYN. I\\'ve had a weight problem my entire life and I\\'m sure PCOS since 10 when I started menstruating.\\n\\nI\\'m wondering if you have acanthosis nigricans,  patches of darkened skin on the back of the neck, under the arms, and/or in the groin area. I discovered, not too long ago, that it is a sign of high levels of insulin which means one is most likely insulin resistant even if it isn\\'t showing up on tests. My fasting glucose level is 75 - within the normal range but, I have many other symptoms of insulin resistance including acanthosis nigricans. I\\'ve had those dark patches since puberty and remember my mother trying to scrub off \"the dirt\" on my neck with rubbing alcohol (poor thing had no clue).\\n\\nSo, given all these factors my doctor suggested a low carb/paleo type diet. I\\'ve been reading a load of book on this subject. To name a few\\n. It\\'s quite fascinating and as soon as I heal from a recent tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy (needed thanks to allergies - I swear there is a connection between allergies and my insulin levels...I digress).\\n\\nTo answer your main question, It seems one has to keep their fat intake high and protein intake moderate - high in order to survive a low carb diet. We have it drilled into us that fat is bad. Many are now arguing if even saturated fat is as bad for us as \\'they\\' say. It seems many people follow a low carb diet but still go along with the low fat idea. Most ultimately begin to think low carb doesn\\'t work but, the key many maintain is keeping your fat intake high, carbs low (and that depends on the person - you have to experiment with the grams daily to figure out what works for you) and the protein moderate to high.\\n\\nI\\'m going to give this concept a good honest try to see if it works. It will be hard to not keeping thinking things are too fatty but, I have nothing to lose. None of the traditional diets are working for me. I\\'ll go to my GP in 6 months and have a CBC done. Of course, my fear is that my numbers will go through the roof but remember triglycerides may be fat in the blood but, they\\'re caused by carbs.\\n\\nCan you tell this has been on my mind a lot recently.\\n\\n\\n~Danielle\\nHi momof2,\\n\\nI can relate to just about all of your symptoms, including the facial hair growth which I\\'ve had since I was 12 (now early 20\\'s). I\\'ve done laser treatments to no avail and end up shaving on a constant basis. I\\'m also the exact same weight as you and have been up and down with my weight for years (120lbs. just 3 years ago!). Since I started on my glucophage (metformin) last year it has helped and I\\'m not gaining rapidly at all anymore. As soon as I started changing my eating habits it has also helped. Talk to your doctor more about the weight issue or your gynecologist may even be the best person to speak with because a good portion of it is hormonally related.',\n",

Your symptoms sound similar. I don\\'t know about PCOS, because it has a lot of other symptoms that you did not mention. The darker blood is usually \"older\" blood that builds up when you skip periods, or have ones that are too short and not enough blood is being expelled.\\n\\nMy advice would be to make an appointment with a good OB/GYN and tell them what your history has been. They can do ultra-sounds and non invasive biopsies to see whats going on. Especially if you are young. It\\'s always better to find these things out sooner than later, so you can get necessary treatment.\\n\\nGood luck and keep us posted.\\nThanks !\\nwell i have an appt with my gyno. tmrw thursday so i\\'m hoping to find some answers. some of the other symptoms i have are pointing to PCOS becuase i have dark patches on my neck, under arms, inner thighs, and between the crease of my breasts.

So to be on the safe side i stopped takin the pills\\nThanks again cmpgirl !\\ni\\'ll keep you guys posted on how my visit goes.\\n\\nPCOS is pretty easy to diagnose.  Do you have excessive hair on your face? If you get an ultrasound they will be able to see the \"cysts\" on your ovaries.\\nAlso, I\\'ve never heard that the pill will make PCOS worse.  I was diagnosed w/ PCOS 13 years ago and was immediatly told to go on the pill. There is a lot of info out there about PCOS b/c it\\'s so common.\\nI\\'m not sure I understand what you are saying about bleeding before intercourse (???), do you mean after???

Help once more.\\nhello again lbh02,\\n\\ni am not an expert or a doctor but i do have some experience at fighting this crazy syndrome.  you may want to find a new doctor.  i say 2 gyno's and they said there was absolutely nothing they could do for the pcos.  then i happened upon a doctor who's passion is skin but she has also become my regular md.  she told me on our first visit that metformin and a drug called spironolactone will get my hormones back in shape.  boy, was she right.  in fact my ovaries are so stimulated i get ovarian cysts when i ovulate.  but at least i ovulate!!!  i am done having children (thank goodness...hee hee) but i know that if i wanted to get pregnant im sure i could.  tell your doctor you dont want the bcp's and ask for the spironolactone in combination with your metformin.  it may take some playing with the dosage but it's worth a try.  anything is better than the pill!!!  once your hormones are getting on track your melasma should start to lighten.  you will probably always fight it, which is what i am finding\\n\\n\\nanyhoo, good luck.  and remember just cause he's an md doesnt mean you cant disagree with him and go to some one else if you dont get the results you are after!!!!!\\nacanthosis nigricans - darkened skin on the back of the neck, under the arms, and/or in the groin area. (It looks like creased darkened skin)\\n\\nI also have acanthosis nigricans. My mother would scrub my neck with rubbing alcohol to get the 'dirt' off. Of course, it does't come off!\\n\\nMelasma are dark, irregular patches commonly found on the upper cheek, nose, lips, upperlip, and forehead. (They look like sun/age spots)\\n\\nGoogle image the two - acanthosis nigricans and melasma (aka mask of pregnancy)\\n\\n-----------------------\\n\\nI'll speak of acanthosis nigricans since that is what I have.\\n\\nAcanthosis Nigricans often a symptom of PCOS and a sign of insulin resistance. I would have a Oral Glucose Tolerance Test or Fasting Blood Glucose Test to see if you are insulin resistant. I must admit that often these tests show normal levels the first time around. My levels always come out in the normal range but, I have every other sign of insulin resistance. My GP thinks I may just be on the precipice of IR which down the road can lead to diabetes if not taken care of.\\n\\nLook into books on insulin resistance and low carb dieting because that seems the best bet in regulating insulin levels. There is the ADA diet but, many, including most doctors now, believe the carb levels are too high even if the carbs are mostly complex/high fiber.\\n\\n~Danielle\\nThis is interesting, about a week ago I found a slightly reddish/darkish patch on my right inner thigh. When you push down on it i don't feel anything weird, it's not a bruise or anything and it smooths out upon applying pressure, but it seems to fluctuate between being very dark and light randomly. Can this be the same thing? My doctor didn't say anything about it and recommended me to go to to my dermatologist. Is there something else I should be asking about? I have normal blood sugar (102 last time I tested a week ago), no diabetes, but I take glucophage for my PCOS (1500mg a day).\\n\\nI don't know about melasma because I don't have that. You can find a picture of both these conditions through google image or *********.\\n\\nHowever, it doesn't sound like acanthosis nigricans. Acanthosis nigricans is more like a change in the pigmentation of the skin on either or all of the following areas: neck, underarm, hands/nuckles and inside of the thigh. Kind of like what chaffed skin looks like. It's not patchy looking or bumps but rather like those areas tanned or are a just a different skin color. Often it's on bending/joint areas and looks like,honestly, dirt-like.\\n\\nThe pictures are no doubtably better at telling the story.\\n\\n~Danielle\",\n",

So you can be preg. Or just a simple thing like stress. I've noticed with my birth control, if I dont take it my cycle just goes on and on and on. You could possible need birth control to treat it too. The most common treatment is birth control and metformin. You should make an apt with the Dr.\",\n",

       " {'post': '\\n\\nI\\'m 25 years old. Got Mirena IUD inserted April 2005 as a \"last resort.\" I have been on BCP for years until I had a DVT blood clot in December 2001. Taken off of them, got rid of the DVT with treatments.\\n\\nApril 2005 period went from bad to worse...extremely heavy bleeding, passing many blood clots in 30 minutes at a time, loss of blood, and it was just a mess. It happened before back in 1994 and they stuck me on BCP back then. This time around, they put the Mirena IUD in me due to blood clot history. It was either that or do the ablation (spelling?) or another option that would cause me to never have kids.\\n\\nBefore the IUD, they did the biopsy and it was fine. After the IUD, I saw a big change in my overall body. The bleeding stop...well should I say slow down, stopped, and came back. I had the same full heavy bleeding until about September 2005 (5 mths after insertion). Then afterwards until now, I would go bleeding for a week-two weeks at a time every day and then be without a period for a few days and back having a period for a day or two at a time and then stop.\\n\\nAlong with the bleeding, I gained weight (10 lbs) even with exercise and eating right. In July, I started to have low back pain that has yet went away. I also became very sleepy all the time and acne became a huge problem that I hadn\\'t have in years. My legs are also swelling up a lot as compared to before.\\n\\nBecause of my back troubles, I had MRI\\'s done in August, November, and March. All showed cysts on both ovaries. I had ultrasounds as well. In one year, I had a major increase of cysts on my ovaries as compared to beforehand. I do have Polycystic Ovaries but the IUD seemed to make it worse. The GYN that inserted the IUD really didn\\'t have an answer for what was going on and all I got told was \"it was normal.\" Not only that, she tried to get me to use the patch (even knowing I had a history of DVT) and said that it wasn\\'t a big enough dose to cause a blood clot. My pharmacist thought otherwise and the new gyn thought otherwise because the old GYN tried to give me double dose than what is recommended! I don\\'t know what she was doing...and this gyn is supposively highly regarded since she teaches at the local university. Boy were they wrong!\\n\\nI went to a new GYN and talk about a big difference in care! She\\'s carefully monitoring the cysts, my diet, everything. She did an ultrasound and my uterus lining is too thick and really hasn\\'t thinned any since I\\'ve had the IUD last April. She said that she feels the Mirena IUD is doing more harm than good for me given with my past. She tried to manually get the IUD out this past Monday, but without success. She said that the string was cut way too short and it was hard to get a grip on it. She went ahead and did another biopsy to make sure nothing else was going on. All that fooling around in there really was a painful experience.\\n\\nIn a week and a half, she is going to use an ultrasound and then a pair of tweezer like things to pull it out. She said that if that doesn\\'t work, then I will have to have it taken out with an outpatient surgery.\\n\\nMy questions are:\\n1) Anyone have increase # of cysts being on Mirena IUD?\\n2) Did anyone have periods pretty much all the time and never stopped?\\n3) Which was worse, getting the IUD put in or taken out?\\n\\nMy number one piece of advice is to take some pain medicine when you get it inserted and when they do a biopsy because it is a very bad cramp feeling. Have someone to go with you in case you need them to drive or just for general support.\\n\\nAnyone have any advice of what I should do to help control periods, even with a past history of a DVT caused by BCPs??\\n\\nThank you in advance for your help and advice!!\\nI\\'ve been diagnosed with pcos and have had the iud inserted. The only problems I have with it is the cramps and gaining a little weight and then losing a whole lot more (every woman\\'s dream but I think it\\'s a pain wearing baggy clothes or buying a new wardrobe).\\n\\nEverything that you have said is NOT normal. The first gyn is a quack. Listen to one that is saying that the iud is causing you harm because it is.\\n\\nWith an iud, a gyn won\\'t remove it unless it\\'s either been a year since the insertion or if you are having complications from it. Talk to your gyn about removing it. To me, it seems like you may be getting an infection along with other serious problems from the iud alone. The reason why I think you may have an infection is because of the back pain and whatnot. Of course, I could always be wrong because I am not a doctor.\\n\\nJust talk to your new gyn about the possibility of removing the iud or alternate ways to help you keep the iud.\\n\\nI\\'ve never had my iud removed, but it can\\'t be that much worse than getting it put it. I have a friend that had the iud and said it wasn\\'t a pain when she removed hers, but it\\'s different for everyone.\\n\\nHang in there. There\\'s nowhere you can go but up on this one.\\nAloha.  I also have PCOS and have had the Mirena IUD/C in for about 1.5 years.  I decided to have the Mirena placed in my uterus after a long battle of trying to regulate my period and to ovulate.  I took BCP for years, and \"the ring\" for a short while because of side affects such as swollen feet and legs.  Then after being off a hormonal method of birth control, my periods also stopped.  I went to a woman that practices Chinese Medicine, who suggested Vitex to regulate my period.  I took it for less then a month and got a period, and then my period arrived every month.  Soon, I went in for a pap smear and I was ovulating at that time!!! It scared me so I tried the pill again, which made my periods come twice a month.  So I tried a copper IUD wich got expelled.  Then I tried the Mirena and was very happy with it.  Now, I have some serious acne and swollen feet.  I believe it\\'s because of the Mirena.  I want to get it removed and talked to my OB/GYN  and they don\\'t understand why I want to remove it.  I am considering trying to conceive also.\\nAny suggestions on what to do and how to approach my doctor again????\\n\\nI can\\'t answer all of your questions, but I can tell you about the removal of the Mirena.  Sounds like your situation is alot like mine.  My string was short and retracted.  I wanted mine out before a year and my OB/GYN did not have any issues removing it.  I never heard that you had to keep it in a year before they would remove it....doesn\\'t make sense.  If you decide you don\\'t want it they should take it out even if you don\\'t have complications.  Anyway, mine was slightly embedded in my uterus (couldn\\'t tell by routine ultrasound), but my doctor was able to get it out with ultrasound aid.  I was not given any local anesthetic and it did feel a bit like going through labor.  My GYN was only doing this because I was tolerating it well and I begged him to get it out without having to go the hospital.  He told me he would give it one more try and then we going to have to surgically remove it in the hospital.  Thankfully he got it out on the last try.\\n\\nI would highly recommend getting a local if your doctor  is going to attempt the removal in office...unless you\\'re prepared to go through labor like pains.  If the doctor is not successful after a few tries, then by all means have it surgically removed.  It\\'s not worth the risk of infection.  Also, if there is alot of digging in there to get it out, make sure you\\'re put on an antibiotic to prevent infection.\\n\\nYour removal will probably hurt worse than insertion.  Insertion is not supposed to hurt too badly.  It will be okay though....sounds like it won\\'t be any worse than what you\\'ve been going through.\\n\\nHope you feel better soon.\\nIF you wan to have your IUD removed all you have to do is schedule and appointment for removal and get it done.  Tell you doctor this is what you want and be firm.  They shouldn\\'t make you feel like you\\'re in the wrong to get it removed.  You are in charge of your health and this is your decision.  This is a form of birth control and I can\\'t imagine a doctor not allowing a woman to make this choice for herself.',\n",

       " {'post': 'I am having some health problems, but am not sure if this is related to my other illness or if this is something altogether different.\\n\\nI have always had regular periods, every 28 days, lasting for 3-5 days. First 1-2 days are normally heavy with minor clotting & minor cramping.\\n\\nThings recently have changed. My last period lasted & lasted & lasted & was super heavy â€” the heaviest longest period I had ever had in my 22+ years of periods (I am 33 & started at age 11). It would not stop so I called my pcp & she said to take ibuprofen. I took it a couple times & it did seem to slow it down. Then less than a week later, it started back up again. So I called again & was put on Provera (progesterone) for 10 days. I stopped bleeding 2 days into the medication, and I was relieved. Then 2 days later, it started again. This time, it is mostly all dark poop-colored brown and a bit thicker than usual. (There is no weird smell or burning or itching or pain or anything like that.) It is not like a normal period at all. And it is still happening. This morning, it\\'s more red, and heavier.\\n\\nI have been on my period for the last 27 of the last 33 days. It\\'s nuts!\\n\\nI do have a couple minor ovarian cysts that I was told would not really cause me pain or problems, but likely go away. I have had 2 positive ultrasounds, one back in August & one in February. I don\\'t know if this could be the culprit?\\n\\nI am also on prednisone & azulfidine for IBD (inflammatory bowel disease). I am not sure if the prednisone or IBD could be causing all these problems with my cycle?\\n\\nAny ideas? Anyone ever have this too? Why won\\'t the progesterone (provera) stop it? (Years ago when I went on Depo for birth control, I had a period that wouldn\\'t go away & I went on Provera for a short time & it worked great.) Should I worry?\\nWell, my PCP called me yesterday, now I am being referred to a GYN. More bills, great (I don\\'t have insurance).\\n\\nI will post when I know more....\\nUpdate: pcp called & told me the pelvic pain I am getting is probably due to the cysts. Seems the cyst(s) are bigger now & she told me the size: one is 4cm & one is 5cm (or it\\'s one big 9cm? one!?!). She said something about getting in to the gyno & they will probably want to do endometrial biopsy (I think she said?). I am bummed. I thought these were no big deal, that\\'s what I was told. I don\\'t want to do this. It\\'s bad enough I have the IBD stuff going on & have to have another scope up my bum, let alone this (I am a private person).\\n\\nI would love any input from anyone who has gone through this before....\\nHi Hukleberrie:  Ovarian cysts can be painful.  It depends on the person. Some women have terrible pain and some women have none.  It doesn\\'t mean the cysts are bad or good.  It\\'s just a matter of size of the cyst, a person\\'s tolerance to pain, where on the ovary the cyst sits, etc.\\n\\nMost OB/GYN\\'s just \"watch\" cysts under 9 or 10 cms.  They will have you come in for an ultra-sound about every 6 weeks for a while to see if they are growing or shrinking.\\n\\nProvera, or progesterone, usually only works short term to regulate your cycle. You may need to take it on and off throughout the rest of your child bearing years.\\n\\nI know you said you were a private person, but trust me, if you have PCOS you will get used to going to the GYN pretty quickly. I\\'m not saying it\\'s a joyful experience, but you do get used to it.\\n\\nThe reason she thought they might do the biopsy, is because of the heavy bleeding.  They may want to check for endometriosis.\\n\\nGood luck with everything and keep us posted.  cmpgirl\\nMy doc seemed to think that since there were 2 medium sized cysts or 1 9cm cyst that they would want it out. I am nervous and scared about any surgery. Do they normally grow like this? In August it was just one 2.2cm cyst.\\n\\nI am having a lot of pelvic/hip/low back pain that my pcp says is due probably to my cysts and compounded by my inflamed bowels. The constant period (which is worse now that I am off progesterone) is a problem too.\\n\\nI was originally told this was no big deal & they just watch it, but now they are talking about other treatments. I would love any input from anyone who may have had similar problems or a 9cm cyst.\\nHukleberrie:  If it helps at all, my sister-in-law had a cyst on her right ovary about a year ago that her doctor said was almost the size of a soda can.  They scheduled surgery, they removed the entire ovary and she has not had any recurrances on the remaining one to date.\\n\\nIn her case the cyst was so large they had to take the entire ovary, but for smaller (10, 11 or 12cm) cysts, they can sometimes just remove the cyst itself.\\n\\nHope this answers your questions a little better.  Also, about the rapid growth...yes, they can grow rapidly (or shrink) on their own.\\n\\nGood luck with everything and I hope it all turns out well for you.  cmpgirl\\nWell, I went to the ER due to pain, my doctor\\'s office said if the tylenol 3s did not help my pain, to go to ER if it was severe, and my husband said I needed to go, so I did. The ER doctor said the pain was NOT from the cyst and they seemed more concerned about the constant vaginal bleeding (for the last 6 weeks). He said the cyst would not cause pain for a long period of time & that it would only be in one area, not across the whole abdomen & into the hip. (Most of my pain is in the right hip, but the cyst is actually in the left. I do have some stabby pains in the left that I do believe is due to the cyst, but I guess the constant ache & burning is maybe due to my IBD? He also said maybe my uterus could be causing some of this pain.....)\\n\\nSo I was just wondering if someone could explain their cyst pain, if they have had cyst pain.... Maybe it will help me figure out what is going on with my pain...\\nWell, I just went to the gyno. He said the bleeding is possibly due to my cyst(s), he is scheduling surgery. Hysterscopy D&C, and diagnostic laproscopy, he hopes he can do remove the cyst laproscopically, but may have to do a laparotomy (open surgery) due to the size. I guess it\\'s very large (or it was a month ago- who knows how big it is now! He did do a pelvic & felt it both masses, which was very uncomfortable). I did also get the ultrasound report. It\\'s a septated cyst, either two cysts over 5 cm each or one over 10 cm. He said it\\'s a complex cyst & we need to make sure it\\'s not cancer. He also said my uterus is very large & that I have a mass on the right side. (I should have asked more about that, I guess. It took me by surprise. Maybe I misunderstood what he said.) My thyroid was enlarged, I guess. But I have been tested twice for that & it came back normal both times, so I am sure that means nothing.\\n\\nAnyway, I am waiting to hear when my surgery is scheduled. Because I don\\'t have insurance, I have to apply for financial assistance for my medicaid spend down & once they have that finalized, then they will make the appt. So there is more waiting, as always.\\n\\nHad the laprascopic surgery. The cyst was gone! All this for nothing! The lump on the right must be due to the IBD. Pain must be due to the IBD. Now I have this surgery pain to boot!!\\nYour doctor could be wrong about the pain....\\nNot only do i have cyst\\'s but i am one of what the ER doctor told me is 1 in 1000 women that had a cyst explode. i will try to explain the lower abdomen pain the best i can. It seemed to be intense in one area but spread throughout the lower abdomen and when they do that push on your belly and let go quickly test, it is unbearable. The pain in the lower abdomen was due to the area being completely full of blood. Apparently a large cyst that i had on my right ovary had become so big it developed a blood vessel which attached to it.  During intercourse nearly 4 days before i was rushed to the ER, i felt a pop and for 4 days following that the broken vessel kept bleeding internally into my lower abdomen. The technical term is \"hemoragic ovarian cyst\" They can detect this condition with a normal ultrasound.  DO NOT LEAVE IT LONG. At the point where your abdomen will be so full of blood it will hurt to walk, sit, breathe, bowel movements, and all the morphine in the world won\\'t make it go away\\nBest of luck and i wish it apon no one.\\nI had surgery & the cyst was already gone. No cyst to cause the pain. Went to an osteopath doc who said it\\'s my hip flexors. Makes sense with my pain.\\ni have had polyps on my uterus which were removed with a hysteroscopy.  it has caused me to bleed almost regularly as well. after about 3 weeks or so of bleeding it did get very dark like mentioned earlier.  i actually have a large mass now and i\\'m scheduled to have another hysteroscopy in a couple weeks. fun can\\'t wait!\\n\\ni just wanted to comment on the ruptured cyst thing.  i have pcos and i\\'m used to having stabbing pains now and again.  But about a year ago it was insane!  i actually started vomiting.  the pain moved around so the dr at the urgent care was very confused.  they sent me over to the hospital to get an ultrasound.  well, after an ultrasound and a ct scan they still weren\\'t sure.  my right ovary was very \"swollen\".  what they told me is that i probably had ruptured a cyst.  now i don\\'t know if this is correct but they told me that it can enter your blood stream like some kind of poison and that\\'s what was making me throw up.  does that make any sense at all?!\\nJamie: Yes, it\\'s called septicemia. It happens when infection enters the blood stream. It can be very dangerous, actually lethal, if not taken care of immediately. I would think if you were septic, they would have put you on IV antibiotics immediately and admitted you to the hospital. As far as I know they don\\'t send septic patients home with oral anti-biotics. I\\'m more inclined to think the pain itself was making you vomit.',\n",

I had high risk pregnancies.   My first I lost at around 12-14 weeks. I did not know I was even pregnant until I lost the baby at home. That was a major shock. My second was a tubal. My third is my now 14 year old son. I carried him real low and had alot of contractions with him. Towards the end of pregnancy I was not aloud to move around.  My fourth I lost at about 6 weeks. The fifth is my now 8 year old daughter. She was the worst pregnancy of them all. I had to quit work because of pre-term labor. At 33 weeks I ended up in the hospital because the contraction were not stopping. Finally we got them to stop and was sent home on complete bed rest. That whole pregnancy from start to finish was hard on me. With both my kids pregnancy I had to take progesterone suppositories. I hope this helped a little. If you have any questions please ask.\\n\\nElaine\\nThank you for sharing your experiances, i\\'m  sorry that you had so many difficult ones, i and my husband are \"kinda\" ttc and i do have PCOS but take metformin regularly. i get my periods reg. i should get one soon (its late so i am kinda excited and hoping i\\'m pregnant) you mentioned taking some things during the last preg, where you being treated for PCOS also during the miscarriages? and did the doictors blame it on PCOS or on something else?\\nI was  diagnosed with PCOS before I tried to get pregnant. The progesterone supp. I took was to help hold the pregnancy. I was lacking the progesterone to substain a pregnancy. Even though I took them, there still was a possibilty of loosing the baby. I was at higher risk of pregnancy loss due to my progesterone being so low. I hope this helped.\\nSame for me.  I was diagnosed with PCOS and sought infertility treatment.  I took 3 forms of progesterone to help \"hold\" and nourish the pregnancies, however I was not considered high risk.  I eventually had two children and no complications despite my pcos.  Good luck!!\\n\\nMichelle\\nhow would i know if i have progesterone problems, is that somethign that you only know after you get pregnant? and i get my period reg on metformin could i still be infertile?\\nSheila,\\n\\nI had a blood test that showed I had low progesterone. I am now 43 years old and I am still low on progesterone. I was told even though you get your period you still may not be ovulating. I know that was my issue.

I never had good results and still had the darn period.\\nThank you for all your help ( both of you ) i think i better go back to the GYN get some more tests done. thanks for all your help.\\nHi!

       " {'post': \"I am almost 30 and was diagnosed with PCOS about two years ago.  I am tall and slender and do not have diabetes, which threw my doctors off for a while (I have been to OBGYNs, two Endocronologists, and even a dermatologist) but finally they diagnosed me.  I have always had irregular periods but was on the pill for years.  It was only when I stopped taking the pill that the problems started.  My hair is falling out and I didn't have periods (I've always had hair in places it shouldn't be but have learned ways to deal with that).  Recently I was put on Metforman in the hopes of getting pregnant.  I've been on the medication for about six months and for the past three I've had regular periods, almost like clock work.  It's been two weeks since my last period and I started having abdominal pain and discharge.  The abdominal pain is going on twenty four hours and is dull but persistant and the discharge is clear and stringy.  I've never had this before and a friend told me this must be the first time I have ever ovulated in my life.  I don't know if I believe this or not and am worried something else could be going wrong.  I am married and monogomous, but still... I am worried.  I mean, it could be anything I guess.  Has anyone experienced this before?\\nSounds like something you should mention to your doctor. There are some possibilities I can guess on. But I'm not doctor. lol\\n\\nFirst, is your pain localized to the lower side/sides of your abdomin? It could be ovulation, depending on where the pain is. For me, I generally feel some pain during ovulation most months. Not all women have that, but some do. The ovaries are very low in the abdomin, just above the pelvis on the far right and left.\\n\\nSecond, the discharge may indeed be evidence of ovulation, but the fact that it's stringy could actually indicate a yeast infection. If you start to feel itching or soreness around the area, chances are, that's what it is. Again though, check it out with your doctor to be sure.\\n\\nAin't it fun bein a gurl?\\n\\nYes, you can  getpainful  ovulation itcould be mild to severe.  Itcould be cysts on the ovaries.  I  used to get SEVERE pain so bad my stomache would swell and I couldn't even  walk at times.  I was told by my OB that it was a ovulation pain, (but then found out years later It was cysts).  Massive ones and clusters of cysts.\\nAs far as discharge, I started  that when  I  was about 10years old.\\nI would deffinately let the doc know about this.  You should go for a transvaginal to see if  it is cysts.\\nI know what you are dealing with..\\nIt  aint fun.\\nFor the last 25 years I have suffered painful ovulation, the pain usually is in my right side but sometimes on the left. There is also a watery discharge sometimes spotting and a generally feeling of bloating in my lower stomach. I have had many tests and examinations and the doctor has ruled out cysts,etc., but did mention ovulation since it occurrs around the same time each month. I believe alot of women suffer from this and it can be very painful, however it is rarely reported on. Over the last few months I have found Black Cohosh which has helped so much with the pain and I was wondering if anyone else had experienced the same thing??\\n\",\n",

       " {'post': \"How exactly did you go about it? I'm lowcarbing and can't seem to lose any!\\n\\nTIA!\\nI just want to say you're not alone!  I never lost any weight on it either.  I was taking 1700mg/day and maybe wasn't as hungry at times, but didn't lose more than a few pounds.  My dr got my hopes up saying I'd see a huge weight loss...no such luck!\\nThe only weight I ever lost after being diagnosed was when my husband and I started walking 5 miles a night.  We live in a medium size city and quite near the downtown area, so we sould walk through the city and around the nearby neighborhoods.  It wasn't really even what I would call a power walk. We went a little faster than normal gait, but not bad.\\n\\nI ended up losing 20lbs. over the summer that year.  My GYN told me it was probably because the added exercise helped speed up my metabolism. PCOS tends to slow the metabolism, quite a bit.\\n\\nI don't know if this will help, but just thought I'd let you know that it worked for me.  Best of luck!\\nI've been officially diagnosed with PCOS for 2 years now, although I'm sure I've had it for over 10 years.  I've been doing South Beach and just can't lose any weight.  My doctor finally did a 3-hour glucose tolerance test, and my numbers were really out of whack.  I may very well be diabetic now.  I have to wait and see the endocrinologist to plan my course of action.  You may want to speak with your doctor about doing that test.\\nI joined a gym and lost 2 pounds in one year. Then in January I started doing my own program (run 30 min and weights/aerobics for 30 min, twice a day - 2 hours total). I lost about 10 pounds by Feb. Started taking Metformin in late Feb and I have lost a total of 30 pounds to date. The weight loss has certainly slowed, but so has my motivation. For us with PCOS we have to do twice as much work to see half the results. Also, cut out carbs (fruit and yogurt have a bunch of them). That was vital for me too.\\n\\nStarting slow and adding more time/intensity as you go along helps. But perhaps the best thing that has worked for me is the buddy system. I knew that my friend would be so mad to wake up at 5:30 to work out if I did not show up. Think POSITIVE peer pressure!\\nHello!  I am new to this message board and wanted to share my story.  I have PCOS and me and hubby tried for 11 years to get pregnant.  I have always been over weight and lucky to get my monthly once a year if that.  I have tried every diet and excercise plan to lose the weight.  About a year ago some friends of mine was going to the bariatric clinic to lose weight and it was just falling off.  So I decided to give it a try, and it WORKED!!  In a year I had lost 85 lbs. and didn't even really have to try to lose weight!  Easiest thing I have ever done and I feel great!  I did join a gym too, but would only go about once a week.  My Dr told me that if I would just lose 30 lbs. I would start having my periods regular and if I lost even more I would get pregnant.  He said that was my only hope for getting pregnant with PCOS.  At exactly a 30 lb. loss I started having regular cycles every single month on time and ovulating which I hadn't done in 11 years on my own.  And 3/7/08 took 3 hpt and they were all positive.  We was so excited, to have finally done it naturally by just losing weight.  On 4/24/08 I went in for my 12 week ultrasound and was told I was pregnant with twins....but one didn't develope and the other had no heartbeat.  4/25/08  I had to have a d & C, go back to Dr. in 2 weeks for follow-up visit.  Dr. said the miscarriage had nothing to do with the PCOS, and nothing we could have done to prevent that from happening.  The chromosomes were just not in line with what they needed to be.  He said we could start trying again in 3 months.  But I just wanted everyone to know it is possible and there is HOPE!  I have never felt this good as to when I lost all the weight and became pregnant on my own!\\nhi guys i to suffer with pcos for the pass 9 years i had a opration 3years ago they removed cycts luckly i found out that i was indeed pregnant my little boy he is going to be 2 this year dont give up girls keep praying to god it to will happen to you iam big too cant seem to remove the weight been tryin to lose weight need heip any tips /ideas\\n\",\n",

       " {'post': \"Hello...\\nCan anyone please tell me, can a woman with PCOS get pregnant ? I yes,  then what percentage of women having PCOS can get pregnant, have a normal delivery and give birth to a normal child?\\nAlso, if a woman having PCOS starts having irregular menses, and if she starts taking the pill and continues doing so for 6 months, can she hope to regulate her menses?\\nPLEASE RESPOND.\\nA great worrier.\\n\\nNam,\\n\\nI myself have PCOS and can tell you that with the proper treatments that we have a greater chance in getting pregnant than a healthy women. A healthy woman only has a 20% chance of getting pregnant every month. With all the intervention that we have our chances increase. Yes it is harder, but we will all appreciate the end results much more. As far as your cycle, the pill will always make you regular no matter what, it is supplimenting the hormones that your body is not naturally producing. But if you are on the pill to jump start your body for other procedures then it can be affective. I am not a Doctor but ask your RE all these same questions and see what they say. Hope I was some sort of help.\\n\\nS\\nHi!\\n\\nI was diagnosed with PCOS when I was about 20.  At that point, I got my period about once every 2-3 months.  By the time I turned 22, I stopped getting my period all together.  I had been on the pill since then to deal with some of the medical issues with PCOS and to have a cycle.\\n\\nKnowing that I didn't ovulate at all, I started by going to see an infertility doctor.  They had to try a number of meds just to get me to ovulate.  The combo that worked was 200 mg of Clomid and a med called Avandia that deals with some of the insulin problems that you can have with PCOS.  The combination got my system to ovulate.  I have three unsuccessful IUIs (inseminations) before I started having some side effects from the Clomid.\\n\\nI'm currently getting ready to start with the next step -- which is daily injections from day 3 to about day 15 of my cycle.  I'll be on the follistim med.  That will also make me ovulate.\\n\\nThe main problem with PCOS is that the hormone levels are off and your body doesn't always (if ever) cycle on its own.  I would HIGHLY recommend going to an infertility/reproductive endo specialist right away.  If nothing else, they teach you how to monitor your cycles and how to time you attempts.  They will also determine if you need meds to keep a cycle.   Hope this helps.\\nHello Namrata:\\n\\nIf you are trying to conceive but have irregular menses, your doctor can prescribe a medication called Provera.  This is progesterone (which your body needs, especially to have menses).  Once you take it for 10 days, your menses should appear.  Whether or not you ovulate regularly is a different story.\\nI have conceived 2 pregnancies on my own and miscarried one.  I have a very healthy 2 1/2 yr old boy and was recently diagnosed with pcos when I sought treatment for secondary infertility.\\n\\nI have to suppose I always had it and that it did not suddenly appear after my son was born, but I am lucky that I do not have insulin resistance, although I did get gestational diabetes while pregnant.  They may also attribute my miscarriage to pcos.\\n\\nI have a good friend who had not ovulated on her own for over a decade.  She conceived her first child thru IVF and then miraculously conceived her second with no intervention.  My sister has a friend who has had 3 children thru IVF, she also has pcos.\\n\\nThere is most definitely hope for you!  You'll be in my thoughts...good luck!\\n\\ni was diagnosed with PCOS @ 18 and told I would never have children.  I now have 4 (am 37); with the help of clomid, injections, and alot of prayers.  good luck to you.  my periods however were never regular and 3x a year was alot for me.\\ni also have PCOS, it has made my life very difficult over the last few years,  but i am dealing.\\n\\nmy hubby and i have been trying for a  year and still nothing\\n\\nany advive is greatly needed\\nYes, you can get pregnant with PCOS, because I just did!!!\\n\\nI highly recommend:\\nHealing Syndrome O: A Strategic Guide to Fertility, Polycystic Ovaries, and Insulin Imbalance\\nBy Dr. Ronald F. Feinberg, M.D. Ph.D\\n\\n\\n\\nI agree with the last thread! Just by a whim I decided to by the book. I couldn't stop reading it! You will never ever! get a better explaination of PCOS from top to bottom. I have PCOS. Have been trying for 9 years. Although only the last year through treatments!\\nI am resistant to chlomid, to metformin(alone any way, but the met is working because other symptoms are disappearing) and to gonal F and follistim, (which are the same thing) I barely responded to the injections so my Dr. recomemded ovarian drilling. I had it done on the 8th, a week ago! Pretty painful recovery, but I have a low tolerance to pain!\\nI got pictures today of my uterus, tubes and ovaries. OMG my ovaries are huge! I wish I could post my pictures some how and show you the result. My Dr. said they resemble those of a severly obese woman, however I am only slightly over weight.  I have pictures after they put holes in my ovaries. It's not appealing. There is one picture of the same thing in that book. I got it cheap, like 12 bucks. I still go back through it and find something to highlight and ask my Dr. on my visits.  Hopefully you respond to meds. without having to go so far as surgery though!  Now I am on birth control pills until I start (AF) and then I will start a cycle of follistim again. Supposadly I should respond a great deal to the injections now. I am so excited! I can hardly wait to start! Who ever says that\\nGood luck to all of you and stop asking questions\\nBuy the book for real. It's the best motivation and education I have found for our syndrome!!!! Trust me I have been searching!!\\nbaby dust to all!!!\\n\\nMy name is Gemma i am 18 years old and i was told that i have PCO just before Christmas 2003. I dont know how serious i have it but my worst fear is not being able to get pregnant in the furture. i need somebody to talk to who is going through the same situation. nobody knows how i feel apartment from the people who are also going through it.\\nThe good news is that PCOS is treatable and according to my doctor, it is completely possible to get pregnant with this diagnosis.  The timeline may vary from person to person, and responses to treatments may vary, but this is not a diagnosis that means you can't have children.  Stay positive, do your research, and take care of yourself.  Also, realize that you may need to try longer than most people to get pregnant, and therefore, if it is something you really want, you may want to take that into consideration as you date and move forward in your life.  But you are really young and should not feel like you need to ruch into this tomorrow! Be responsible, but live with the knowledge that you may need intervention to conceive and that it could take time for you.\\nBest of luck to you!\\nI was diagnosed with PCOS about 9 months ago.  I just started up on metformin for a second try.  The first time it made me way to sick to continue use. This second time around I am having much better luck with it. I have a 3 month supply of the medication.  I was wondering if anyone has been on this and has had success?  I am an obesse person.  I have been considered for diabetes several times only to find I was not diabetic.  I have been reading that with weight loss and taking the medication that I should be better able to conceive or at least have AF visit again.  With the cramps and pain I'm experiencing I would love for AF to come and stay a very long time.  The way my doctor explained it to me is that I have multiple cyst forming around the openings of my ovaries and the medication should help clear them up and from then on I should function normally.  Anyone have any info about this? Preferrably something wrote in english.\\nHi, I'll say sorry in advance i'm likely to ramble on a bit here lol\\n\\nI was diagnosed with PCOS when i was about 16(ish) My otherhalf and myself decided we wanted to start a family early but as i only had about 3 or so periods a year i ended up on clomid, I stayed on that for a few years but mostly i think the doctor decided that as i was so young maybe id change my mind or wasnt so serious about getting pg. By the time i was put onto injections i wasnt having any periods at all and it took another 10 months before i finnaly concieved my lickle boy,7 years in total, He's 6 now and we would both dearly love another baby, I also have been diagnosed with Insulin resistance and depression, But as metaformin doesnt suit me and im overweight the doctors dont seem interested in helping me, Unfortunatly ive been having some symptoms of early menapause (flushing, No periods for 2 years,Hirtuismn(sp) getting worse) Sadly i feel my time has ran out on me, But dont give up hope of getting pg, I did in a time i thought i never would.... Looking back at all the bad things that happened during and after my pregnancy ie preclampsia,traumatic forceps delivery and him having dyspraxia & behavioural problems he may not be perfect but i wouldnt change him for the world, I have to agree it makes you appreciate your lickle one more!\\n\\nMandi xx\\n\\n\\nhi everyone need some help, finding it hard to deal with all what is going on. the thought of not being able to have kids kills me. me and my fiancee want them so much. and im scared he wont be satisfied with just us.\",\n",

I\\'ve always had absent periods, and totally forgot I was diagnosed with this back when I was a teenager.  What are the consequences if one doesn\\'t get it checked out or fixed?  Can it push you into an early menopause (I only say that because of the lack of menstrual cycles).\\nChances are you will find some one here with polycystic ovaries as this is the PCOS forum!\\nI take it your new here and that your just learning the facts of PCOS. My advise to you is to have a good read through other peoples posts and you will probabully find out loads of stuff that you have never been sure of... Thats what I did, I hope you find what your looking for.\\nGood Luck\\nPCOS is also NOT a disease, its a condition, The word \\'disease\\' could offend people here, As this condition is quite a sensitive issue that brings with it lots and lots of heart ache before eventually getting your bundle of joy...\\n\\nI didn\\'t even notice this forum.  I am somewhat new, just haven\\'t been here in a long time.\\nI was diagnosed with it back when I was a teen.  I went to a doctor Monday (cost me enough) and she actually called it that. Thinking about it, it does sound a bit offensive.\\nOh, just thought I\\'d add in the symptoms I have, that I just recently looked up...\\n\\nLack of menstruation cycles:  I always thought it was amenorrhea and made up another topic about it here a good while back.  But either way, I\\'ve gone years without having periods at a time, but, every time I was on something like estrogen pills, I\\'d flow a very very very long time.  One time, I was on for months nonstop.  I\\'m surprised I didn\\'t become anemic because of it.  After I stopped the medication, the periods stopped, again, and, once again, years go by.  Unless I take some type of medication, I don\\'t get them.\\n\\nDyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse):  I think I might have this.  My boyfriend and I tried once, and he wasn\\'t even close to entering, just a little, and it hurt terribly and I told him to stop.\\n\\nPelvic Pain:  I get this so much and so often, it\\'s become routine.  I\\'ve just come to accept it.\\n\\nFacial Hair:  I always have to pluck the hair that grow on my face.  I\\'ve had this problem since I was a teenager.\\n\\nI also feel that I\\'ll probably be infertile due to how long I\\'ve gone with out having a normal menstrual cycle starting from when I first started as a kid.  How does one determine if she\\'s infertile or not?\\n\\nAs for the risk factors associated with it, I have had weight gain, but that was from a young age, I now have Type II Diabetes, and now have an elevated cholesterol and still overweight (seems my body holds on to it).\\nWhat a naughty doctor you have, There are thousands of sites on the net that relate to PCOS and not one of them call this a disease, If you see the doctor again prehaps you could educate her/him. After spending some time in this forum you will definatly be in the know... If your doctor isnt living with PCOS then she/he will be working by stistics and not actual facts... specialist are the ones to take notice of  ( I am not one by the way) ha ha  x\\nActually, I don\\'t have a primary physician or a GYN anymore.  I haven\\'t had health insurance for years and have never had a job that offered it, so I could never really afford to go to one.  This is just some lady that a clinic recommended to me.  I personally didn\\'t like her much, but I had to do something for my diabetes.  I haven\\'t had any medication for it in over a year because I couldn\\'t afford to go to get a refill.  That visit I did on Monday cost me $370 and because of that, I had to bum the money off my parents, especially since I\\'m not working (still haven\\'t found a job).\\n\\nEither way, those types of doctors don\\'t seem all that \"concerned\" with the patient, and I\\'m even more convinced of the \"rejection of insulin\" thing.  They gave me an insulin shot (I take pills).  Some fast-acting insulin thing just to bring it down some (it was 315 before the shot).  My blood sugar level when checking it later was incredibly high with it (358).  It was rather scary.  I\\'d never seen it that high before, and I hadn\\'t had any carbs or anything.  I hadn\\'t even had anything to eat, and it shot up, so maybe the PCOS is getting worse.\\nI talked to my gyno about what to do with the PCOS, if I wasn\\'t trying to conceive.  He informed me that I would be best to continue with metformin, helps with the weight gain, and also he would give me a perscription for a pill that would cause a period to come on in a matter of a couple of weeks.  He told me that if women go for more than 3 months without cycling, the tissue in our uterus will get old and rotten and could lead to many more severe health problems such as ovarian cancer and the like.  I can\\'t say for sure if this is completely true but makes a lot of sense to me.  I think the pill was progesterone and you take it for 10 days and within a week there after you should start a cycle.\\n\\nHis gross analogy he compared it to is like a toilet, if you don\\'t flush it down you could have harmful bacteria growing.  Sorry if that was TMI!\\n\\nBest of luck!\\n\\n\\nProgesterone...you know, I think that\\'s the medication that I used to be on years ago.  The only problem is that after doing the 10 day thing with that, I wouldn\\'t stop flowing.  Imagine how annoying that is...having your cycle going for months at a time.  One year, it started in like June (after I\\'d taken the medicine) and didn\\'t end until like December, and I was heavy the entire time and had to double up.

I haven\\'t had a period in 7 months and before that 12 months. Im despret and would like to get pregnant.\\nSo weird, I was just telling my GYN\\'s nurse today I eat ground flax daily.\\n\\nI am not trying to conceive (I\\'m in my 40\\'s) but I went in to see the Dr. end of Aug because I had missed two or three periods. I also was experiencing hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms. I thought I was perimenopasual. Hormone tests and an ultrasound showed cysts and PCOS. She wanted to put me on birth control pills to regulate my periods. I prefer not to go on BC because I\\'ve never been on them and I\\'m a former smoker.\\n\\nI\\'ve always had period issues but never was diagnosed with anything. Pain, extremely heavy periods, big clots etc. Most of my issues were resolved when I started low carbing a couple years ago. My periods became lighter and I had much less pain. I attributed it all to low carbing. After visiting with the Dr. about my missed periods though I realized I had stopped eating my ground flax seed in the spring sometime.\\n\\nI made a \\'hot cereal\" of them  (2 tablespoons ground flax, 1/3 cup water - microwave for 1 min then add butter or cream or milk if you\\'re not low carbing), splenda, cinnamon, etc) and would have that every morning. It fit in with my Atkins and it was good fiber. I didn\\'t realize it was good for a natural estrogen too until I did some reading. Anyway, long story short after my checkup in Aug. I went back on my flax cereal. Within a month I had me period and it\\'s been regular ever since. It comes either the 22nd or 23rd of each month.\\n\\nNow, I don\\'t know if it\\'s low carbing, the flax seeds or a combination of both but whatever I\\'m doing is really helping to regulate things. I\\'m inclined to think it\\'s the flax. You can easily do an internet search on PCOS and ground flax and do some research. I happened to have taken the flax before knowing I had PCOS but you can be sure come this summer I will not be giving it up again. And while flaxseed oil is very healthy in it\\'s own right, you\\'re not going to get the benefits you would from ground flax  (not whole either, the body can;t break it down to get the nutrients).\\n\\nGood luck if you decide to try it.\\nI just recently started taking Flaxseed oil capsules again (about 3 days now).  I had taken them a while back, but probably only a week.  Not long enough to see a difference.  The only reason I started taking them was b/c I heard they were great for heart health.  I didn\\'t know it will help my PCOS!  I hope this is true.  I\\'ll report later if I find any changes.  Are there any articles out there discussing the benefits of Flaxseed oil (or flax period) and PCOS?\\nKharma...after reading your post, I bought some ground flax that evening.  I\\'ve been taking it daily since then in combination with flaxseed oil, multivitamin and metformin.  I actually got a period with ovulation!  Like you, I do low carb...but I think the flax did the trick to get things going.  Thanks for the advice!\\n\\nI tried the cereal recipe, but it just got a gelatenous goo.  Since then I\\'ve mixed it with food.  One time I even mixed it in my coffee.  It\\'s much easier to incorporate into your diet than I thought.\\n\\nBottom line...thanks for the tip!',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hey yall,\\nI will be starting my first round of clomid in about a week.  I was wondering if anyone could tell me about the pill as far as any possible side effects.  Also for anyone who has had success with clomid, how many cycles of clomid did it take for you to become pregnant?\\nHi Dolphin\\n\\nI did clomid for 5 cycles, I got a positive pregnancy during my 4th cycle, it unfortunatley ended with a blighted ovum but nothing to do with clomid. I have stoped reacting to clomid so I am starting injectables at the end of this month.  The side effects are different for everyone, I suffered from hot flushes, nausea, weight gain (but it could also be from PCOS) and I was very emotional. I hope you have no side effects.\\n\\nGood luck with your cycle\\n\\nCharlene\\nThough not typical, I don\\'t recall any negative side effects.  I took, I think 11 rounds of clomid starting at 50mg and progressing to 150mg.  Finally a combo of dexamethazone, metformine, clomid, projesterone, and estrodol I got preggers and have a beautiful healthy baby girl.  She was born 6 weeks early weighed 4 lbs 14 oz and was 19\" long.  She stayed in the NICU for 6 days, to maintain body temp and then we came home and it has been CRAZY ever since.\\n\\nGood Luck! ! ! !\\n\\nI had been on clomid a few yrs ago and it really helped me ovulate, unfortunatly no pregnancy though. I too had hot flushes, got emotional and saw coloured dots. When my dosage was put up I started fainting which only happens very rarely!!!\\nA friend of mine is due to give birth any day now which is a result of clomid\\n\\nGOOD LUCK\\n\\nx\\nI\\'m on my third round of clomid, CD7 today so just took last pills. No pg first two cycles so I was upped from 50 to 100mg. Going for 13day follicle U/S on Jan 5. I\\'m trying to stay positive, and have lots of ppl praying for us. Anyways I have had pretty interesting side effects. I get kind of dizzy and nauseous. My husband says i get extra irratible. This third cycle i\\'ve had the \\'pleasure\\' of experiencing hot flashes. But it will all be worth it in the end. I know that I\\'m will ing to go thru much worse to have children.\\nI just finished my first round of clomid, and i really had a plesant experience. my husband said i was really moody but thats all good luck\\ni also was on clomid this cycle and the side effects i mostly noticed were hot flashes ( like crazy ) and mood swings ( this is according to my dh\\n). i will be testing somewhere between the 8th and the 10th. i should really wait until the 10th which is 2 weeks but its so hard to wait\\n',\n",

       " {'post': \"Ok, here's something that no one here has spoken about. I am trying alternative methods to TTC. I have PCOS and have been taking metf for about 2 1/2 yrs or so. I have TTC on this alone.  I have had no success.  The metf regulated my visits from AF.  but no pregnancy. So I went to Tecate & got a fertility massage and drank some herbal tea that tasted the worst.  I stopped taking metf about 2wks ago when I started the herbal treatment. I haven't had a complete cycle yet since then. AF is now 1 1/2 wks late.  Has anyone out there been on metf and stopped taking it?  If so how long did it take for your AF to stop visiting regularly?\\n\\ni'm really bad about taking mine. sometimes i do sometimes for a month i won't. i can always tell i don't have an af that month.\\nThanks for the reply.  But question did you ever stop like a week before AF was due and then missed it. I'm telling you I can't handle the wait thing it drives me crazy. Right now I'm crying and I think it's all the stress. I just want AF to come if I'm not so I can at least be relieved from this guessing.  I started back on the pills again. We will see I can't handle anymore disappointments and so I still haven't take a PT which it's too soon anyway. Does anyone know if metf can cause a miscarriage?\\n\\ni have stoped a week before af and didn't get it. but i never know when to expect it only time i was regular was when i was on bc pill. one time i took met. for three months not missing or quiting  i was regular when-in a couple of days. but got af on my own this month just late. so i started it again on day 1 of cycle.\\nhave you thought about moving on to clomid?\\nWell, again I am so grateful to you for your responses.  Last time I posted and go zero response.  Yes, I have thought about using clomid and did lots of research on it. But with the possible side effects I decided to try a couple of other things first. Getting the massages first w/o metf then with metf since AF never came I started back on the pills according to what I read if I am preg it wont hurt.  I just stopped drinking the herbal tea He gave me. How long after restarting metf did AF come?\\nWell, my story is not so short and sweet but i'll try. I had to self diagnose my PCOS. My doctors kept insisting that I stay on BC. I couldn't stand it because on BC my PMS was the worst and I was very moody. And how can I get preg on BC. Also, I attempted suicide during one of my really bad episodes of PMS and I knew I had to do something.  I knew it was my PMS because I started the following morning. When I told my doctor she wanted to put me on more meds.  I started researching irregular periods & periods that never end. The more I found out the more I was convince that I knew what was wrong with me.  I spoke to my doctor and she apparently had never heard of or never took it seriously.  I finally had to take her a HUGE folder full of research and she prescriped metf as per the papers I took her.  I felt so different on metf finally normal and my periods regulated. I am very careful about taking metf. I never wanted to go back on BC. It's really hard to get preg when you're constantly messing with your cycle.  Anyway about a 1 1/2 - 2yrs ago I started metf but still no preg. So now I'm trying alternative methods. I've been asking alot of people and have now found out 3 friends have done this and where successful and conceiving only 2 though Carried To Term. My friend that mc also suffers w/PCOS. I'm on my way to talk to her to try to get more info from her now. I have clomid set as my final attempt. I told myself that if I don't conceive by my 35th birthday that I would give up. I am now 34yrs old so I decided to go into this year fighting with everything I've got. there you go me in a nut shell.\\nhey every one i do have pcos and i have bee off of Glucophage for 4 years and i was on it for a year. and i dont know if i can get pregnant we have been tring to get pregnant for a while and i dont know if i can have kids. but i am having regular periods.and we took two pregnacy last month and well one show two line but the secon line was very light and when we took the second one the same thing happend after i took that test i got my period.i am really upset cause i think my husband is going to leave me if i can't get pregnanteven though he says we can always adopt but i know deep dpwn he wants his his onw what should i do?\\n\",\n",

       " {'post': \"I was having problem of premensturation spotting for the past two months. I consulted a gynecologist and Ultrasound she said that my ovaries are normal in size however have multi cysts. She prescribed me Diane 35. I don’t have any symptom of PCOS except premenstrual spotting. I have normal periods, never missed any. No acne, no weight gain, no extra hair (do have fine hair all over my body but not men like). For the second opinion, I consulted another gynecologists she said that I might be having problem of spotting due to frequent travel (which  I am doing for the past one year) and after ultrasound she saw no cysts in my ovaries, she says everything is normal and I shouldn’t use Diane 35. What should I do? I am worried what if the first gynecologist is right and the second one can’t see the cysts in ovaries. I am planning to have a baby soon, the first baby. I am worried. Please suggest how to confirm that I don’t have cysts in ovaries and I am not PCOS. Thanks\\nhello,\\n\\nwe get cysts on our ovaries every month naturally, from what i've been told but do your own research for sure!  the difference in people with pcos is that they never go away, then you stop ovulating properly and loose the periods all together.  in the meantime, getting all the lovely side effects of pms but only you NEVER get the relief of having a period!  i'm not a doctor or anything, but sounds like you are doing alot in your life which will definately effect your bodies natural processes.  i bet if your life slowed down, then your body would go back to it's usual self.  also, if you are not getting results from your doctors, keep shopping for one then!  i went through about 6 before i found the one that would listen to me and then act on what my symptoms were.  maybe you should keep a log of your spotting and what not, it can only help the doc in the end.\\n\\ngood luck.  i will be hoping you dont have this very frustrating and complicated syndrome!\\n\\na.\\nseema, it is true that tiny cysts on the ovaries appear each month, but some months may not be as severe as others...it also depends on what day of your cycle that you are on, since most of those cysts are really follicles, and somtimes are extremely small and hard to see.\\n\\nI think Amy is right that you have to keep looking for the right doctor who will be able to make a decision on whether or not you do have PCOS and who will help you TTC.\\n\\nAnd so you know, not all PCOS women have severe forms of hirutism (hair growth).  Some women have a few stray hairs and more like fine hair in the rest of the places.  Also, everyone's bodies react to PCOS differently, so one person may have a mild case and another may have a severe case and have totally different symptoms.\\n\\nGood luck to you and hang in there!\\n\\nThank you both for your support. My second gynacologist did a couple more ultrasounds to see if everything is normal including ovulation. She has come up with normal report she says that everything is normal, the follicle is ruptured on time. But I am scared she has given me progestrone support to deal with premenstural spotting for the last 10 days of my cycle. She says no need for Diane 35. In my ultrasound there was just one dominant follicle which ruptured on time. What to do? Should I just forget about firt doctor's opinion? you guys are right, my life has been very busy latley with frequent travel (every 3 months) between Europe and Asia. Do you guys know about any online diagnosis where I can upload my ultrasound scan to get another opinion?\\n\\nThanks\\nI would go with what the second doctor says.  If you end up having trouble TTC then seek more help from yours or another doctor,  and seriously consider slowing your life down.  Remove the things of stress...you don't realize how much it affects your body.\\n\\nGood luck to you!\",\n",

For the last few weeks on and off I have had left ovary pain with referred pain in my left breast and sometimes shooting down my arm to my wrist.  This is strange as I have never had the referred pain before just the ovary pains!  Anyone else gets this??\\n\\nRight my question is, I have had left ovary pain for the last week and a couple of shooting pains in my right ovary too, I decided to buy myself the clearblue digital ovulation testing kit.  Yesterday I did the test and it said positive.  I phoned the help line and the lady didn't quite answer my question. My question was do you get a positive result after your most fertile days? say for the rest of the month until your period, or does it only say positive on the days you can actually conceive?.  Her answer to me was that because I have pcos I shouldn't use the test as it will give a false result.  If I have got a positive result on metformin with this ovulation test and negative results on other days, it must be picking up some sort of LH surge?  Maybe not enough to kick out an egg, but enough to bring on a period!\\n\\nHas anyone else used these test with pcos and metformin?  Or just pcos?\\n\\nThanks ladies\\n\\nI used ovulation kits with pcos and I was constantly getting conflicting results.  I would randomly get positive and negative results - it took me three months of using the tests to realize that they were not consistent with how the test results should be.  I ended up seeking treatment with a fertility doctor and he told me I could not count on the ovulation kits because of the pcos.\\n\\nWish you the best while trying!!!\\n\\nThanks very much for your reply.\\na few days after the couple of positive results it turned negative so that answers my question. Still no period yet.  Will do a preg test soon to see soon as my body temp is up in the morning, as it would be after a ovulation. I will leave it a week though as I'm fed up with spending money on these tests.\",\n",

       " {'post': \"i've been diagnosed with PCOS since i was 16. my first period wasnt until i was 16,i am now 18; and it was induced by my dr. she had given me a pill to take i believ it was provera (somthin like that) and once i started my period on that i had to take bc continuesly. my dr has changed my bc numerous time since than and if i dont take bc i dont have my period at all. i stopped taking my recent bc which was yasmin about 4 months ago and i havnt had a period since. i have 2 questions...\\n\\n1st question:: can you still become pregnant if you dont have a period?\\n\\n2nd question:: in january of 2007 my dr had found abnormal cells on my cervix and i had 2 have like a biopsy done on it. theres a specific name but i cant remember it. the results ame back that the cells were dormant but they never told me what kind of cells they were. i had 2 do a papsmere 4 months later and then 6 months later. my last papsmere was in december and my dr ha called me and 2 tell me she found more abnormal cells on my cervix and i have to go january 3rd,2008 for another biopsy thing. has anyone else had these abnormal cells with PCOS or is it somthing i should be very worried about? well im already worried.... im terrified. im getting married in 3 wks and i dont even know if i'll be able to give my fiancee children. or if these cells could be somthing terrible. could it be cervical cancer? does anyone know the symptoms of cervical cancer? please someone help me with these questions. i've never been quite sure what PCOS is or what its about. my dr hasnt really gone over it and it really scares me. thank you everyone.\\nYears back I had multiple bad paps which resulted in precancerous cells or cervical dysplasia.  It's not as scarey as it sounds - it is abnormal cells and I had a simple outpatient procedure in which they removed the cells and have never had a problem since.  Some women don't even need to have the procedure - it all depends on what level you have.  This was probably back 16 years ago.  Don't panic that it's cervical cancer because there are many in betweens that it could be, but definitely follow up with it to be sure and to have it monitored and taken care of so it doesn't turn into something to worry about.\\n\\nAs for the irregular periods - I never had regular periods either.  I stayed on birth control for years which regulated my periods which is important to keep your cervical lining strong and healthy (especially if you think you may want to have children).  I don't want to tell you that you can't get pregnant if you aren't getting a period because you just never know, but I can tell you it is possible to have children with pcos and with irregular periods.  When my husband and I were ready to try to get pregnant, I saw a fertility specialist because of the pcos and irregular periods and I just had to go two months worth of taking hormones to regulate myself and then was pregnant and now have a very healthy baby girl.\\n\\nI didn't receive a lot of information when I was younger about pcos from my doctors so I was never aware of what I needed to do or why I was having irregular periods.  Check with your doctor, but they will probably strongly recommend either staying on birth control until you are ready to try to have a baby or to have you take something like Provera every few months to force a period and keep your lining strong and healthy.\\n\\nBest of luck...and congratulations on your wedding!\\n\\nI dont know the answer to #2, but for #1,yes you can become pregnant without having a period.  You ovulate roughly 2 weeks BEFORE your period comes - i know ovulation is a random act with PCOS, but i did get pregnant that way!\\ni had abnormal paps for years and knew somthing was wrong, i had to have a cone biopsey for stage 2 cancer of the cervix, it was easaly removed, but its best to keep on top of it\",\n",

       " {'post': \"I've been going for tests the last couple of days now to see if I have Polycystic Ovaries. Does anyone have it and is there something that helped you get pregnant or are you still trying?\\nThanks!\\nHi Airees,\\nI am now 32 but when I was diagnosed with pcos i was 28 I think. I had a golfball sized cyst on my left ovary diagnosed by pain then u/s. I went on birth control and it went away. Then I got pregnant with my son and had him in 2001 but he was too early and did not survive. Then in 2003 I had my dd and she just turned 2. Since being diagnosed with pcos I have been doing many different things trying to keep ahead of the things that go wrong with me. With both pregnancies I had been taking a product from Sunrider called Beauty Pearls. Before my son I had been low carb for awhile. Now I have discovered I am hypothyroid so now I am taking Armour. I have been ttc for a year now but for the past 6 months I have been anovulatory. I have been seeing a naturopathic physician and now my cycles are starting to normal out. Before one period would last 2 weeks where the next 2 days and cycles could go on for months. So my advice to you is see a very good gyno get a bunch of blood tests and review your results. See what is off and go about fixing it. I believe that with mother nature she wants to be healthy when having babies so when something is wrong the first to go is the reproductive system. There is no quick cure when it comes to having things wrong with the human body. You have to be patient. If you want your body to heal on its own you have to give it the proper food. Whole grains,organic veggies slightly cooked and just a little organic meat. Go on colloidal silver in case you have a lingering virus. Just remember time. I have been healling for 4 months and just seeing results. Sorry if I am preaching but I hope this helps.  Love Brandy\\nI just came back from the doctor and have PCOS\\nI feel like crying right now. They're running a bunch of blood work on me and we'll see what happens I guess.\\nI am sorry . I feel for you and all I can say keep your chin up. You have no idea what wonderful things that are still in store for you. I have had 2 beautiful children with pcos and no doctors that would help me. All I have had is the will and a few herbs , not much of an arsonal I know but keeping postiive and stress free helps make you healthier.\\nBrandy\\nSo they didn't put you on anything? Does this mean that my eggs never fall? Does this mean I can still get pregnant now? I'm so confused or do I have to be put on medication to become pregnant?\\nNo they did not give me any meds other than b/c when I was first diagnosed. Iwas on it for 3 months. then a few months later I was prego. I have been thinking of going on clomid for a few months. But I have to wait till dh is done with this job and he is home more often for bd. But sweety you have to remember everyone is different. What I may not have needed you may need. You need to investigate pcos on the net and books so you understand what your body is doing. But remember pcos is new for docs. They just started recognizing it as a desease. You need to have blood tests for hormones so you know what is going on. Once you have your info only then can you sit back and figure out what you need to do. There is a whole big world out there full of different kinds of ways to heal. Keep an open mind and you might want to try to pray about it and see if you get an answer. I may not be giving you anything really tangable to help you but remember I don't know you.\\nas far as pcos goes you may be insulin resistant. Have too much testosteron. too much estrogen. or some meds may have caused it.\\nThis is why I suggested a proper diet. Lowering your carb intake. Decreasing the amount of estrogen messing up foods such as non organic and possibly wheat.\\nIf you really want your mind blown look up a macrobiotic diet. You can try all the meds in the world but if you are consuming unwholsome foods your body will be unwholesome. We are the mirror image of our enviroment.\\nI have a question about eggs dropping...what exactly happens when you have Polycystic ovaries? Because you have this does it mean that eggs don't ever fall...or do they fall sometimes and you can get pregnant with those eggs that fall? I'm just learning about this, sorry for all the questions.\\nI went to the doctors for pains on my left side and left side of my belly button. I am going for a ultrasound tomorrow to see if it is ovarian cyst. I was given an anti-inflammatory pill..to take twice a day for two weeks, and can be taken as needed with the 2 refills. its called diclofenac sod dr t 75 MG. My doctor said that the cyst can go away on their own, but it takes a long time, and can be painful so there is medication to assist with them going away faster, my grandma said she had a cyst so painful that she had to get it removed.\\n\\nI guess i'll find out tomorrow..I havent had my period in two months either, but could be due also to getting off birth control pills.\\nI got pregnant twice and I have PCOS.  The first time we had to go on a combination of pergonal, dexamethasone and clomid (clomid alone didn't work for me, but did work fine for another friend who also had PCOS).  The second time I got pregnant we had been off of bc for a year so it took awhile, but I didn't need any medications.  I guess we just happened to time it right which is amazing since I have gone as long as two years between periods.  If you have an irregular cycle because of it you can still get pregnant, it just usually takes longer.  The one thing for which I was thankful when I was trying to get pregnant was that at least we knew what was wrong and it is one of the easier things to treat when TTC.\\n\\nGood luck to you and I will say a prayer!\\n\\nNancy\\nMom to one conceieved on fertility drugs, one conceived naturally and one adopted\\nIt depends on your particular circumstance.  Some women ovulate occassionally and others not at all.  Your doctor should recommend some tests to be sure.  If you are trying to conceive, you should check into finding an RE who specializes in PCOs.  Pregnancy can happen, just have faith!\\n\\nI have PCOS (I'm 18) as does my mother. She had to take fertility drugs to conceive me. The only reason I was diagnosed (when I was 13) was b/c I had started my period when I was about 9 and it had never got regular. I also had severe pain in my lower abdomen, which an u/s determined was cysts on my ovaries. I had multiple cysts on both ovaries. My dr. said it was like a string of pearls around my ovaries. I was put on birth control pills at 13 years old and have been on them ever since. I still will occasionally get a cyst here or there. As far as anything else, I was a little abnormally hairy, but the bc cleared that up. MY blood work is normal after starting bc. My mother has the abnormally hariness, protruding chest, typical body type, the whole shibang. Where as me I am lucky and have the lesser symptoms. I am sorry I cannot help as far as conceiving b/c I am only 18, but my mother had to take fertility drugs and here I am.\\nDon't give up!\\n\\ni also have pcos and i am now pregnant with my first child. what did the trick for me was taking 1500mg a day of the drug metformin/glucophage, 2 cycles of clomid, and an iui. i wanted to post and hopefully give some hope to the other ladies on this board who are ttc. there is hope for us!\\ntake care and best of luck.\\nHey! I am 21, about to get married in April, yes I am young but I was diagnosed with PCOS about 1yr 1/2  ago... I have been researching alot and reading alot of the boards about getting pregnant because I hope to have a baby one day. Has everyone had to use fertility to get pregnant?? And how long did it take to concieve?\\nI've got PCOS and had a baby this past April.  Because my periods were so irregular (wouldn't get it for months at a time), we saw a fertility specialist.  They checked my hormone levels and I had to give myself shots to ovulate (trust me, NOT as bad as it sounds!) and I was pregnant within two months.\\n\\nPrior to seeing the fertility specialist, we tried to go it alone and obviously it didn't work.  I wish I had gone directly to the fertility specialist because it would have saved a lot of time.  When you're ready to have a baby, you are much better off to see a specialist because they will monitor you and probably save you a lot of time.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'does pcos affect weight loss\\nHey Nanoose,\\n\\nI was dx\\'d with PCOS over twenty years ago and one of the things that made me question my OB/GYN at the time was that I was gaining weight but had not changed my diet/eating habits.  I also noticed my hair thinning, a sudden increase in facial hair and my cycle had stopped completely.  I went through all kinds of tests, took progesterone etc. and even tried dieting, to no avail. It wasn\\'t until my hubby and I decided to start walking every day, that I began to actually start dropping the weight, my testosterone levels dropped and my hair stopped thinning as much.  We just did about 5 miles a day, as many days as our schedules allowed and I eventually lost about 28 pounds.  My OB/GYN thinks that because I started walking every day I helped to speed up my metabolism, which set off a kind of \"hormonal chain reaction\".  This might just have been what worked for me, but when you\\'re trying to get through the frustration of PCOS, it never hurts to give it a try.  About 3-6 months after I lost the weight, I started ovulating and mestruating again and eventually became pregnant.  My cycle is normal to this day, and my doc and I still don\\'t know if thats what did it or not, but it seemed to do the trick when the meds weren\\'t working.  Good luck, I hope this helped at least a little.  cmpgirl',\n",

       " {'post': \"My doctor thinks that i have PCOS and has recommended that I take Diane 35 as a treatment for this.  I have expressed my hesitation to her on multiple occasions, but she insists that this is what I should be taking.  I dislike taking medication if I don't have to, but I am on synthroid for my hypothyroidism.\\n\\nI took birth control pills about 10 years ago and stopped taking them because my blood pressure went up.  My blood pressure seems fine, but it is in the high end of the normal range.  I am concerned about the pills affecting my blood pressure (though my doctor assured me it won't) and I don't like the idea of taking a pill with the side effects of strokes and blood clots, no matter how small the chances.\\n\\nMy symptoms that led to my diagnosis are that I get frequent, light periods.  They come every 17-21 days and are much lighter now than they used to be a few years back.  I have had shorter cycles like this for almost 2 years now.  I don't have ANY acne and rarely even get a pimple...never have.  I don't have excessive facial hair, I'm fair, so I think it's normal hair growth, but now that I know facial hair is a possible side effect of PCOS I find myself inspecting to see if the hair growth has increased!  I am not experiencing any thinning of the hair on my head either.\\n\\nIn the past few years I have gained a significant amount of weight, so I find myself wondering if my period changes are related to excessive weight more than they are related to PCOS.  I'm just so resistant to taking Diane 35, but I don't want to do more harm than good either way.\\n\\nAnyone out there taking these pills?  How have you found with them?\",\n",

       " {'post': 'My husband and I have been trying to conceive for a year.  My OB/GYN kept telling me that the reason I don\\'t have regular periods and the reason I can\\'t conceive is because I am underweight (5\\' 9\"  120 lbs).  He gave me a few cycles of clomid with no ovary response and no pregnancy.  Then I went to see a specialist.  The specialist immediately diagnosed me with PCOS.  He said it is not very common to have PCOS and be underweight, since most people are normal to overweight, but he is sure of the diagnosis.  I have all the criteria for diagnosis.\\n\\nAnyway, the specialist says that I should try Clomid one more time.  Then if it doesn\\'t work he wants me to take Metformin for a few months and then try clomid again.  He says he doesn\\'t think that either of these things will work because in his words my \"ovaries are ugly.\"  They have so many unovulated eggs.  He says he does not want to use injectable medications because my ovaries may respond too much and cause a problem like ovarian hyperstimulation.\\n\\nSo, I did some research on my own and found out that in patients who are overweight and have PCOS their fertility increased when they went on a low carbohydrate diet.  I was wondering if anyone on the board has tried that?  I couldn\\'t find any research on diet changes in underweight women with PCOS because it is not common.\\n\\nDoes anyone have any success story about diet changes and fertility?  Please let me know if you do I need a little encouragement.\\nSoleilRae,\\n\\nHello and welcome!!!\\nI don\\'t have any personal experience with PCOS but I also have a IF friend that was diagnosed not too long ago with PCOS and she doesn\\'t fit the profile either.  She actually hyperstimulated on just 50 mg of Clomid but now is on to IVF which she was monitored extremely closely.  I will let you know how that turns out since she is doing her first cycle and had her transfer today!!  She is also using Metformin.\\n\\nI wish you lots of luck and I know there are quite a few ladies here that also have PCOS and have done dietary changes.  I will let them share their stories.\\n\\nI am so glad you found us and good luck to you and hoping your stay here on the boards is short.\\n\\nSorry you have PCOS, its such an ugly medical issue.  My sister has PCOS and is under weight (5\\' 95lbs), and I also have PCOS and over weight (5\\'2\" 134lbs) and I struggle to stay around my weight.  I once weighed 215lbs and lost with LCing!!  Anyhoo.  When I eat LC I find that my face is clear of acne with a wonderful glow to my skin and if I stick to Lcing for a long period of time without sugar, pasta\\'s and breads I will have a regular 29 day cycle with ovulation on CD15.  I went almost a year like this.  Now, I take that back, that was from taking Metformin as well.  Before I took Metforim I was within \"normal\" guidlines of ahvign a cycle, but it was sparatic.  One month it would be 31 days and the next would be 27 days.  I never knew when I would start, but I was still within the normal guidlines.  Unfortunatley it has not worked for me because I have MF.  My sister was not able to get pg either and had to go off the LC diet because she got down to 85lbs.  I tried to explain to her she could eat whole wheat products, but the Dr put her on adkins or atkins, whatever its called.  On another note, my SIL has severe PCOS, over 100lbs over weight, has gone a few years without a period, major acne, major hair on her face (she has to shave her face).  She took Clomid for a month with Metformin and got pregant.  Amazing!!!\\n\\nBecause your underweight, I would be carefull with the LC, I would eat some whole wheat products.  I went to a IR dietition, you should eat all carb products before 3pm. Dinner should be meat and veggies.  ONly 2 servings of whole wheat products a day.  AND when you eat fruit & a whole wheat cracker you should add cheese.  The cycle is you need fiber to process the sugar (thus whole wheat crackers with the fruit) and you need protein to process the fiber.  This is whats considered a well balanced meal.\\n\\nI know I\\'ve gone on and on, but I hope this helps you.  LCing is an amazing thing with being IR, just amke sure you dont do too low LC because you\\'ll loose weight.  Maybe try the South Beach diet, in the maintence phase, that is a really good well balanced plan.\\n\\nGood luck!\\nMy doctors had conflicting thoughts on whether or not I had pcos because I didn\\'t not fit the \"norm\" for it either - I was 5\\'8 and 125 lbs and never had issues with my skin.  After seeing an endocrinologist, I was put on Metformin; however, it really bothered my stomach so I did not continue on it.  We tried a few months of clomid with this doctor, but had no success at all.  I finally saw a fertility specialist who confirmed the pcos diagnosis and took blood work, including my insulin levels.  Obviously, I came back with a high insulin level and he told me I had two months to go on a low carb/low sugar diet - almost a form of Atkins - and then he would re-check me to see if we could then move forward.  Basically, I cut out ALL regular soda (I don\\'t drink coffee, I drink soda) and switched to diet, cut out all my sweets and really cut back on carbs.  Two months later I was within normal range and was allowed to proceed with injections and was pregnant within two months.\\n\\nI hope this has given you some info.  Good luck!\\n',\n",

       " {'post': \"About two weeks ago, I had my annual exam with my GYN/midwife and I had some pain in my stomach when she pressed down.  She sent me for an ultrasound where it was discovered that I have a 5cm simple cyst on my left ovary.  I am 27 yrs old, never been pregnant, and been on OC (Ortho tricyclen) for about 6 years or so.  I'm concerned (1) because of the size, and (2) because I got this cyst while on the pill.  I'm really nervous.  I've been having dull aches in that region, as well as lower back pain and bloating.\\n\\nMy doctor wants to wait 2 months and do a follow up ultrasound.  I just don't feel comfortable with this, as stated previously why.  Has anyone else ever developed cysts while on the pill?  Should I wait the two months, or push for surgery?  Please, any advice!  Thanks!\\nIf it was me, I would wait.  You're really young (most ovarian cancer happens to women in their 50's) and it's a simple cyst.\\n\\nI just had a 4.6cm complex cyst and 6 weeks later it was gone.\\n\\nGood luck!\\nHi Skimmy:   I'm not sure, from your post, if you've been diagnosed with PCOS, or if this is an isolated thing.  Having had PCOS for almost 20 years, I have constant, benign cysts on both ovaries at one time or another.  The largest one I've had is about 6.5 cm.  According to my OB/GYN, he doesn't usually even consider surgery under 10 cm.  He will have me come in every 6 weeks or so, when I get a larger one.  They'll do an ultrasound and watch it for growth or shrinkage.  Mine have always shrunk on their own over time and I've only had minimal pain/discomfort with them. (Thank God) Cysts sometimes occur because of even mild hormoneal imbalances and my doc said they are almost always benign.  I would say that if your discomfort/pain gets worse or if you begin bleeding off cycle, then you should call the office and let them know, but for now, it sounds like your doc knows what he/she is doing.  Hope this helps.   cmpgirl\\nThank you!  I hope it goes away on its own.  It just concerns me because I don't know why I got one in the first place since I have been on birth control for a while.\\nI have not been diagnosed with PCOS, I just wasn't sure where to post about this.  The pain has been mild, but constant, and more uncomfortable than anything, especially in the back.  I guess, like i said, I just wonder why I got a cyst in the first place since I have been on birth control for so long.  From everything I have read, it is pretty uncommon.  I have a good doctor, and I trust her, I just need to relax.\\n\\nHi Skimmy,\\n\\nSee my reply to your most recent post.  A unilocular, simple, fluid filled ovarian cyst is the most unthreatening type of cyst you can get and you can get one while on the pill (I did and mine is 7.5 cm).  It may very well be a follicular cyst which disappears during the next few cycles.  As cmpgirl mentioned in the earlier post, they usually do not perform surgery if your cyst is under 10 cm and in your case, the cyst does not look threatening.\\n\\nAs difficult as it is (and believe me, I know), try to keep yourself busy over the next little while and go for that next ultrasound.  If the cyst is still there at that time then your doctor may give you the choice (as mine did) to either have surgery or to keep getting regular ultrasounds to keep an eye on it.  I personally have opted for the regular ultrasounds.\\n\\nTake care.\\nThank you for your responses.  It is tough to not worry about something growing in your body, especially when it is causing you some pain.  I just need to relax, and do the follow up ultrasound, and pray it has not grown or anything like that.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Basically I have fatty liver, gallstones, kidney infection, low \"good\" cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes.  I have just been diagnosed with PCOS but if I take metformin i have a highly increased chance of having lactic acidosis (death usually occurs), I can\\'t take birth control or progesterone/provera/etc because of my circulation in my body (from the type 2 diabetes) and I would really not rather have a blood clot. And I have extremely thick endometrium and I have not had my period since February I\\'d say.  I\\'ve tried losing weight but it\\'s just not happening (exercise and dieting) so I guess my question is, what route would you take in order to have your period?  Can I take birth control for a month and then stop?  Will this reduce my risk of having blood clots or a heart attack?  I am definately not touching metformin, the side effects are keeping me away and id rather never menstrate and get endometriosis than take those horrid pills.\\nDoes anyone know a holistic way of menstrating?\\nFrom what I understand (I\\'m far from being an expert, so bare with me), Metformin is the \"only\" thing that can correct all these issues.  I was on birth control and it didn\\'t do anything but suppress issues related with PCOS and give me blood clots.  I am now on Metformin with the hopes of regaining my life back, period too, but there are no guarantees.\\n\\nIf I were you, I wouldn\\'t mess with birth control.  If you are overweight and have diabetes, you\\'re almost sure to get blood clots.  I think Provera would be the way to go...my doctor recommended it to me, and I have tried it before, but it didn\\'t do anything because my lining was not thick enough to shed.  If yours is thick enough (that\\'s usually case), I think the doctor would suggest Provera.  I don\\'t know all the risks associated with it, but I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s a better alternative than birth control.\\n\\nObviously I don\\'t want to give you bad advice, so talk with your doctor about your concerns.  I really hope things start looking up for you!\\nHi, just wanted to let you know that I also have fatty liver which is caused from PCOS, I am insulin resistant and reactive hypoglycemic, and have low good cholesterol, and thyroid, as well as adrenal and neuro problems.  I take metformin and when I first took it about 12 years ago it was a horrid experience and I would never take it again.  I am now on Metformin ER and it is not as bad.  I have adjusted to feel fine on 2 a day 1000mg after about 4 mos. and I feel ok.  I am also on thyroid meds and working on dealing with the neuro stuff so I feel pretty good considering everything.  It has cut my triglycerides in half on one and even more on 2.  If you are afraid of the metformin, talk to your doctor and see if they can prescribe that and maybe you can even start with half a pill a day 250mg.  Most docs start on 500mg but the holistic MD\\'s start with 250.  Maybe you would do better that way.  The side effects of the birth conrol pills have always been worse for me than the metformin.  It is probably better (in my opinion), to take the metformin and regulate triglycerides, sugar, cholesterol, and hormones (which it is doing for me) and also this will give you regular cycles, I have one every month to month and a half now.  I used to only have one every 6 to 12 months.  Which of your problems causes you the most fear of taking metformin??  I would find a doctor who is very experienced with PCOS, and willing to work with you.  Good Luck. Keep us posted!!!\\nMetformin causes lactic acidosis which is  an underlying process of rigor mortis and it\\'s fatal.  The chances of getting lactic acidosis are greatly increased if you have heart disease, kidney problems, and liver disease (which as of right now I have all 3).  Along with this I still have to get gallbladder surgery...sometime so I am extremely anxious to take this medication.  This crap has a very bad side effect and for healthy people it doesn\\'t seem to cause any problems.........\\nI don\\'t blame you for being afraid.  I just got really sick from another medication I was taking and the symptoms were all like lactic acidosis, so I ended up in the emergency room, just to find out that it was from the other medicine, and that since it made me so sick, I was so dehydrated and my stomach was just acid, and became spastic, and now I can\\'t eat anything much, and it has to be broth, simple carbs, etc, which of course is horrible for the PCOS, but I also stopped taking my metformin, and my liver enzymes have returned to normal (so apparently the doc was wrong when they said it was from the PCOS, cause I still have that!!!), and I don\\'t feel so sick.  I think I might stay off it for a while, and just try to lose some weight on my own, and try a diet routine that is good for PCOS.  I\\'ll let you know how all that goes.  I am kind of scared to start taking it again.  Maybe we can exchange info about success (hopefully) without Metformin!!!!  But I still want to try to find a better doctor!!',\n",

On the 12th (19th) and 13th(20th) day I took ovulation tests and it's showing that I'm not ovulating. I was told to take the ovulation tests between the 12th and 16th day (from the beginning of my period). I guess I could be getting ahead of myself because technically I have about 3 more days to see if I ovulate. But it was a real let down to see on those 2 tests I wasn't ovulating.

I was only diagnosed about 7 years ago. I have been taking metfomin 500mg 3xs daily for the past 2 years. I also take clomid and provera(10 each month-but not every month). The first month on clomid , i did not ovulate. I have ovulated the next three months though. I was on 50 mg of clomid for three months and this month i was upped to 100 mg. I would definitely ask your doctor about waiting on the provera. I didnt take mine until i was sure that i didnt ovulate. I didnt ask my doctor but i just decided not to chance it. Good luck and i look forward to hearing from you.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nHELLO!  Thank you for replying, I almost gave up on this website.\\nI also should be taking the metformin twice a day on a daily basis.  But when I started taking the 500mg twice daily it was making me feel really crappy.  I had diarrhea and just felt sick.  I know those are the side effects of that but I just could handle it.  I was going to the bathroom like 4-5 a day.  So I stopped taking it =/  After my first month of Clomid and seeing that I wasn't ovulating I gave up on that too.  My husbands insurance doesn't cover anything to help me get pregnant so I figured bag this whole pregnancy thing until we are SUPER baby hungry.\\nI did go to this new doctor and she told me not to take the provera again until day 15 or whatever and I know I am NOT pregnant.  But seems as though (like with everything else) that the Dr.'s and Nurses usually say something different than all the others.\\nBut I was wondering, if you did ovulate 3 months after the first month, how come the Dr upped your dosage to 100mg from 50mg????\\nAnywho, thanx for replying!!!!!\\nWell here is my strory.\\n\\nI have been ttc for 2 years and my problem was that I did not ovulate, I was put on clomid 50mg and I ovulated the first time round, the Dr told me it takes about three cycles to get pg. I took clomid for three cycles and ovulted all three times with no pg. I then ha to take a break for two months and start clomid again. The 4 round I got my BFP but sadly it ended with a blighted ovum. I then took another round of clomid and did not react at all, no ovulation. I went to a RE three weeks ago and was diagnosed with PCOS. My insulin levels were at 15 day 3 of my cycle, my RE did some ovarian drilling last week to break down some of the androgen levels, I am hoping that it has worked....only time will tell . My Re has put me on glucophage and BCP for this month and when AF shows I will starts with Gonal-F injections. I am really hoping that I will get my BFP by the end of November.\\n\\nI also suffered from severe hot flushes, weight gain and nausea. I am so glad that I do not have to take it again. The thing with clomid is you cannot take it for longer than 6 cycles or so I have heard.\\n\\n\\nI hope this helps\\n\\nCharlene\\nYeah when I was on clomid just for 1 round.

Being that at the time I was in high school and my mother had low income, we had no family doctor. So when I finally found a full time job with benefits, I picked out a doctor ASAP. The Doctor put me metformin. My periods was normal for awhile and then in February of 2006 I lost my job and there went my benefits.

However, I think that it is crucial you spend whatever money you need to go see a doctor.  What\\'s the point of letting it get worse?  Then you\\'ll be stuck paying MAJOR doctor bills.  Maybe the pain you\\'re experiencing isn\\'t stemmed from PCOS, maybe it\\'s a kidney stone.  Let the doctor do an examination, provide some medication, and put your mind at ease.  It\\'ll really be worth it.\\n\\nI may be wrong, but I think it can turn into cancer if you don\\'t get your period and the lining continues to build up.  (Maybe there are other cancers too???) If you\\'re like me - my lining is too thin it doesn\\'t matter - my doctor told me there\\'s nothing to worry about, nothing I can have done.\\n\\nI wish you the best of luck, and pleasant healthy days to come!  But like I said before, don\\'t be shy about spending money on your health - it\\'s the only body you\\'ve got, treat it well!\\nI am an older  PCOS. LOL   there is no posting board me.........: )\\n\\nI can share with you that I had untreated PCOS. I am 54 now and just started on Metformin.......Back when I was younger no one really knew alot about it..called it Stein Levensol or something like that........I had periods but did not ovulate.....I fortunately had 3 children, the last 2 with Clomid and Pergonal.......2 miscarriages and a ruptured ectopic from a copper 7 IUD.\\n\\nI had alot of pelvic pain and heavy periods, problems with body hair and weight gain in my tummy area.........had more than my share of ruptured cysts.......but that all resolved and I had no other problems until I got around 47 and started having weight gain and high blood pressure......and at 54 I am still NOT in menopause......??????\\n\\nat my age they call PCOS Metabolic Syndrome...........anovulation, weight gain, hiturism, high blood pressure, elevated triglycerides.......now on the Metformin I feel so much better and my weight is dropping off. I do diet and exercise daily......It is really important to stay healthy and do your part.\\n\\nI would definately get to the Doctor and find out what your pain is about.........it could be endometriosis or a bad bladder infection......you want to make sure you do not have a pelvic infection. It needs to be checked out.\\n\\nDo not worry about getting cancer...  try to stay in the now and get your immediate problem solved.........if you have no insurance go to your local health Dept or if you live by a Teaching University Medical Center go see a resident in the Reproductive Endocrinology Dept.........they usually will see you on ability to pay...........Just a thought.\\n\\nGood Luck and let us know how you are doing............. get checked out......\\n\\nOleander\\nThanks to all of the responses to my post. I\\'m glad that ya\\'ll have responded and I\\'m going to take some of ya\\'ll advice. I hope that the response keep on coming and I will keep in touch with ya\\'ll with my health. Thanks for the support.\\nHi,\\n\\nI know that i have had PCOS since i was 19. I am now 32 and have only been diagnosed for the past 6 years. My mom had it too. It took visiting a few dr\\'s for them to realize what i had. I went for one year having a constant period to almost two years with no period at all. I actually thought this was normal, since i never had a regular cycle. I have bleed so bad that i had to be rushed to the ER several times. I reccomend finding about state health insurance or even visiting a health department or free clinic. I am on metformin 500mg 3 times daily for my PCOS. I also have metabolic syndrome too, which is where the weight gain comes in. PCOS and Metabolic syndrome combined are now being called syndromeX. I wish you luck. I would call around until you can find someone to see you that is familiar with this condition or willing to research it enough to properly treat you.',\n",

Thanks in advance for your answers.\\nIn my opinion the pill doesn\\'t really do much (if anything) to \"treat\" PCOS, it just covers up the symptoms.  I was on the pill for over 11 years and towards the end it wasn\\'t even masking the symptoms of PCOS anymore.\\n\\nI had to stop taking the pill due to blood clots in my lungs and after I stopped the PCOS was worse than it had ever been before.

I\\'m 28 years old and I was this close to crying on the phone to my mum (thankfully I held back)\\n\\nAnyway... I\\'ve had no period for 4 years.  I had weight loss to begin with, but then rapid weight gain.  I now live at the gym, but where I used to love it, I now hate it.  I have no energy and eat a ridiculously low-cal diet, pertified of anything that\\'s remotely been near fat, let alone contains it.  I have managed to get my weight down again - somewhere near normal, but it is SUCH a struggle, I just don\\'t know how to keep it up.  I\\'m scared to admit that to the doctor though, and they have me down as some kind of weight obsessed freak.  I\\'m not obsessed - I just want to be a normal healthy weight, but I really really do have to live at the gym and eat the stupid way I do to achieve \"normal\" - otherwise it just piles on.\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'ve been to the docs a few times due to lack of periods, but they always seem to pat my head (not literally, but you know what I mean) and say there-there go away for a few months and they\\'ll come back... which is how I\\'ve got to four years without a single one.\\n\\nThe reason I\\'ve been going back again recently is for horrendous pains I\\'m getting down the right side of my abdomen.  That\\'s what made them send me for a UV scan which has shown both ovaries at PS, and a tiny cyst on the right side (2cm).  Apparently it\\'s tiny tiny so I don\\'t need to bother with it, but they seem to forget it hurts like anything - I\\'m not sleeping because of it and have had mornings where I literally can\\'t get out of bed.\\n\\nThe treatment they\\'ve given me is the pill (\"marvelon\") but I\\'m terrified of going on that because I\\'m battling with my weight so badly already and I think it\\'s generally accepted you put pounds on with that.... so I decided that I\\'m not going to take it, but then read PCOS make you prone to weight gain... and whether or not I take it, I\\'m stuffed with thunderous pains down my right side because of the cyst.  Should I just do nothing, take no extra medication except painkillers, and continue my current work-out... but then I don\\'t know how I can do that...I\\'m just going to burn out.\\n\\nI\\'m so so sorry to post such an angst fuelled angry post (I\\'m such a quiet thing in person), but I JUST don\\'t know what to do.  I haven\\'t even been referred to a specialist - can I ask for that??  I\\'ve booked in another appointment tomorrow, but right now I just feel I\\'m going to go in and cry... I hate to waste their time, but what I am to do?\\n\\nIf anyone is out there who feels similar, any advice or someone just to say I\\'m not crazy... please anything will help.\\nHi JJ95\\n\\nFirstly I would like to welcome you to the boards.\\n\\nThere is no reason to feel bad, you have a right to be angry. I was diagnosed 3 weeks ago with PCOS and I felt the same way. I had to go to a fertility specialist to find out as my Gyn here failed to pick it up after 5 years under his care. I have also gained 12 kg in the last 2 years and I also live in the gym, I know exactly how you feel. I have been put on glucophage for my insulin levels and some ladies say they have lost a lot of weight on it. So I am hoping it will do the same for me. I cannot comment on whether or not to take the pill as I am ttc. I am sure someone here wil be able to give you some advise. I hope you appointment goes well tomorrow and the Dr will beable to give you something for the pain. I am sure if you ask to be referred to a specialistthen they have to refer you. I am not sure how it works. I am on private medical aid so the dr here has to refer e whether he wants to or not.\\n\\nGood luck and let me know how it goes. Thinking of you.\\n\\nCharlene\\nHi JJ95,\\nWelcome to healthboards.  Wow you sound exactly like me when I was first diagnosed about 10 years ago.  And NO, you are NOT crazy, it\\'s normal for you to be angry and confused and lost.  This is all new to you and it\\'s going to take time for you to come to terms with yourself and with PCOS.  What I can suggest to you is to ask to be referred to a good specialist.  I go to an IVF doctor who is specialized in PCOS.  In the beginning, I also was not getting my periods so he put me on the pill (Yasmin).  You know, the pill wasn\\'t so bad because I did get my periods on a regular basis and I didn\\'t gain that much weight.  My doctor also put me on Metformin.  Many women with PCOS are prescribed this medication, so when you go to another appointment mention this medication to your doctor.  But just so you know, if you do go on Metformin it will take some time for you to get used to it because it causes nausea, vomiting, constipation, but on a good note, it might help you lose the weight a bit easier and for some women the periods come back on their own, it will also help control your blood sugar.  Please keep in mind that everyone is different, Yasmin and Metformin were very good for me, but they might not be for you, so make sure your doctor runs all necessary test before taking these or any other pills.\\nI would also suggest for you to do a lot of research on PCOS and really try to understand it.  It\\'s good that you already go to the gym and eat healthy because those are the two main things doctors suggest for PCOS.  I was also overweight but I lost about 25lbs also by exercising and eating healthy.  I went off the pill about a month ago because my husband and I are ready for children, but nothing yet (cross you fingers).\\nWhat I can tell you about my personal experience with PCOS is that you\\'ll learn to live with it and you\\'ll learn to control it.  Don\\'t let it control you.  And don\\'t go through this by yourself, tell a best friend, a sister your mom, it\\'s always good to have someone who will help you through this, and if you feel like crying go ahead don\\'t hold back, it\\'s normal to just let everything out.\\nI wish you well,\\nYour friend\\nHello ladies.\\n\\nFirstly a huge thank you for your kind messages - you really don\\'t know how much I appreciate your support.\\n\\nI went back for my appointment, and asked to be referred which is now in progress.  This is a relief in itself - I\\'ll be able to see someone who has seen patients going through exactly what I am experiencing, so that definitely gives me comfort that I\\'m doing something postive.\\n\\nSolange3000 you are so right about the research.  I\\'m like a sponge for PCOS information at the moment (it\\'s amazing how much you learn in 24 hours!) and will continue to do all the research I need.\\n\\nI don\\'t really have any friends close enough to talk about things like this, so thank-you once again - you\\'ve really helped me come to terms with what this might mean for me.\\n\\n~J\\n\\nPS:  I would love to be blessed with children one day and I\\'ll keep my fingers tightly crossed for you\\n\\nThanks JJ95, I\\'m glad that we could help you and that you are feeling a little better.  This healthboard is to try to help people like you and me, so whenever you need a friend we\\'ll be here for you.\\nI\\'m glad you are doing the research and are going to be referred to a good doctor, believe me, it will help you a lot.\\n\\nThank you for crossing your fingers.  I\\'ll let you know if anything happens.\\nI have been told that I MAY have PCOS (go for more test when I start my mesus again). I seem to have a lot of PCOS symptoms, but I seem to have symptoms of other things too. One question is does PCOS cause constant pain EVERY day?',\n",

       " {'post': 'I found out today that I probably have PCOS, waiting for results of blood work.  I am a lot overwhelmed with information.  I wanted to ask real women with PCOS what to expect?\\n\\n~Heather\\nJust came back from the doctors and been told that I might have PCOS, got to have ultrasound.\\n\\nDoes anyone out there who has it or been told there might give me help ?\\nWelcome, ladies. PCOS isn\\'t fun at all, but luckily it IS treatale in a number of different ways. first off, your Insulin and testosterone levels may or may not be high. Typically they are high, though. If your insulin is high, then you will most likely be given Metformin. (I\\'m not quite sure abotu blood levels, as mine were all normal)\\n\\nAt an ultrasound, or u/s (easier to type) they will either do a normal abdominable u/s, or a vaginal u/s or possibly both. I had both, bt the vaginal u/s was much more clear and showed exactly how many cysts I had on each ovary. (they also foudn a polyp) The vaginal u/s does not hurt at all!\\n\\n\\nAfter that, the treatment depends on your goals. If you just want a regular period, you\\'ll be put on the Pill. If you want kids, you\\'ll probably be put on clomid or do ovarian drilling. If you just want to ovulate on your own and have a regular period, you\\'ll probably get provera or metformin.\\n\\nI\\'m not a doctor and there are exceptions to every rule, as every PCO patient is different. One woman might have all the classic symptoms, another woman might have none, another woman might have Symptom A and B, another woman might have Symptoms B and F, so on.\\n\\nBut i hope this helped a bit!!\\n\\nThank you for your reply!  I came off of my bc in July to get pregnant.  I went to the doc b/c of severe bleeding & cramps.  He did a vaginal u/s & saw that my ovaries were twice their normal size & filled with cysts.  He wants me to do an at home ovulation predictor, but he is doubtful that I am ovulating.  After the results of that he will start me on glucophage & see if I start ovulating, then maybe try clomid.  I just wanted to take my time ttc, but already it kinda feels like a race!\\n\\nIs the glucophage going to cause the cysts (and pain) to go away so that I may actually want to have sex?\\n\\n~Heather\\nI was also diagnosed with PCOS three weeks ago. After ttc for two years I went to a RE and he found that I have PCOS and my insulin levels are high. I am currently trying to ween myself on to glucophage but it make me feel sick most of the time. I have also had ovarian drilling done. I am not going to wait to see if I ovulate (O) on my own, as we have wasted so much time already with clomid, I start with injectables at the end of October. Once I have had my babies I will see if I can O on my own.\\n\\nGood luck to you and ttc.\\n\\nCharlene\\nHi Heather, I\\'m also trying to get pregnant, I stopped taking the pill a month ago and my doctor told me to continue taking Metformin also known as glucophase.  I know what you mean about the pain during sex and I don\\'t think the glucophase will stop the pain and it\\'s not going to stop the cysts.  I have been on Metformin for 3 years now and sometimes I still feel some discomfort and pain during sex.  My cysts have been there forever and I might have them for the rest of my life.  The glucophage will help you control your blood sugar levels.  This drug is mainly used in type 2 diabetics but it was also found to be helpful for women with PCOS to lower their sugar levels and increase their chances of getting pregnant.\\n\\nAs far as what you can expect from having PCOS is that you need to be able to take control of it.  It\\'s definitely something you can live with, you just need to know how to.  There is going to be many down moments, at least there were for myself.  At first a felt very confused, angry, depressed and mad at myself.  But I eventually accepted I had PCOS and dicided to do something about it.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t exercise or eat healthy I suggest you start doing that now.  If you don\\'t take care of your health and you have PCOS it can cause major health problem later in life, such as, diabetes and heart problems.  Just like PrincessSweet said every woman is different and some of the symptoms I have might not be the same as the ones you have.  So make sure you have a good specialist you can talk to and answers all your questions.\\nAlthough I\\'m \"ok\" living with PCOS, there are always going to be challenges and difficulties.  My next challenge is getting pregnant which is very difficult for women with PCOS. But I have a lot of hope and faith that it will happen soon.\\n\\nAll the best to you.\\nSolange, how long has it been since you found out you had PCOS?  This diagnosis has really scared me & thrown me for a loop.\\n\\nI am trying to work on my diet & exercise & I quit smoking 6 weeks ago (yay me) preparing to ttc.  My doctors (GP & OB/GYN) are both great men that I trust completely.  I am doing ovulation predictor tests now to see if I am ovulating on my own.  When I finish with that I am starting the glucophage.\\n\\nFinding out I have PCOS has kicked  my biological clock into high gear & it is ticking loudly; I am baby crazy.  It took me 2 years to get pregnant with my 5 yo & I really don\\'t think I can wait that long this time!  The only good thing is the cheapness of ovulation predictor kits now.  They are alot better than taking my temp every morning for months like I did 7 years ago!\\n\\nGood luck to you with ttc, I am sending baby dust your way!\\n\\n~Heather\\nHi Heather, I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 23, I\\'ll be 33 in a couple of months.  But I think I\\'ve had it since I was about 17 because that\\'s when I started missing my periods.  Like I said, I was very scared at first and I didn\\'t really know what PCOS was all about.  I got information by talking to my doctors and also by doing research on the internet.   I think by you being on this healthboard and talk to women who have PCOS is a step in the right direction.  Congrats on stopping the smoking, I know it\\'s extremely hard but it\\'s another step in the right direction.\\n\\nIt\\'s great that you already have a kid and to me that\\'s even more hope that you\\'ll be able to conceive again.  Just think positive and try no to be stressed, stress can have a negative impact in your health.\\nI\\'m also checking the see if I\\'m ovulating properly, I have to take my temperature every morning, it\\'s a pain but I\\'ll do anything to TTC at this point.\\n\\nThanks for the baby dust, I feel much better already.\\nOk, yesterday I started bleeding again!  Fourth time since Sept 12th.  Has anyone else had this happen or know why it may be happening?  I\\'m about to lose my mind!',\n",

On birth control my hormonal moods were better, but it gave me a headache.  My doctor checked my thyroid level immediately.  The diabetes dx happened when my liver enzymes were a little high and they did full blood tests.  He explained that PCOS puts you at a higher risk for being overweight or obese, the weight in the mid section, Diabetes, high blood pressure, and ovarian cysts/irregular menstral cycles. Some people have acne, facial hair, skin tags, hair loss. The treatment usually consists of the doctor recommending you become or in your case stay active, watch your weight.  I would have your blood sugar tested annually, blood pressure taken occasionally just to keep an eye on things.  If you aren\\'t trying to get pregnant they usually prescribe birth control. It keeps your cycle regular which helps prevent cancer from the lining building up for too long.',\n",

No serious side effects, and have lost about 15 pounds since starting the medication.\\n\\nI was told to stop the doxycycline, which I did.\\n\\nI also initially started on Aldactone at 25mg once a day, and was switched from Yasmin to Zovia.  My acne problems returned shortly after starting the Aldactone/Zovia combination.  The Aldactone was increased to 50mg a day (25mg with breakfast and 25mg with dinner).  This was about 3/4 of a way through a pack of Zovia.\\n\\nAround this time I started having break through bleeding which then developed into full on heavy bleeding (like my period).  My Dr switched me back to Yasmin.  The bleeding is not as heavy, but it is definitely still constant.  I've also been having some issues of dizziness with the Aldactone (I have low blood pressure to begin with).\\n\\nAs an athlete the constant bleeding is unacceptable.  I was completely happy not having/rarely having a period (pregnancy is not an issue).  I've read that the bleeding can be controlled via birth control pills.  The question is: what kind of birth control pills could stop the side effect of the aldactone?  Clearly not Yasmin or Zovia.  What other options are available?\\n\\nI would greatly appreciate any input or advice.\\nWelcome to the boards. I unfortunatley cannot answer you question regarding your meds. I would suggest you speak to your endocronlogist and asked her if there are any BCP you can take.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Salut ladies, forgive my english, I speak french as a first language so soemtimes I make no sense in english\\n\\nEveryone, please be honest, if you have taken metformin, does it actually work? Does it get rid of the extra pounds (or stones, depending were you live) and unwanted man hair? Most importantly, does it make you ovulate? Or will I have to take metformin with clomid?\\n\\nAny/all answers are more than welcome!! Merci!\\nI did not loose weight on metformin, however it made my cycles much more regular. I took metformin in combination with clomid for 2 cycles and I did not ovulate those 2 cycles, I needed prometrium to make me get my period.\\n\\nI then took 2 months of birth control pills, while on vacation. when we returned home I stopped the pills, the next month I conceived.\\n\\ngood luck!\\nI have taken Metformin for about 4 months and I\\'ve lost 15 lbs (I also have not been able to eat much, so that may be part of it!).\\nThe Met will not do a thing about the hair growth.  Some women, including myself, have had some luck with spironolactone (aldactone) which is a diuretic.  I had some excess hair on my lower back and it disappeared after a few months.  The facial hair growth slowed down, but has not completely gone.  If you have dark hair, laser hair removal might be your best bet.  It doesn\\'t work very well on light colored hair.\\nThank yo uladies, for your wonderful help\\nI have not yet seen the octor yet, as my appoitnemtn got cancelled\\nI am very worried that he will just put me on BCP. I do not want to be on BCP, beucase we are trying to have baby, but at the same time, we\\'re not wanting to try Clomid yet either. Do you think he will help me?? Et, Austex spironolactone (aldactone), this is for PCOS, orjust to get rid of the unwanted hair? Or how is it used....with Met?\\nYes, the metformin and sprio work very well.  Between the two meds, all your symptoms should get treated.  The doctor will try very hard to put you on the birth control pill, but DON\\'T.  It just makes things worse in the long run, and makes you dependent on it.  It also contributes to your insulin resistance and causes an buch of problems of its own.  I am on all three meds, and I hate the bcp.\\nMerci, Lisa!\\nI will have to fight being on BCP...I hate it so much, and even when I was on it my period wasn\\'t regular. Metofrmin makes period regular, non? It sounds great for weight loss....but I\\'m worried about regular period too.\\nI have been on Metformin for a year now.  I started at 500 mg and am up to 2,000 mg daily.  It hasn\\'t done anything positive for me!  I actually gained a bit of weight.  I have not had a period with out forcing one with Provera (another drug), and I\\'m a gastrointestinal mess - daily diarrhea.  My doctor still doesn\\'t want me to stop it just yet because I only recently went up to 2,000 mg - the highest dosage.\\nHello Ladies, I tell you it\\'s amazing what you find out when you research and read certain things.  I\\'m very baffled.  I take Metformin because I take prednisone and it\\'s makes my blood sugar go high so I recently was put on Metformin to control my blood sugars and it works.  But this thing about periods, weight loss, and hair removal is all new to me. I\\'m 48, no period, size 2 weighing about 112 pounds and all my children are grown and i\\'m loving it, you talk about going back to the drawing board on this one, my doctor and I need to talk asap LOL  I was already to share how it works for me, but to my surprise\\nIf you all can shed some more light on this please let me know.  Felicia\\n\\nFirst of all, DO NOT get on the birth control pill if you might be TTC soon. I am currently 23 weeks pregnant, and I honestly believe that Metformin is the reason why. Over an 8 month period of time, it helped me lose over 30 pounds and allowed me to ovulate regularly. Best of all, it helped us get pregnant! We did not have to use Clomid. I have not had any negative side effects being on 1,000 mg. of Metformin a day. I encourage you to request the Metformin XR (extended release) version as it has fewer side effects than a regular dosage.\\nHello Ladies,\\n\\nI am new to this forum but have been suffering with PCOS for about 12 years now.  Its a long story but about 5 years ago I went to see a doctor for the melasma on my face and she took one look at me and said exactly what medications i needed and what was wrong with me!  Until then i had been told a million different reasons for my obvious weight gain and melasma, hair and the like!  Im sure you all know...So at that point I started going to her and she put me on Metformin and Spironolactone and I have dropped approx. 50 lbs. and the hair growth is marginally better.  I feel alot better and would not stop taking these two meds for anything!  Every so often I need to have the dosage increased.  Does anyone else have this as well?  The only side effect i get is ovarian cysts!  anyone else with that problem?\\n\\nIts really comforting to listen to other women with the same issue as me!  I am glad you are here!!!\\nHi, I have PCOS and I\\'ve been taking Metforming for about 3 years.  It did regulate my periods and my doctor told me it would increase my chances of getting pregnant by 30%. At the time we weren\\'t ready to have a baby so I decided to go on the pill.  Also my doctor had told me I needed to lose some weight.  Although I was on metformin during the first 2 years I did not lose any weight because I didn\\'t diet or workout.  This past January I started dieting and excercising and I lost 22 pounds.  My husband and I are now ready to have children and my doctor tells me it\\'s same to start trying because I\\'ve lost 11% of my body fat.  I went off the pill 1 week ago but I\\'m still taking metforming.  Regarding the hair problem, metformin slowed down the hair growth on my chin but it always came back.  I tried laser hair removal and it didn\\'t work, then I went to an electrolysis and the treatment took a year and it was a little painfull but well worth it, currently I have no hairs at all on my chin, upper lip and on the sides.  I love metformin I\\'m one of the lucky ones who had no major problems with it only some nausea in the first month.  For me, the combination of Metformin with dieting and exercising lowerd my blood sugar and bad cholesterol.\\nOh wow ladies, i am so glad that this thread is still getting posts!\\n\\n\\nCongratulations Hailey, that is wonderful news. Your story is an inspiration to me-- as I have PCOS I am finding it pretty near impossible to get pg. Are you having a boy or a girl?\\n\\nHi Amy!! Thank you for replying, and I\\'m so glad you go thte help you were lookign for! That\\'s the thing about PCOS, isn\\'t it, it presents as a bunch of different, seemingly unrelated problems. My former (evil) gyn said that I have acne, hirsutism and am fat. (She didnt say overweight, no no, she said fat) Congrats on losing that weight! Just a quick question though--- what is Spironolactone?\\n\\nSolange- congrats on losing the weight! 22 lbs!! It\\'s H3LL for me to even lose 2lbs!!!!!!! I really hope you conceive quickly and have a safe, fun pregnancy.\\n\\nNonname -let us knwo how you are doing!!\\n\\nI have my final gyn apt tomorrow when they tell me which drugs they will put me on--- I am not ready for Clomid yet, but I DO NOT want them to pull a \"We\\'ll put you on BCP, and when you want a baby, we\\'ll put you on Clomid\"\\n\\nI have the right to say no to BCP right?\\nYes, Metformin made my cycles completely regular with ovulation!  I used to only get 3-4 periods in a year...I love this drug...also it has aided in weight loss for me, along with diet and exercise...with regards to unwanted hair...hasn\\'t done anything...however, laser hair removal is a good option...expensive, but worth it...hasn\\'t gotten rid of it completely for me, but in 5 sessions, it\\'s much, much lighter and less of it  :-)\\n[QUOTE=Nonname -let us knwo how you are doing!![/QUOTE]\\n\\nI just changed doctors and my new doctor told me I could stop the Metformin because it wasn\\'t doing anything positive for me.  I\\'m currently doing the South Beach Diet to lose some of the PCOS-related belly fat.  It\\'s been 3 weeks and I\\'ve lost 10 pounds already.  I\\'m just going to keep plugging along and hopefully will TTC with Metformin, Clomid and IUI in the spring/summer!',\n",

       " {'post': \"how to get pregnant if one has thyroid and polycyctic ovaries\\nI'm not quite sure if I should be writing this here, maybe the Infertility board would be better, but I'll try it out. Talk to your RE or gyn, they can help you get on a regimen where you can treat both your thyroid and PCOS to have a baby. Good luck!!\\n\\nThe most important thing before you try to get pregnant is to work with your family/regular doctor to make sure your thyroid levels are stable with or without the medication.  Which given that you know you have it, I would imagine that you have already been working with a doctor.\\n\\nI myself have the same condition as you, I am hypothyroid and have PCOS.  I have been on the same dose of Synthroid for about 6 years now.  In addition, I have been taking metformin for my PCOS to help my cycles come on for a few years.  I recently went to see a Gyno to find out what he thought my chances were for getting pregnant.  He made it very clear that I need to continue the use of the synthoid and the metformin.  He then proceded to give me clomid to make me fertile.  I have just completed the first round and nothing happened.  I will be starting my next round in about 2 weeks and he said I should be pregnant by the end of the year.\\n\\nI was completely shocked at this comment.  4 years ago I saw a gyno and she told me that I would never be able to get pregnant, and if I did I would never be able to carry it to full term.  Trust me, keep the faith and just be patient but persistant.  Make sure your blood work numbers are good, then see the gyno.  A good gyno can do miracles.  Good luck!\\nI agree with dolphin on this one if you see a good gyne anything is possible. I am on glucophage/metfomin 1500mg per day. I have been on 5 cycles of clomid and now  am on an injectable cycle. I would suggest you see a fertility specialist to discuss your options.\\n\\nGood luck and Baby Dust\",\n",

My doctor warned me about that, anyone else have these side effects and if so, did they ever go away??\\nThanks\\nI just started taking Metformin at the beginning of July.  I found I was really nauseous at first but taking it with food really helped and after about 2 weeks the nausea seems to have subsided.  But must take it with food or I feel like complete crap!  I hope you start to feel better on it!\\n\\nWhen they started me on Metformin (2,000mg/day) for PCOS (August, 2006), the nausea and loose BM\\'s never subsided. It works differently with everyone. Some have to take it with a meal, some are just fine after a couple of weeks, or others are fine until they eat something they aren\\'t suppose to eat!\\n\\nIf the loose bowel movements and stomach aches don\\'t go away after 1-3 months, depending on how serious, I would contact your Dr. back! I finally couldn\\'t take it anymore after 7 months so my Dr. (regular PCP) switched me to 2,000mg/day of Fortamet, which is the extended-release form of Metformin & I had no side effects on that. (it was also for my Diabetes, which I was newly diagnosed) It can take a few months for the Metformin to really start working so just keep an eye on it and if things don\\'t fix, talk with your Dr. about it.\\nI am only taking one 500mg ER tablet a day, so my situation may be different.\\n\\nI take it at night with a glass of milk. I sleep off most of the sideeffects. and te bm\\'s for me never really got any better.\\n\\nI was on 1000mg ER for a while and I took it at night also.\\nYeah, I tried taking them late at night right before bed but I\\'d wake up early in the morning & get really sick to my stomach. I could never sleep away the side effects.\\n\\nThey say Metformin can take 1-3 months before it starts really working so she needs to give it a little time, and then discuss the problems with her Dr. if anything worsens! I hated that feeling, I can imagine she does too!!\\nthanks for the feedback..Its been a week tomorrow and the loose bm isn\\'t as bad now but there are stomach cramps and loss of appetite..I\\'m following my docs diet plans and started exercising again so I am noticing weight loss which is very exciting for me!!

I have just taken my first dose of Met today with just one a day for a week, then two a day for a week then up to 3 a day from then on.  I wasn\\'t told anything about what not to eat. so any advice would be great please.\\nMy daughter, 22, was just diagnosed with PCOS in August. She was put on birth control pills by gyn and prescribed the metformin by her regular dr. The dr told her to take with each meal starting with 1/2 pill. She has not been able to tolerate even the 1/2 pill. The stomach cramps and diarrahea were severe so she stopped taking it. Saw her dr who was mad that she did that. She checks her glucose level after meals and it has never been in the \"high\" range. Does anyone know if the metformin is really neccessary for the type II diabetes if she\\'s on birth control pills for the PCOS? Any advise would be appreciated.\\nJB\\nWell today is my 2nd day of metformin and I have had a nasty tummy all day today. I\\'m only on 1 tablet at the moment.  Its a scary thought to think that I would be on 3 tablets a day in 3 weeks time.  Oh hope this settles down quickly.\\nHi,\\n\\nMy Doctor started me on 500 mg twice a day of the Metformin..he said to move up slowly until I could tolerate the 1000 mg twice a day........I do take it with food..........it has taken me over a month to get the dose he wanted.\\n\\nMy upset stomach and diarrhea and HUNGER has stopped.. but on occasion it will flare up.........it is rare now after 4 weeks.........I hope you have success with it.......\\n\\nOleander\\nWhen do you start to see the weight come off? I just started taking 500 mg once a day. Is that to little of an amount to see any weight loss? Should I ask my doctor to increase it?\\nI was diagnosed with PCOS a couple of years ago as I was only having 3-4 periods in an entire year...my doc put me on Metformin 500 mg twice daily, once in the morning, once in the evening...I never had any stomach problems or any other problems...I started having a period every 28 days and ovulating normally again - thank goodness for this drug!!  I believe it also aided somewhat in my losing over 100 pounds in the last 2.5 years...along with eating right and exercising...but at least now I feel like a woman again, having regular periods...I know it sounds funny, who WANTS to have one, but really...I\\'m glad now.\\nI started taking Metformin nearly 3 months ago.  I had some abdominal pain at first, and the occasional loose BM, but nearly no side effects now.

When I try to take it with a snack (example: piece of fruit) or with spicy food is when I get some of the side effects back.\\n\\nthe glucophage has helped reduce my appetite TREMENDOUSLY.  I was worried about trying it this time (I had tried it a few years back, the dr put me on 1500mg a day right away, and I reacted horribly) but it\\'s been great.  I\\'ve lost 15lbs since I started taking the medication, which amazes me since I\\'ve actually had to decrease my exercise level by over 50% lately (too much work)--so it really has to be diet/medication.  I can\\'t wait to see what happens when I get time to work out regularly again.\\n\\nI did start seeing weight loss on about my 6th or 7th day of taking the medication.  However, I\\'ve heard that you need to be on at least 1000-1500mg a day to see results.  I\\'m not sure why I saw results so early.....\\n\\nAnyways, I hope this helps!',\n",

       " {'post': 'After reading some of your posts, I thought I would share my story. I was diagnosed with PCOS after my hubby and I were trying to get pregnant and couldn\\'t. We knew he was okay because he has 2 kiddos from a previous marriage.  That was back in 2001, my gyno did an ultrasound and sure enough there were those pesky cysts. I have always gotten cysts easily anyway. When I would actually have my cycle or ovulate I would cramp so bad because of the cysts. My gyno gave me a prescription for Clomide and gave me directions. I took 2 pills then threw them away, feeling as though I was taking it back out of God\\'s hands. Three months later I got pregnant without any medication. I had no problems with the pregnancy at all and I delivered a healthy baby boy, who is now 6 years old. I will say that after having my 6 year old I had an ultrasound done and there were no cysts! It took my body a full year before I got my cycles back and there were no more cramps.\\n\\nWe always wanted to have at least another child and tried without any medication for 4 years with no luck. Finally I talked to my hubby and we decided to see a gyno. Well, the gyno that I was referred to through a good friend, just happened to be a specialist in PCOS and the best in Colorado Springs. He started out by explaining how PCOS works and how it affects me. He then told me to cut down my carbs to 60 a day\\nand to eat as much protein as possible. Then he had me get this protein powder to make drinks with that was terrible tasting (and I did not do it yucko), gave me glucaphoge and finally he gave me medicine to help me start my cycle - I can\\'t remember what it was called. So I did this, I came back after a couple of weeks and he weighed me and was alarmed that I had lost 8 lbs. I told him, \"Doc you took all my carbs away, what did you expect!\" After taking the Clomide, I was pregnant immediately. From the first visit to the pregnancy visit it was only 1 month. I do have to say that it is nice not having to worry about birth control methods, since it takes a great deal for me to get pregnant, but it is not too much that it is not impossible.\\n\\nI hope that my story encourages someone out there, there is hope, and it really helps when you can find a PCOS specialist.\\nI appreciate you posting your success story. Stories like that is what helps many of us to continue TTC and/or \"fixing\" our bodies or helping the PCOS symptoms!\\n\\nOur RE\\'s told us I probably had PCOS my entire life but I got pregnant the first time without a problem, which resulted in an ectopic a few years back. I am hoping we\\'re pregnant now (OB appointment tomorrow) but if not, I am being VERY demanding & clear at our goals & if I have to, I will be switching Dr\\'s. They want to be jumpy with the Clomid, not bother with prescribing something different like the Femara, and I am TIRED of being told to take different types of meds. I shouldn\\'t have to live my entire life or reproductive years on medication - I refuse to take it. I did for 7 months, kept me sick and didn\\'t fix a thing!\\n\\nGood luck with TTC if you continue to have more children. I hope the rest of you out there suffering from PCOS are lucky to have children, too and to go on having normal lives! People act like you can just \"fix\" or help PCOS but they have NOOO idea what kind of emotional distress it causes, not to mention the stress on your body & mentality in your relationships/marriages. I have crying fits/anger fits at times & my husband has trouble helping me because he just doesn\\'t get it sometimes! I recommend finding a support group and/or standing up for what you want, set your goals, etc. I\\'ve seen PLENTY of overweight (I am not overweight) women conceive; heavier than MOST PCOS patients so why just b/c you have PCOS it causes Infertility? Crock of crap! I sometimes wonder if ANY of these Dr\\'s know what the heck they are talking about, LOL!\\n\\nSorry it turned into a rant, haha. Good luck all\\nI\\'ll keep ya\\'ll in my prayers!\\n\\nI was just wondering, are you overweight, and if so..... is it just a little bit, or very overweight.  I am just curious because I am very very overweight. I will tell you I am 5\\'6\"  and I am probably about 150-180lbs overweight. That is all I can tell you. LOL  But I am just curious to see if it\\'s the ones that aren\\'t so much overweight that concieve a tiny bit easier.\\ni was diagnosed with PCOS last week. am confused. i realy dont wat to think of it tho\\' my doc is doin a follow up... i jus hop i can get babies.......

Although I've lost weight he wants me to continue to eat healthy and exercise.   You might want to do the BBT just to see if you are ovulating and also you want to be on a healthy weight.

I would say to go back to your doctor if nothing happens in 6 months.\\n\\nGood luck to you and lost of baby powder.\\nyour doctor may go ahead and increase the dosage if there are no results. But you must have patience during this time. I have been on the medication for a year and still no baby. I recently joined curves and I have lost a few pounds since joining but not enough for me.

I was told by the doctor the next time that happens and I run a fever to go to the er.  Thanks for the reply!\\n\",\n",

Usually when my cycles are fairly normal I only break out for about the week before my period, but this time I broke out for about 5 weeks.\\n\\nDoes this sound like PCOS to anyone?\\nEveryone is different, some people have labs come back abnormal but not many cysts or any cysts on their ovaries.  Others (like me) have normal labs but multiple cysts on both ovaries and most of the symptoms.\\n\\nUsually however for it to be PCOS you will have many different symptoms.  Some of those are:\\nThere are other things that can cause similar symptoms, mainly hypothyroidism.  Good luck!\\nI had never heard abdominal, flank and lower back pain being caused by PCOS. If that is the case, maybe I am not getting the pain from the kidney stones like i thought. Lately I have been having a lot of pelvic pain, abdominal pain, lower back pain, and flank pain on both sides, and the doctors have been debating whether it was my kidney stones causing it (as the kidney stones are still in the kidneys on both sides). I have PCOS, and have for about 2 years. My periods are so painful. I just want to cry all of the time.\\nI would ask the doctor to test you with lab results that show PCOS. I can't remember what they are. PCOS also causes some people to have impaired glucose tolerance. I ended up getting diabetes. Birth control can help with some of the symptoms. Maybe you should try that. It doesn't seem to be helping my pain though.\\nSorry that I can't offer much help. Hope it starts getting better.\\nDaisy\",\n",

       " {'post': \"Yesterday I had a water sono done and the doctor and tech were talking pretty much in dr lingo to each other and they were looking at the montitor and said it is classic POS.... I asked what that was and they said I am not ovulating monthly. I have been so devasted ever since. Just writing this I am in tears\\nI am supposed to be going in for an IUI in the next couple of months without medications. The only reason this sono was done was because they were ruling out fibroids they though they saw on the vaginal sono. I have been researching online all over the place on info. I just got medical clearance to have a baby due to a heart condition. That is now stable thank God. Not only is this PCOS the only problem but last week they called me after the results of my blood work and said my thyroid was elevated for a reproductive procedure. They said it would be in normal range per an endocranoligist.But as for my IUI they said it could prevent me from getting pregnant. So now I am on a new medication for that. I don't know how much more I can take. I was suppose to start my first IUI this week and now it is on hold due to the thyroid problem. Now who knows how much longer it will be. I called the nurse at the reproductive doctor and she told me to start checking for ovulation with the kit yesterday, so I did and nothing\\nI have to keep checking everyday now until I get a surge and then a week later go in for some blood test to check my progestrine (sp?) level to see if I actually ovulated or not. I also called my gyn back to make a follow up appointment with her, so lucky enough they had a cancelation for tomorrow. I need to be told what this is, how is it treated, how did I get it....etc I loooked at the symptoms online and none of them really apply except for the weight gain and the inability to lose no matter how much dieting and exercise I do. My periods come ever month sometimes a couple of days late and last about 5 days now instead of 6. And the only other thing I can think of is I do have ovarian cysts but they are small. According to the web this is very serious and can lead to some pretty bad stuff. The only other thing that I now have which I don't know is related is elevated tryglycerides which I have never had. Can anyone here please tell me what to expect from this and could I have been misdiagnosed? Any feedback will greatly be appreciated as I am going crazy and don't know where else to turn.\\nThanks very much!\\ni have been also diagnosed with pcos, at first i knew that something was wrong because i wasn't having periods and i have a lot of facial hair. I was scared to go to the doctor because i was in denial. Finally i went, because of my mother and i was in constant pain. I went to 2 different doctors at 2 different hospitals and both said I have PCOS. I was devastated but now that i am learning more about it, i want to help someone just like someone helped me. I read about it constantly. Basically if you take care of yourself, you have nothing to worry about. I go to the doctor to have regular check-ups. Its not like you are dying. Why did it have to happen to us. I often ask myself, what did I do to God, that I am not able to have children. I have a period once a year if that. I have to constantly use Nair so people want see my facial hair. No matter what i do, i can't seem to loose weight. I just know that it could be worse for you and I, but thank God that its not. Whatever we have to do to overcome this, we will. Don't let one doctor determine what you have, go see another. GO to any search engine and type in ENDOCRINOLOGIST...then look for doctors in your area or close by then scroll down and make sure that PCOS is showing in the appropiate box...it will give you the name, number, and address of PCOS specialist...Wish you much luck...\\nWE ALL WILL GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER!!!!\\nEeyore I also have PCOS was diagnosed when I was 17 and told I may never be able to have a baby. At the time I was devastated also but the more I learned about it and the older I got the more I realized I could do something to have a baby. I did three IUI/injectable cycles which all failed also took Metformin, which is a diabetic medicine, they give it to lots of PCOS patients to help them conceive. I was ready to start looking at adoption and my RE recommended IVF which I didn't have the money for at the time so we decided to wait until Spring(last IUI was in July) to try IVF. And the in November I had the flu and when I went to the DR he asked could you be preggo (because I was seveeral weeks late, last period was Sept 17th) and I said no way and explained. He said well I'm going to perscribe safe meds just in case and I went on my way. A few days later I wanted to take some Nyquil and DH says well maybe you should test first just to be safe. So I took a HPT and it was positive. I said alll of this to let you know it doesn't mean you can't get preggo it may just be a little more difficult. I am now ttc #2 through IVF.

Have only been on it for eight weeks but now look better and feel better as I have a Metabolic Disorder I now have been trying coconut oil and in a week have seen results. Don't give up I know what its like feeling that you will never move the weight. So hang in there.\\nHave you been to a Endocrine Doctor?\\nHEY, Ive seen plenty endocrinologists...... yes im also on metformin. Just started it again. was on 500mgs for 6 weeks now im taken 1000 mgs the past 2weeks i dont see any changes and still no period the past 8 months. No i am not pregnant they tested me like 6 times already these past 8months all negative. I did have high testerone levels the endo said. I am really worried that i havent gotten my period in this long. it is not like me. i usually go like 3 months without it thats it. never this long you know. i need help. i do eat real well and excersise and im on metformin and synthroid no results. what is this cocount oil you taking? what is that?\\nI have the same issue.  I had an endocrinologist literally laugh in my face when I told him what I ate and how much I was exercising.  I also have high testosterone (last test was 101 ng/dl).  Gynos and endos just pat you on the head (verbally) and tell you to try harder- they are useless (I still get my annual pap though).  One of my coworkers suggested going to a nutritionists to see if they believe me.   I'm not insulin resistant though, my fasting insulin and glucose have always been normal.  Although 2 of my mom's siblings are morbidly obese (my dad's half sister was before having gastric bypass) and still don't have diabetes in their 50's so I'm hoping if I'm better with diet and exercise I'll avoid it.\\n\\nI'm not the OP but I have coconut oil I got from an Asian market.  I cook with it sometimes but don't take it daily.  It shouldn't be that hard to find unless you live in the middle of nowhere.\\nI have PCOS but my labs always show normal including my insulin levels and glucose.  I've been on Metformin for 3 months and have lost 17lbs.  I eat sensibly and before the Metformin I couldn't even lose a single pound.\\n\\nYou might want to look into Metformin and/or a glycemic index diet.\\n\\nGood luck!\\nI have been doing a low GI for about 10 years (the first few low carb) and nothing.  I did take a break from that and try the McDougal (sp?) program for maximum weight loss, an extremely low fat vegan diet.  I had no idea a person could gain almost 20 lbs in 3 weeks until trying that and I didn't even eat potatoes like it says you can.  I lost 10 of it in about 18 months but the rest is still here (2 years later).  I'm actually glad it didn't work since extremely low fat food is disgusting no matter how much spice you add.\\n\\nI think I'll go with a nutritionist once I'm done with physical therapy for my back since I'm doing that 3X a week.  That person might be more interested in doing something like Met, every doctor I've seen assumes I'm lying and actually sitting around eating burgers and fries and candy bars all day.  I'm not sure if nutritionists are MDs and can write an Rx or not.\\nHave you ever had an U/S to check your ovaries for cysts?\\nNope I was diagnosed based on symptoms.  Irregular periods, severe cystic acne (not since accutane though), depression, and later was found to have high testosterone levels.  After learning more about PCOS I'm surprised no one ever did that.\\n\\nI'll try to make this story as short as possible:  Started taking pamelor at 15 for depression (after 3 years of therapy), gained 15 lbs in 6 weeks, another 20 over the next year or so after eating better and exercising.  Periods went from about every other month to occasional. Then the constant bleeding (for up to 3 months at a time or as short as 2 weeks) that was not helped for more than a couple months or made worse by BCPs started and continued for about 8 years until I was tapered off the pamelor at 31 (now 33).  I'm not regular but after 2 years off the pamelor I no longer bleed for months, instead I just have about 3-5 a year but I have not lost the weight I gained despite increased vigilance with diet and exercise.  Lately my appetite has decreased significantly (I'm just not hungry) but zero weight loss.\\nI also started smoking at 14 and today is my quit day (hopefully for real this time).\\n\\nGood thing I don't like children since I probably couldn't have them if I tried (I'd need a sex drive for that too\\n.)\\n\\nEdit- I went to the doc for the appetite loss and fullness.  Since my last pap was December and my chems and CBCs were normal she did not have any recommendation.\\nI would seriously push for an U/S.  All of my labs are ALWAYS normal, the only thing that shows abnormal are the U/S's of my ovaries.  I have all of the symptoms for the most part.\\n\\nHonestly, if you're Dr's are not helping you and are dismissing your symptoms as well as your abnormal labs I would try to find someone who will listen to you.\\n\\n((hugs))\\nI've been trying to find someone who will listen for 10 years (that would be about 4 gynos over that time).  I guess I have to keep on trying.\\n\\nHi Liz\\n,\\n\\nYou answered one of my threads on the weight issue. Thank You it is good to know there are people out there with the same story as me. I have just joined another diet scheme run by the health service. What they do is balance your food groups. I'm 118kg (18 stone 9 pounds) and what she recomended for me is 10 portions of fruit and veg (max 3 fruit a day), 7 portions of Starchy food (bread, pasta, potatoes), 5 portions of Dairy, 6 portions of Protein, 2 portions of Fats & Sugars & drink 2 litres of water a day. Exercise 30 mins 4 to 5 times a week.\\nI hope that this may be of help for you or anybody else struggling. I have'nt started till monday so I will let you know if it works for me, but it could be worth a try. If you want anymore info contact me.\\n\\nHi morrisun,\\nI have the same labs as you and tried metformin a couple of years ago, it did'nt work for me then. I was doing a low fat low carb diet at the time. Is there any diet ideas you can give me to help if I was to try Metformin again. I have been given a new diet plan which is below do you think it may work with this plan?\\nChris\\nThe only thing I know that helps me is to stay away from greasy, fatty foods when you're on Metformin.  My Endo just prescribed the name brand Fortamet because he said it sometimes doesn't cause the s/e's as the Metformin.  I haven't had it filled yet though so I can't say if it helps.  Good luck!\\n\\nThat sounds similar to someting I've tried before.  I think I'm going to see a nutritionist in August.  My PT should be done and I'll have been smoke free for about a month (hopefully).  But if that doesn't work and what you're doing works for you I'll get some details.\\n\",\n",

He did the blood work and then referred me to an endocrinologist.  The man was very rude and told me that my only problem was that I am fat and need to have Gastric by-pass surgery and on and on.  Then he said he would do his exam, expecting to find nothing, and send me home.  He ended up giving me the most rough breast exam I have ever had in my life.  I have never been to this type of Dr. before and didn't know what to expect, also I didn't eat before the visit because they were going to do more blood work (my blood sugar dropped), I left the office crying and thought of driving myself into the river on the way home.  I talked with my OB about the visit and he was very upset.  I later filed a complaint against him, but that doesn't help the issues I am having now.  I am afraid to go to another doctor, I feel like the fattest most horrible person in the world, I think sometimes about killing myself.  My children and husband are the only things keeping me here.  I thought that I could deal with this by myself, not even talking to my husband about the problems.  I feel emotionally destroyed.  This has eaten away at me inside and I don't know what to do about it now.  I feel like I can't go to anyone for help.  My husband is a pastor and I don't want to bother him all the time with my issues, and can't talk to anyone else because of fear of gossip.  I am just against a brick wall right now and I don't know what to do.  Can anyone help?\\nI am so sorry the RE treated you that way. You were in the right by filing a complaint against him. I would not return to that Dr. and would definitely ask for a referral for another RE! I hope you find someone that's better.\\n\\nI also have PCOS & am young, and haven't been treated that way in the year we've been seeing specialists. When I gained a little weight they were very upfront with me but just never in a rude way. Losing weight & eating healthy does help results in PCOS patients, and increases your chances of conceiving with or without the help of medication! I'm sure you already know that.\\n\\nEither way, I would recommend speaking with your Dr. about another referral to someone else. I hope you are able to find a good Dr and find a way to get through all of this! (( Hugs ))\\n\\nSorry if I am not much help. But, you were treated wrong & I wouldn't let that go.

I had very irregular cycles after the pill, some as long as 60 days. I tried to conceive for a few months, then went to my OB-GYN who happened to be a fertility specialist. He said I most likely had some anovulatory cycles and put me on Clomid. I conceived the second month. No problem with my pregnancy, but I never did produce enough milk. I tried nursing all the time, then I would nurse and pump after every nursing, never increased my milk production.\\n\\nI tried to concieve almost two years after the birth of my first, but had the same problems. Again tried clomid for two months, didn't get pregnant, but the month after I did (no clomid). The doctor assured me I wouldn't be low in breast milk again, but I was. I went to a lactation consultant who put me on a strict nursing regimen, but it didn't help. Then she had me take Fenugreek which is supposed to up milk supply, still didn't help. I just nursed and supplemented with formula.\\n\\nMy youngest is 6 now. Now for the current problems.\\nFor the past 1 1/2 years I've been to numerous doctors about this right sided abdominal, pelvic, flank and lower back pain and pressure. It comes and goes, and has lasted as long as 3 months solid, and has been gone for as long as 2 months. At first they did nothing, then I've had normal abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds (over a year ago though). ONe doc said I may have kidney stones, one said IBS, OB-GYN said possibly endometriosis, and put me on the pill, which I quit after 2 cycles because I hated it. My GP is convinced I have IBS and has referred me to a GI specialist. The referral was in January, and I hadn't received an apt. yet as of May so I finally called. I had a June apt. I had to cancel. Now my apt is in August.\\n\\nNow my last period started May 14. On cd's 26 through 29 (4 full days) I had light spotting. I kept thinking my period was going to start, but it didnt. I rarely have 28 day cycles, usually range 29 to 35. I started Sunday on day 49.  I e-mailed my new OB_GYN about the 4 days of spotting on day 31, and he said in your 30's the longer cycles can be normal, but everything I've read is contrary to that. He also told me to see the GI doctor, and if it came up with nothing, to come back to him and he may do a lap. He kind of ignored the whole spotting thing. I also have been broken out for 4 weeks, and usually only am about a week before my period, and a couple days when I ovulate.\\n\\nI don't know what to do. I'm so afraid I have ovarian cancer or uterine, but know it could be PCOS, endometriosis or fibroids or ovarian cysts. It could even be a pituitary tumor. I don't want to be fearful or pushy for no reason, especially cause I've been to numerous docs in the past 1 1/2 years about my pain/pressure.\\n\\nList of current symptoms:\\n\\nStarted on day 49 of cycle\\npassed golf ball size blood clot on cd2\\nLight spotting for 4 days on days 26 to 29\\nRight sided abdominal, flank, pelvic and lower back pain/pressure\\nAbdominal pressure and fullness\\nBowel irregularities (diarrhea/constipation)\\nOccasional irritated feeling in bladder\\nWeight gain 10 pounds since January (5 from the pill though).\\nI forgot to add, I've struggled with my weight up and down my whole life.

       " {'post': 'Hi there,\\nI was told by a fertility doc that my thyroid levels were off. They said in a range that was .40-4, I had a 4.6 and I was a little high, I guess meaning hypothyroidism. They wanted me to go on Synthroid. Now, 2 months later (without going on the drug), I checked my blood again with another doc, he tells me I don\\'t have a thyroid issue and in fact my levels are perfect, at 2.4, whatever that means.\\nHe did an exam and suggested I might have PCOS because my ovaries were \"plump\" and I have other symptoms like long cycles, abnormal bleeding, etc...I guess I do have some of the symptoms but none of them are extreme..a little hair in undesirable places, difficulty losing weight (though I\\'m probably only 10 pounds overweight)....\\nSo now I\\'m just confused. Did I have a thyroid issue and now I don\\'t and all along I\\'ve had PCOS? I\\'m going to yet another doc for another opinion.\\nBut if it is PCOS, how do you procede if you don\\'t have diagnosed cysts? My diet is really healthy, I exercise, I take care of myself....what else is there, aside from taking Clomid for ovulation?\\nAny thoughts would be appreciated.\\nThanks,\\nL\\nHi! Do not worry, just because you have PCOS doesn\\'t mean your life is over or that you cannot conceive. It very well can happen. (easier said than done sometimes, lol)\\n\\nAnyways, I am not sure what that means in regards to your thyroid. When I had those tests done, mine came back perfect. I was diagnosed with PCOS in August (2006). Most Dr\\'s will prescribe Metformin for PCOS patients & Clomid to help with ovulation, but in my case the first 2 rounds of Clomid I did would not work and the Metformin only made me sick.\\n\\nEither way, with people having problems with irregular periods & Clomid not working (not sure if you\\'ve tried it yet or not?), they normally recommend the next step to Injectable, IUI, and/or IVF. But, in many PCOS cases, there have been MANY BFP\\'s with or without the medication as well. It really depends on any other health problems or how fast/far your Dr. is willing to go. The steps after Clomid get very costly, too, just to prepare you. I\\'m sure you\\'ve researched all of this, though!\\n\\nGood luck to you & I probably wasn\\'t much help but I wanted to offer encouragement. I find it very hard sometimes to listen to my own words but just know it can happen, it will happen, and just hang in there\\n\\n\\nhi Laf\\nI definately understand where you are coming from...I was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid 3 years ago, shortly after having my son...and we\\'ve been trying for #2 for about 2 years with no luck..I take levothyroxine for my thyroid and I believe one of the reasons thyroids effect fertility is because of hormones...anyway about a month ago I was also diagnosed with PCOS via ultrasound and blood test...I believe to be diagnosed with PCOS the blood test needs to show insulin resistance...so if you have only had an ultrasound, I would ask for a blood test, if that hasn\\'t been done already...It definately seems like you have all the symptoms for it...and some of the symptoms of underactive thyroid are the same as PCOS...\\nMy doctor put me on a low carb diet and I am taking metformin...She told me once we start treating the PCOS, pregnancy will most likely follow soon....\\nGood luck with everything and I hope I was helpful..if you have any questions feel free to ask me..\\nI forgot to mention that I had an HSG done where they shoot the dye through your tubes to check for blockages, etc. Although my tubes were clean & clear, the X-Ray images they took during that procedure were clear that I had PCOS due to cysts blocking my ovaries from releasing eggs!\\n\\nEither way, I would definitely recommend further blood work and possibly the same procedure I had done. It tells a lot and can help your Dr\\'s further assist you!\\n\\nGood luck!\\nThanks Kris and Miriam for your responses.\\nI actually haven\\'t had any tests done except for blood (no insulin), no ultrasound, etc.\\nMy doc just did a regular exam and said my ovaries felt enlarged.\\nHaven\\'t done an HSG yet either.  I\\'m going to a fertility clinic on Friday so I assume they\\'ll suggest all these tests.\\nJust curious, did either of you have serious obvious symptoms or was it just a fertility issue?\\nLike I mentioned, I have super long cycles and abnormal bleeding, but as far as the weight, excess hair, etc...it seems pretty minor, and I think the hair, in my case is heredity.  My sister and mom both have excess facial and stomach hair and we all have the same body type.  Not \"fat\" but we are all always trying to lose 5-10 pounds (who isn\\'t?).\\nAnyway, just curious if there were major signs before being diagnosed.\\nThanks!!\\nLaf ~ I didn\\'t have obvious symptoms of PCOS as I don\\'t have a problem with excess body hair & never had a weight problem growing up or as a young adult. (I\\'m almost 23 now) I am trying to lose now because I gained unwanted weight due to seeking help for the disorder.\\n\\nAnyways, my husband and I are trying to conceive our first child. I had an ectopic and then miscarried around 3-3 1/2 months, therefore placing me as \"Secondary Infertility\". We decided to start seeing an Infertility Specialist July, 2006, because I went an entire year without a period. They ran all of the tests first - blood work, fasting 3 hour glucose test (which showed insulin resistance), HSG, pap smear & breast exam of course (I was due for one anyways),  and a few other things. After the HSG (was painful for me), at our next appointment they showed & said I had multiple cysts blocking my ovaries, which therefore any eggs could not be released. I was put on 2,000mg of Metformin (which helps in PCOS patients), and I stayed very sick on it. I did my first round of Clomid (50mg) in 2006, which didn\\'t work. I did a 2nd round at 100mg, and that didn\\'t do anything for me either. Both periods were induced using Provera, by the way.\\n\\nWell, at our next appointment in April we discussed another procedure, which I had done July 2nd - Endometrial Biopsy to check for Uterine Cancer (since I have yet to get a period since December, too) & to see if my uterus could even sustain a pregnancy. Monday, July 23rd, is our next appointment to get those results & if everything came back okay, I\\'ll start my next round of Clomid (150mg). If that doesn\\'t work, we\\'ll be pushed on to try IUI, injectables, IVF, etc. BUT, I will request more than 1 round of 150mg of Clomid even if this next round doesn\\'t work since I started a new diet plan, and your chances increase when you exercise & eat right.

Either way, sorry for the novel but I wanted to kind of map out how our process has gone.

The med helped with a little weight loss then about a year ago we started trying for #2 and were having no luck..My period would never come and the next month it would be horrible..plus I was having bad pms and still a hard time losing weight..I saw my obgyn last year and we discussed options for getting preggo like taking clomid..My husband and I weren\\'t ready for that move yet..so about a month ago I was having horrible back and pelvis pain and a few days later I felt a horrible ripping sensation on my right ovary..so I called my obgyn and had an ultrasound done which showed I ruptured a cyst on my ovary..ouch..anyway she had some bloodwork done to verify the pcos and that\\'s about where I am today..I started taking metformin on Monday, which is a common drug used to treat pcos and my obgyb says once the pcos is treated pregnancy should happen...anyway my symptoms were there for a while but I thought it was my underactive thyroid; bad or no periods, difficulty losing weight, infertility...Luckily I don\\'t have the facial hair..\\nI hope I was helpful.\\ngood luck\\nThanks Miriam!!\\nI hope they are okay, too so I can go onto my next round of Clomid & pray it works!\\nThanks so much to both of your for these really helpful replies!  This is so new to me-I guess I was silly and thought I could just, well, get pregnant and have a baby!  Little did I know....\\nGood luck to you both and I\\'ll keep you posted if anything interetsing happens at my appointment tomorrow.\\n-Lauren\\nThanks Lauren! I hope you will keep us posted & I hope everything goes great at your appointment. Don\\'t be scared - it gets you closer to holding a little miracle child\\n\\nHI Lauren..\\n\\nWow you were given a lot of news at that appointment..prayers and baby dust coming your way..I take the generic synthroid and and for my pcos I take metformin..it\\'s a little strange your doctor didn\\'t talk much about treatment..but since you are trying to concieve clomid is deinfately the right med especially with the pcos..I have the book \"Understanding adn reversing PCOS\" by Dr. walter futterweit..I recommend it..it has been very helpful for me..\\ngood luck to you\\nThanks Miriam\\nHe is putting me on Synthroid so I\\'ll go on that for sure..and yes I agree it is strange that he didn\\'t talk about meds for the PCOS.  Maybe he doesn\\'t think it\\'s that bad?  He\\'s very much a fertility doc so his mind is on getting me pregnant, obviously, but at this point I don\\'t even feel great about that because of this hormone imbalance and now these uterine polyps...doesn\\'t seem like the best environment for carrying a baby but what do I know?  He seems to think a woman can conceive with all this stuff and even without removing polyps but I have a feeling I will have to get them removed.\\nAs for Clomid, it\\'s not even a possibility at the moment because I still haven\\'t gotten my period (on day 44)....we\\'ll see....lots of stuff to deal with..\\nHope you are doing ok as well.\\n-Lauren',\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi everyone,\\n\\nIt's nice to find message boards about PCOS and Metformin.\\n\\nI started Metformin just over 3 weeks ago. I had alot of blood tests before hand and the results came back that I had PCOS and I had very high levels of male hormone. That explains why I get so hairy where i'm not suppose to.\\n\\nI also recently had a ultrasound on my thyroid and my groiter is very large. My doctor said it's nothing to do with my hormones, so why it is in the same place as the thyroid? I have had to fight to have an operation to have this taken out. I am now waiting to hear from the hospital for an appointment to see a surgeon. I must admit I am petrified, but it must be sorted as it's causing me problems breathing etc.\\n\\nI am also taking Phentermine to help lose weight which I started taking nearly two months ago, and I have already lost a stone and a half. I weighed in at 20.10 1/2 stone. I tried all the diets under the sun, even the Cambridge diet. I lost two stone in a month on that, but as soon as I stopped I put all the weight back on. I found it strange how i've never been 21 stone ever. I have just stayed at 20 stone.\\n\\nI have noticed the past couple of days that my pants are always wet and I am getting a white discharge. It has got me worried, does anyone know what this could be?\\n\\nAlso my last period was last November. And even with the weight I have lost so far, I still haven't bled. I thought losing the weight and being on Metformin I would start to have the cycles back.\\n\\nMy doctor said when she first prescribed Metformin, that if I fell pregnant to stop taking Metformin straight away. I did say to her how can I fall pregnant if i'm not bleeding. Apparently she said even if you don't bleed you can still fall pregnant???\\n\\nI am confused on some bits regarding all this. I hope someone could clarify things for me.\\n\\nMany thanks\\n\\nAmethyst71 xx\\nI started PMT last saturday for the first time in 5 months. And my god it's been really bad, in so much pain with it. I was expecting it to be bad tho.\\n\\nI am now wondering becuase my periods have come back, will l be able to fall pregnant?\\n\\nI am still dieting even tho I want to eat everything chocolate because of pmt.\\n\\nl have a hospital appointment on 8th June to see a surgeon about my operation to have my Goiter taken out. I am more petrified now than l was waiting for the letter to arrive. And what makes it worse is l will have to quit smoking because l don't want to risk damaging my throat coughing because l have a smokers cough.\\nWhat's PMT??\\n\\nGood luck with the surgery, I know that's always scary. But I'm sure you'll be fine.\\n\\nI can't believe you have the willpower to diet. I am awful at dieting. I can't make it past one day eating right. Good on you for the diet!\\nWe call periods PMT in uk lol.\\n\\nI had to diet, because it was causing me problems with trying to conceive.\\n\\nAnd because I am now 36 yrs old, my time is running out to give my husband a child of his own which he doesn't have. I got it into my head that having a baby is more important than being over weight. I have now lost 28 lbs. But with the help of Metformin, Adios, Phentermine which cuts my appetite down. I have cut out all the junk food and just eat sensibly.\\nHi Amethyst,\\n\\nPlease be careful taking phenteramine.  Have you read the book 'dispensing with the truth' ? it was written by a lawyer overseeing the phen-phen lawsuit.....-- its references phenteramine and my impression was the possible risks are not worth the wieght loss advantage.  Please read up on that- I'm worried about you taking it!!\\nHi,\\n\\nI have been fine on Phetermine. Doc who gives them to me always takes my blood pressure at every weigh in.\\n\\nI have now lost 3 stone in 3 months.\\n\\nSo I had a blood test done a week ago today to see if i am ovulating now my periods are regular. And it's come back that i'm not\\n. I don't understand why tho, i thought it was common knowledge that if you have periods then you are ovulating, and when you don't, then your not.\\n\\nI must admit that has come as a major blow to me. I am losing weight to have a baby, so now i am thinking is there any point in carrying on if i'm never going to ovulate?\\nHi Amethyst,\\n\\nI have dealt with PCOS since my teens, and I'm now 39.  Just because you have periods, even regular ones, does not mean you are ovulating.  What you are experiencing as a period is strictly the sheding of the lining of your uterus.  It's good that you are on Met as it will treat insulin resistance, which is a huge part of PCOS.  Losing weight will help, too, and keeping that insulin low will also keep testosterone low resulting in an easier path to losing weight.\\n\\nI just started Phentermine two weeks ago, and I'm also taking Met.  I'll be curious to hear how your progress goes.\\nI started taking met in 2003, and it regulated my cycles that were often over 180 days long down to 32 days. It then took us an additional 2 years to get pregnant and I had taken 2 months of BCP's to kick start my system.\\n\\nSo, hopefully it will work that way for you too!\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi all!  I\\'m a newbie to this board and am looking forward to hearing (and sharing) PCOS experiences.\\n\\nI\\'m 35 and have been diagnosed with PCOS for about 3 years now.  Looking back, the symptoms were there for at least 5 years before my diagnosis.  At first, my OB/GYN put me on Yasmin b/c at that time, I hadn\\'t had a period in at least 6 months.  She strongly advised I lose weight, which was impossible b/c of my insulin resistance.  It was so easy to gain weight, but all I did was maintain when I\\'d diet and exercise.  I\\'m now married and would like to get pregnant.  I\\'m taking care of the diet and exercise via a personal trainer.  During my annual visit last week, my doctor prescribed Metformin and Progesterone.  The metformin is to be taken with each meal indefinitely and should help my insulin resistance.  The progesterone was to help me get a \"fake period.\"  I took progesterone for 5 days (full prescription).  That ended about 3 days ago.  I was wondering, when should I expect to see my \"fake period\" start?  Should I be concerned that nothing has happened yet?\\n\\nHello! I would think the progesterone would start working fairly quick...and I wouldn\\'t think that once you stopped taking it you\\'d start having a period...I guess since you\\'re finished with your prescription, you could call your doctor and ask them about it?  I know for me, it was the metformin that caused the period, and that was within days after I started taking it.  Goodluck!\\nI took prgesterone a couple of weeks ago, for 5 days, finished on the friday and my fake period started on the monday and finished monday just gone.\\n\\nnot sure what the norm is.\\nI actually showed signs of starting this morning!  I hope this isn\\'t TMI, but it was light this morning and is getting heavier as the day progresses.\\n\\nI was getting concerned that it had been a couple of days with nothing happening.  I guess 3 days may be the norm.  Thanks so much for your replies!  It really helped me to know I wasn\\'t going to be an exception to the progesterone rule!\\n',\n",

Clomid is not as bad as some about doing this but it still can happen.  Also some women on Clomid have very painful and heavy periods as well.

But my family tree is full of auto-immune conditions as well as diabetes so I wasn't surprised.\\n\\nPCOS is a hormonal and metabolic disorder.  PCOS on it's own doesn't cause diabetes, but it can lead to pre-diabetes and if untreated you can develop diabetes.\\n\\nAlso high insulin levels don't cause hirsuitism, it's usually caused by excess androgen hormones.  And PCOS doesn't necessarily cause high insulin levels either.  In some people it does, others (like me) have normal blood sugar.\\n\\nDiabetes depends on genetics and lifestyle.  I'm predisposed to diabetes due to my family history, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to develop it.

       " {'post': \"I was diagnosed with PCOS about 9 years ago. I probably had it longer though. I have always had a weight problem and I kept trying and trying to lose it. I am crying now because I am afraid that I will never be able to lose this weight. Has anyone had success out there. Can you offer any nutrition suggestions? I just saw a doctor for the first time in years to ask for help, she ordered up a bunch of tests for me to take including checking insulin and glucose. I am also going to get my thyroid checked. I am afraid to take birth control because I just want to lose the weight and I think that will complicate my efforts even more. Also does anyone with pcos reading this have a problem with water retention? any suggestions there? Thank you. this is my first time doing this...ever..My doctor suggested I look into a support group.\\nI too had PCOS for many, many years before finally being diagnosed.  I was completely unable to lose weight, I couldn't even lose a stinkin' pound.  Finally I was diagnosed and have been taking Metformin and so far have lost 20lbs, I'm hoping to lose a total of about 40lbs.  If you're interested in trying to lose weight with dieting, you should look into the Glycemic Index diet, there are a few different books out there on it.\\n\\nGood luck!!\\nHello! I am kinda in the same boat as you right now. I just want this damn weight off!  I am ready to get serious about this. After doing a lot of reading, I suppose its all about those darn carbs.  Gotta cut back on them and eat the healthy whole wheat ones.  I don't take the birth control pill for other reasons (ie: it makes me crazy) so i'm not sure what to tell you about that.  I recently started on Aldactone though to help with the hormones and a few side effects. I'm not reallly sure what your blood tests are like, but you could consider talking to your MD about that. Its also a mild diuretic, so it would help with water retention.  Metformin is the other common drug of choice for treating PCOS. I take that to help regulate my cycles without the stress of the BCP making me crazy.  Also, I guess exercise is important in addition to the good-carb diet.  My two favourite things! But, it needs to be done, and in the long run will be worth it.  Let me know what you decide or find out.  I think keeping in touch with someone trying to accomplish the same goals as you could be encouraging!\\n\\n\\nWow, thanks you guys for understanding. I will talk to my MD about the metformin. I'll keep my eye out for books about the glycemic index. I do have another question though. I have really been really depressed lately because of my increased discouragement and I have a long time history of stress in my life. Has any of you experienced this? and if so, Does the medication help with all that too?\\nRee-\\n\\nAre you on Metformin?  I had the same trouble losing weight, even when I was training for a marathon, until I started taking the drug.  Now it's not AS hard to lose weight, but I suppose it's about the same as any non-PCOS person.  Here's what helped me...calculate how many calories you need, subtract 500 calories from that number and count everything you eat.  Lots of whole grains, protein, veggies, and fruit will keep you full, but splurge on your favorite food every now and then so you don't go crazy!  Just splurge in moderation.  :-)\\nHi,\\n\\nI have always had a mild form of PCOs but was able to have 3 children and did not have a weight problem until I started into Premenopause...went from a 7 to 16..... The last 6 years have been a nightmare with my weight, blood pressure, thyroid and elevated triglyerides................I have been on South Beach diet for 12 months which is low glycemic...........I also exercise daily.......everyday is a struggle to keep my weight from going upward. It took 12 months to lose 20 pounds. Had to watch everything I put in my mouth.\\n\\nFinally an Endocrinologist evaluating me for my thyroid checked my Insulin and and my 2 hour was sky high.........I am on Metformin now and am already losing weight.........I can eat a slice of bread without gaining 5 pounds, I am really losing in my stomach and upper back area.......which is awesome.......\\n\\nI am in the 160's right now, in a loose 12...........I am feeling encouraged right now........I am sorry you are frustrated........It was amazing to meet a Dr who knew I was telling the truth about my eating habits and inability to lose weight.\\n\\nThis medication upsets my stomach some but so far so good....... I am on 500 Mg twice a day and he wants me to work up to 1000 twice a day....\\n\\nGood luck..............Oleander\\nOh I so feel your pain.  I was diagnosed about 3 years ago.  Looking back, I've presented symptoms for at least 7-8 years.  When initially diagnosed, my OB/GYN put me on BC pills (Yasmin).  It helped a little.  I was on the South beach diet, which helped me lose nearly 20 lbs.  However the moment I went off, the 20 lbs. came right back on.  Ever since, weight loss was a struggle.  Even after returning to south beach.  It seems like I was dieting just to maintain my weight.  The second I had a refind carb or sugar, I'd gain 5 lbs.\\n\\nMy husband and I are now wanting to have kids, so I really want to take the weight off and not resort to IVF or any other fertility methods.  I'm now on Metformin and am following a low/healthy carb diet with my personal trainer.  So far, it's working!  After 2 weeks on the new regimen I've lost nearly 10 lbs!\\n\\nDefinitely ask your doctor a lot of questions!  If they understand PCOS, they'll provide lots of insight for you.  Hang in there!

I have been battling with it for years.  I go on it and take all I can usually about 6 months and then get off for a while before going back on again.  I talked to my doctor and he says it's all in your diet.  Well while on it for one of the longest stretches yet, I have been playing with my diet and the only thing I figured out is it will always make me sick, even when not eating anything at all.  It totally sucks.\\n\\nIf anyone has any tips, food ideas, or general knowledge about dealing with met at all please help.  I go to see my new doc the end of sept.  He will want me to be going good with the met and possibly start me on clomid as well.  How do I cope with the met so I can handle adding a new prescription without wrecking all havoc on my body?\\nThe only thing that helped me is taking the Metformin ER 500mg in the middle of a meal.  I will literally eat half of my dinner, take the pill then eat the other half.  When I do that, I have NO stomach/bowel troubles.  If I take the pill before or after a meal, I will have a lot of trouble and if I take it on an empty stomach, I end up in the ER for dehydration.\\n\\nThe bad part about having to take it in the middle of a meal is I often forget to take it.\\n\\nGood Luck!\\nI am on Metformin ER 500 mg twice a day. ..I am supposed to be moving upward to 4 a day........ I have had some stomach distress but it is improving.\\n\\nI have noticed I can finally eat normally without gaining weight.....It is awesome !!!! I can actually eat bread and few carbs now......it is like heaven......before I was living on protein.\\n\\nOne side effect I have had is hunger........probably dropping my blood sugar since I am on it for Insulin resistance......I seem to want to eat all the time now which is not normal for me......I am careful to eat non fat  non sugar snacks...... I have lost about 8 pounds without trying............I am thrilled.\\n\\nThe ER has agreed with me........now I am going to start moving upward.... Hope this helps........\\n\\nOleander\",\n",

High blood pressure, risks for diabetes, cancer, more hair growth, infertility..etc. Im going to see my gyno on the 17th. She is the one who diagnosed me with PCOS after blood tests and vaginal ultra sound. I found out that this is something you are born with and doesn't rise til puberty or after. That's why for so many women it goes undiagnosed for so long. Does anyone have the same dilemma as me? I would love to hear from you and know how you are doing. My gyno did tell me that after being on the BCP for a year or so, I could possibly go off of it, and my horomones could stay balanced on their own.\",\n",

I really want to try to have children, but everytime I come off the Yasmine pill and spiro, my symptoms get so bad (especially the scalp pain) so quickly, I go right back to taking them.  I am also on metformin.  It sounds selfish, but I am afraid if I go for months off the pills (the time it takes to get pregnant), then do get pregnant (another 9 months plus breastfeeding), that I will really suffer for a long time.

Thanks so much, I would really like to have a child, but I would also really like to keep my hair and not have my \"beard\" get any worse.\\nJust so you know, my friend who gave birth and is nursing is already back on birth control pills.

I have not been to one, but that\\'s anotehr story as far as insurance. I would say this is a good sign getting to an endo.\\n\\nThey will most likely draw blood to test your homone levels (testosterone, thyroid levels, cholesterol, etc.). A telll-tale sign is slightly elevated testosterone levels. Another thing they may do is schedule an ultrasound of your ovaries. They will be checking for cysts.\\n\\nBut you also said your Dr. already did blood tests. So therefore, I can only assume that something in there sparked their interest. They may send the results over to the endo and have them interpret it further and in more depth.\\n\\nSorry I don\\'t have more info on endo\\'s. I am dealing only with my family practice doctor, who has dealt with PCOS regularly and does the same things with PCOS cases as a gyn or endo would do.\\nThanks for the response.\\nMy doctor did say I had elevated levels of testosterone which was causing all of my wierd hair issues.\\nI wish I knew what other kinds of tests she ran...I tried to get her to elaborate on what was \"abnormal\" about them, b/c that\\'s what she told me on the phone, that they came back abnormal. She just said my levels were a little high.\\n\\nShe didn\\'t do an ultrasound though. To be honest...I really don\\'t want an ultrasound if it\\'s going to be one of those vaginal ones\\nCan they see cysts on your ovaries with regular ultrasounds? I hope so!\\nI have been through testing for PCOS through 3 different drs, one obgyn, and 2 RE\\'s, have had all the blood work and the external and internal ultrasounds. Not a pleasant thing, but it was necessary (at least I was told that at the time) to diagnose the cystic ovaries, which were there on my us. Also, they tried to do an endometrial biopsy, but I had far too much pain with it and the doctor decided not to continue. I am seeing a reproductive Endocrinologist now for the fertility issues that come with PCOS, have been on metformin for about 3 years, and trying to concieve for about 1 1/2 years without any luck, but now he has me on 50 mg of clomid, and I just finished my 5 days of it and hoping for results! This time seeing an RE was much easier because I had 3 years to do research on PCOS and was armed with answers for the questions he asked, rather than just having to take it all in. If you are trying to concieve, I wish you all the best, and I also wish you the best even if you are not. It has been nice to find a place to share with others who have the same issues as I do and to realize I\\'m not alone. This can be a lonely disease sometimes...\\nWhen I went to the endocrinologist, at first they did blood work testing my thyroid, and testosterone, and all kind of other things. After a couple of months, they did a glucose tolerance test to rule out diabetes. Ended up just confirming that I had it. Swell. Anyways, it has been two years since my diagnosis. I am 20 years old. THe worst part was the internal ultrasounds. That was all they ever did for the first year and a half, and then I went to ER, where I had my first external ultrasound. Then I changed GYNs and they use both at the same time in order to see all sides of the ovaries or something. It\\'s not too bad really, just uncomfortable the first few times. They were doing it once a month, but now it is like once every three months. Good luck!! Yeah, the endocrinologist wasn\\'t the one who did the ultrasounds. That was the GYN.\\nMy endocrinologist is a Godsend.  My gyn found a lump on my thyroid and had me get it x-rayed and sent me to an endocrin.  That guy looked at it for 2 seconds and said, oh, nothing...come back if it bugs you.  I went to the gyn again for a check-up and he asked about the nodule on my thyroid...told him that the endocrin said it was nothing and he had me to go another endocrin...who had me biopsied and dx\\'d me with Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma.  All done now...but my endocrin is my angel...seriously.\\n\\nAnyhow, the endocrin doesn\\'t do any \"internal\" procedures other than blood tests and med control.  She\\'s fully aware of what my gyn has me on (BC and 1000 mcg of Metformin) and she has me on my thyroid meds.  We\\'ll be working shortly to TTC.\\n\\nI say, see the endocrin, if possible...because if he/she is good...he/she will definitely help.  Good luck!!\\n\\nI\\'m definitely going to mention a glucose tolerance test to my doctor. Over the past year, even before all of this pcos mess started, I\\'ve had concerns about my blood sugar levels. Now since learning about the connection between pcos and diabetes, I\\'m wondering if this is the whole reason why I\\'ve always felt \"off\". It\\'s like everything that has been wrong with me lately is somehow connected to being a symptom of pcos. I really wish I could get an official diagnosis already so I can get started on some kind of medication and treatment plan.\\n\\nThanks for the advice ladies\\nMy appt isn\\'t until the 15th so if anyone else has some info to share, let me know\\n\\nThat\\'s not a bad idea. I was just recently diagnosed with diabetes as well as PCOS and like you for a few months before I just felt \"off.\" Thankfully though for at least now, my sugar is controlled by metformin. I now have to take 850mg 3 x a day. I was on 500 3 x daily, this change has made my stomach feel like it did when I first started to take metformin, again. I hope for you that you do not have diabetes.\\nIts quite normal to be referred to an endo - are you in England or USA - in England we don\\'t have reproductive endocrinologists which people in the USA are often referred to with PCOS.  I see my endo at regular intervals - when I first saw him I had a full set of tests run - thyroid tests, blood glucose tests, cholesterol, urea and creatinine, inflammation tests and pituitary tests - they like to rule out if you have an underlying cause for your hormonal imbalance - for example a problem with your pit gland which controls most hormone levels in the body.  Mine always come back clear except for the thyroid which is very slightly underactive, and the inflammation which is slightly high.  If you get to see your blood form, common abbreviations: U+E (urea and electrolytes), CBC or FBC (full blood count), TFT (thyroid function test, LFT (liver function test), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate - a mark of inflammation, but generic) - so don\\'t be scared by the amount of letters, most of them are routine.  And yes you can see the cysts on an external ultra, and they don\\'t need to do it very often because the cysts are not dangerous or painful unless they rupture, and are not malignant.  If you are in England you are unlikely to be referred to a gyn or fertility expert until you are trying to conceive or having trouble conceiving.',\n",

But losing all of this blood for this long, should I be worried about other health problems?\\n\\nAnything you can give me would be appreciated!\\nAlright so I saw my Dr. today. I still have not stopped bleeding. He gave me a month of birth control pills. I\\'m supposed to take 2 pills a day until my bleeding stops, and then take one a day until the pack is out.\\n\\nIs this odd? I haven\\'t heard of this before. I\\'m willing to do ANYTHING to stop the bleeding. But we also really want a baby.\\n\\nHe mentioned after we get my ultrasound results back, we\\'ll know more. But he said if it really is PCOS, we\\'ll start metformin. How has this worked for you?\\n\\nKate\\nI know there are things they can do to manipulate things - once you\\'ve gone long enough for them to say you have fertility problems.\\nBut right now I\\'d worry about getting over this and THEN start talking to your Doctor about fertility issues.\\n\\nIf your husband is still in the military they have an excellent infertility program at Walter Reed for very little money (which is nice because Tricare pays for almost nothing), but you have to cover your own travel.  I know - I am having babies 2 and 3 that were made in their lab there in a couple months.\\nPart of the protocol you spend a month on BC pills, a month shooting up with hormones to super ovulate (and have a period in there), and then they do the extraction.  Some people can conceive just by using the medication - without the in vitro.  I was not one of them, but I knew some who did.  Good luck!\\nWhere is this Walter Reed place? I\\'m interested to hear more about this.\\n\\nI\\'ve learned that you really have to do your own research with Tricare and be your own advocate. Most of the time Drs. won\\'t help you with the extras, and you really have to know your stuff and push for what you want. If you\\'re not one step ahead, then you\\'re 5 steps behind with Tricare.\\nWalter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington D.C.\\n\\nThe thing with Tricare is all they will tell you is that \"we don\\'t cover that.\"  When the hidden secret is that if you travel to one of the big hospitals you can get the procedure for free performed by a military Doctor at a military hospital.  I think Walter Reed is the best for the infertility stuff, but I believe the big hospitals in Pearl Harbor (Navy hospital) and in San Antonio (Air Force) also perform the procedures.  It doesn\\'t matter what branch your spouse is in - they serve their area not the specific service.\\n\\nWalter Reed has alot of information about what they offer on their website if you look it up - the others might also.\\n\\nI do my best to pass the word, because after I did it I found out about so many people who paid for it themselves or adopted because they couldn\\'t afford to pay for it.  All because no one told them about the program.\\n\\nYou are AMAZING!!!!!\\n\\nWe\\'re not near DC, we\\'re in Florida. But if it comes to that (down the road) needing IVF, then I would be more than willing to spend some time in DC with friends while going through the procedure. So...how do I go about doing that?? Do I tell my Dr. I want to pursue IVF at Walter Reed? Do I just call WR and set up an appointment? Do I talk to my Tricare line first? I\\'m dying to hear more about this!\\n\\n\\nKate\\nOk, I\\'m not military but I have been dealing with PSOC for quite a while. I haven\\'t had any babies, but I haven\\'t really tried. I suffered for years with abnormal periods that went on for months. BC only helped when I was on it and I suffered from really bad depression I now believe was related to it. It was horrible. I had to insist that my Doctor prescribe Metformin after much research on my part. And it has made my periods normal for the first time since I was a teenager.  And my depression gone. Also I lost alot of weight added bonuses.  I would make sure to keep on your DR about the metformin. In my research I found that many women with PCOS have gotten preg by just taking metformin as a matter of fact I have a friend who wasn\\'t trying to get preg but had to be put on metformin for the same reason and now has 2 kids. That\\'s what made me a believer.  Had to see it.\\n\\nInfertmert\\nThank you for the encouragement infertment.\\n\\nI really do have a great Dr. I\\'m just frustrated that I have to wait until the tests. I understand (things take awhile with military hospitals) but still, it\\'s frustrating.\\n\\nI just want the period to stop. So he said after that happens, I\\'ll start on metformin. It slowed down, but it hasn\\'t stopped yet. I still have to use tampons. But that\\'s alright...it\\'s way better than it was. And we\\'re gettign there.\\n\\nI\\'m just so excited to try the metformin. I\\'m trying to keep realistic about it and not get TOO excited...but I can\\'t help it. We\\'re just dying to have a baby.\\n\\nKate\\nTo get into the program you get your PCM to refer you for being infertile and they have a list of blood tests you have to get done that you fax in along with that to Walter Reed.  There is also a Saline Sonogram that has to be done.  If you go to their website (Walter Reed) and go under the gyno department andf then the infertility department from there, they have the list of things you need to complete your \"package.\"  Once you send all that in you go on the waiting list.  I think I waited about 6 months the first time.  Hardly at all the second time.  Hopefuly you won\\'t need it though!\\nI had a never ending period myself.  At first they thought it was hypothyroidism.  Eventually, I was sent for an ultrasound and MRI. A solid mass was found on my ovary.  It turned out to be a granulosa cell carcinoma. This is a very rare but slow growing type of cancer.  It is also unlikely to spread.  The reason it causes a never ending period is that the tumor produces estrogen.  It was treated by removing the ovary.  No other treatment was necessary.  Good Luck!\\nI was on the never-ending period too. From Sept of 06-till now 5/07. My regular obgyn told me that it was just a side effect of PCOS that I would live with...\\nI finally started to see an RE instead of a regular obgyn and he was he was helpful in that he gave me provera to help get rid of all the yucky stuff that was causing the non-stop bleeding, and even though I had been bleeding for the last 7-8 mos I still had a massive period, it was awful, but now it has stopped, thank God, and now I will start clomid to help with my infertility. But be prepared that even if you have been bleeding non-stop there could be alot in your uterus that your body is not able to get rid of. See a doctor who will help you with this.\\nHi\\n\\nI Also had a never ending period about 5 months before they could stop it , they tried all sorts of med but with no luck. They eventually gave me a DNC and some injections every day(dont no the name. it eventually stopped.\\n\\nI an now on permenet birth control injections to control it!\\n\\nJen',\n",

I am on Anaprox DS 550 mg right now, but that doesn't even help the pain sometimes. i am on nausea pills as well, but I think the throwing up is related to the gallbladder. The PCOS has already brought on Diabetes, and I have no idea what otehr things PCOS does. I don't know the symptoms ro anything. Can you help??\\nHey guys! Just wanted to say that the cramps are continuing to get worse. I am having a hard time sitting sometimes, and the meds aren't doing anything. Especially when I am on my period, but even when I am not. OUCH!! What causes this much pain?? It is in the pelvic area, really really low. I keep crossing my legs to apply pressure, adn it seems to help jsut a tad, but it hurts so bad, I just curl up in a ball and can;t move sometimes.\\nBannanarama,\\n\\nI too have pcos and when period shows up it comes with painful cramps.Ask your doctor to prescribe mefenamic acid tablets (aka ponstan) these are great muscle relaxants that are non drowsy.\\n\\nLet me know how you go\\nx\\nThaks!

I won't be able to see my GYN until August (long story, but basically I am going out of state until then). Right now I am living off of no money what so ever. I am really cramped up, even when not on my period. Right now things are being aggrivated even more with kidney stones that may need to be blasted. I really don't know what to do right now, because I have to move out of the dorms on Saturday, and I have to find a urologist. I am moving home for two weeks, and then going out of state for a few months. Not sure exactly ehat to do, or how to handle things. Everything is up in hte air right now becasue of my health problems. I just had my gallbladder removed a month ago. Eeek. I am stressed to the max, which doesn't help the cramping either.\\nI will definitly be looking into that medication though, and ask my GYN about it when I can get in to see her. Right now I am on pain killers for hte kidney stones, so everything is being kept relatively pain free for a couple of hours at a time.\\nB,\\n\\nI hope you feel better soon.\\n\\nx\\nSo, an update. I had to have my kidney stones surgically removed, and now I have more. I am still having absolutely horrible cramps, and can't tell whether it is from teh kidney stones or the PCOS. Not on my period right now, but that has never stopped me from having cramps before. I am on muscle relaxers for the kidney stones, but they are not helping the pain. Right now I am just wanting to get out of the pain. On vicodin as well, and well, not helping anything. Also, I cannot afford my birth control for this month, so I am afraid that when my period starts later this week, it won't stop until I can afford it. Really don't know what to do. Scared, because I don't want to go through that again! A couple of years ago, I had a period that lasted 6 months, and was put on Provera to stop it, and then ws on Provera for about a year and a half, but hten switched to the NuvaRing. I have not been off of something for my period for 2 years, so I don't know what to do. My GYN is a couple of hours away, so I can't go and get samples. I couldn't go to camp due to the recent surgeries and the probablity that I will have to have anotehr one. Right now I don't know what to do!! Thanks!\\nDaisy\",\n",

I haven't been off of either Provera or the NuvaRing since, and it has been about two years now. I am worried that if I don't take the birth control, my period won't stop until I can afford it, which might take a little while. I am on a lot of other meds, but they are cheaper. My doctor here at home doesn't have samples of it, and I can't afford a trip back to my doctor at school to pick them up. Any suggestions? I can't afford a doctors appointment either. I guess my question is if there is another way to stop my period. I have been told that any other birth control is a bad idea, due to having migraines, and also a huge family history of stroke as well as other heart problems, so my GYN said not to go for anything with higher dosages of estrogen. Any suggestions I could possibly do? They took me off of the Provera in order to regulate my periods more, but I could afford that medicine, so should I call my GYN and ask her to call me in a prescription for that? I am also having issues with possible kidney stones (I just had some removed a month ago, but they think that they are back). Definitely not having fun having my period and kidney stones at the same time. Please help!!\\nDaisy\\nI'm not very familiar with your condition, but I do know that you can get a free sample of nuva ring from their website or by going to planned parenthood if you have one of them. You said your family has history of stroke, well I've heard and looked up that you have a higher risk of having a stroke from nuva ring than any other birth control. I took nuva for about 6 months and stopped because my doctor said that I had a TIA whichi is a mini stroke which was most likely caused from the nuva ring. I'm also only 25. I dont think I'll ever take it again. Good luck to you.\\nThank you so much! I will ask my doctor about that. I had no idea about it having a higher risk for stroke. What would you suggest that I do about it?? Which birth control would be better?\",\n",

She Doesn\\'t Think I Am But She Has Me Going For Bloodwork.  I Have To Fast For 8 Hours And Drink Something And Have Blood Drawn.  She Doesn\\'t Think I Am Because She Said I\\'m Not Overweight.  I Think 165 Lbs @ 5\\' 3\" Is Overweight! Also Since I Was Only 150 A Year Ago, I Think That Is A Considerable Weight Gain In Less Than A Year!  I Don\\'t Know What She Is Looking At.  I Have Been Fatigued All The Time.  Is This A Symptom Of Insulin Resistance?  I Used To Have A Lot Of Energy.  Working Out At Least 4x Week.  Now I Don\\'t Have The Energy To Work Out At All!  I Was Diagnosed With Polycystic Ovaries After A Sonogram A Few Years Ago And I Get My Period Every 2 Months Or So.\\n\\nAny Info Would Be Appreciated.\\nYou can\\'t look at someone & say, \"I don\\'t think you\\'re Insulin Resistant\". The way the specialists explained it to me & my husband is the Insulin Resistance causes the PCOS, not the other way around.\\n\\n\\nAlso, the lack of energy and always feeling tired could be from uncontrolled blood sugars. (trust me, I\\'m Diabetic with PCOS, lol) The blood work/fasting glucose she\\'s having you do will tell a lot. Although I am not a Dr, I would recommend her doing a A1C do see what your glucose has done over the past 3 months! Weight doesn\\'t play a factor in Insulin Resistance. There are overweight & skinny people who are Type 1 & Type 2 Diabetics, some their pancreas just doesn\\'t use the insulin their body makes and some don\\'t produce any!\\nGood luck hon!\\nI have the insulin resistance.  The way I found out was when my doctor did a fasting insulin level on me and it was elevated.  Then about 3 months later we did another and it kept going up. However, my blood sugar was normal.  I was supposed to have a 2 hour gtt, (glucose tolerance test).  This helps to diagnose Diabetes and or hypoglycemia.  I finally got a doctor to listen to  me about the insulin level going up and becoming out of the norm range and I was put on Metformin, but this may not work for everyone.  I also had excessive weight gain in a year, 40+ pounds.  Insulin resistance can make you gain the weight. Problem is getting the insulin resistance under control to try to help  lose it weight.  I have had PCOS for years before I was actually diagnosed with it.  It is a matter of finding a doctor that will listen to you and work with you to find out what is going on. BUT, I also had other hormone levels out of range and a positive ultrasound of the ovaries that got me the diagnosis. Hope that all goes well for you.  I know it is an uphill battle, but the only way to treat the PCOS is to treat the symptoms...ie: Insulin resistance, infertility, depression, etc.   Good luck again\\n\\n\\nTHANKS FOR THE REPLY.  I AM GOING FOR THE FOLLOWING BLOOD WORK TOMORROW:  GLUCOSE-FASTING, GLUCOSE TOLERANCE 75 GRAM, AND INSULIN SERUM.\\n\\nARE THOSE THE PROPER TESTS FOR TESTING FOR INSULIN RESISTANCE?\\nI was about to post on the same thing when i found this thread.  I\\'ve known ive had blood sugar or insulin problems, before and after i eat, but my doctor never listened to me and only did a fasting BS test wich came out normal at 80, now i know im not crazy!!! thanks a bunch!\\n',\n",

If So, How Much And How Long Did It Take AND HOW MUCH WERE YOU TAKING IN MG?\\nWhen I first started Metformin, I followed a simple diet - a bowl of Special K or Kashi cereal in the morning, a yogurt for a snack, for lunch I'd have a salad (or something else, whatever I desired), then another snack, then dinner, and another snack 3-4 hours before bed. I lost 7lbs in less than 2 weeks and was taking 2,000mg/day of Metformin. I also exercised - A LOT of cardio but I gained it back when I lost motivation because of other Infertility issues.\\n\\nMetformin does help but it kept me very sick ... and I have always thought it DIDN'T work because of that, not to mention my cycles were not restored. (I have PCOS) But, with weight loss, I think it played a role in helping me!\\nWhen I first started on Metformin (Diaformin) I was taking 3 x 1000mg a day & dropped from 103kilos to 86 in a few months. I'm now back up to 100 after a knee dislocation & can't seem to loose any now. Still on my meds but they make me so sick & have not lost a single kilo in over a year\\n\\nI have been on 1000mg's of Metformin, twice a day, for 2 years now.  I have lost 40 pounds, but I have also been trying to follow a low fat/low salt diet.   The first month I was on Metformin, I lost 15 pounds fast. The rest of the weight has been difficult. I have been doing the low fat/salt diet since Jan. 2007. But now I am at a peak, and having a hard time losing anymore.\\n\\nI agree with the losing motivation due to the infertility issue. I have the same problem.  It does get depressing.\\nI have been on Metformin for a little over a year and lost 15 pounds as a result.  The weight comes off in stages.  It will be stagnant or increase for a while and then drop right after I get my period.  Then it will continue to plateau and then drop again.  Due to kidney problems I am on a low protein/ high carb diet so I may not be typical.\\n\\nIve been on metformin for a year, first 500mg then increased to 1500 mg a day, it helped my skin but thats it.  ive found it very very hard to loose wieght, probably because of lack of motivation - if it's not coming off fast and obviously, i get quite low about it.  it works if i dont eat anything.  haha.\\nI've been on Metformin for 5 months - 1500mg, and have not lost any weight.\\nI've been on 1350mg for about 3 months now and so far I've lost 17lbs.\",\n",

I have started using progesterone cream and still no luck with the period, but I have only been on it for 2 months. My dr wants me to take metformin and birth control pills to try to regulate my periods and lesson some of my symptoms. I cannot take the metformin, it makes me extremely sick. Anyone elses experience with this would be wonderful, it feels as though I am running around in circles.\\nMetformin made me sick to but then the doctor told me to taper onto it slowly and use the XR formula and that helped a lot.  They also say following a strict Atkins diet can help - no carbs at all.  I have not tried this as i have kidney disease so can't.\\nI was also wondering if anyone has cholesterol abnormalities from PCOS. I have read that they go hand in hand with PCOS. I currently have good cholesterol and so I was just wondering if this is something I am going to have to look out for in the future.\\nMy cholesterol has always been high, even when I was a vegan.\\nsee that is what makes me wonder if I haven't been misdiagnosed. I have never had any blood work done to check my fasting insulin levels. I have always had the dark pigmention on the back of my neck ever since I can remember. It is just really frustrating when u don't know what is going on with your own body.

I just would like some answers, all of this started right after the birth of my last child and I am just at a loss for what it could be. I am not comfortable just taking my dr's word for what is going on and wish I had some definitive testing to back up the diagnosis.\\nI had PCOS and had normal cholesterol and trigliceride levels. According to the NIH standards, you need to have Cushing's ruled out so you need a lot more testing to make sure your cortisol is ok. Also get a copy of your ultrasound report (as well as your bloodwork) to make sure that all your tests are consistent with PCOS - in that you have multiple cysts and that your LH and FSH are in the ratios that meet the diagnosis.\\nI say that as I had Cushing's disease too and it is unusual to have both. The symptoms overlap.\\nGood luck to you.\\nDid a family Dr diagnose or were you going to your OB/GYN? I have just been going to my family Dr and he hasn't suggested me seeing an GYN so I am unsure of who to go to for the testing.\\nI have PCOS and have had it for a long time just didn't realize what it was.

I used prometrium and povera back in September, one worked and one didn't. I can't remember which one worked.  After this bleed is when the doc put me on BCP and metformin.  I just hope this regulates itself.  I'm on cd43 I think. I've been temping this month, started midcycle though.  I didn't temp yesterday morning because I forgot to set the alarm. I temped this morning and entered it online and according to that, it says I ovulated I think on the 7th.  My SO has been gone for three weeks so obviously that doesn't do me much good!! Makes me wonder if I really ovulated or not.  I havent been checking CM or cervix position or anything like that.\\nHow long were you TTC and on metformin before the clomid?  I was told many docs won't do that until you've been trying at least a year.  I was at the doc about a week ago and I didn't bring this subject up. I'd like to try on our own before we resort to that.\\nI felt the same way.\\n\\nI went off bcp last Dec 2005.  I was already not having periods for a couple of months.  So a little history, we thought I was pregnant and it was okay so when we found out I was not pregnant we decided to try to get pregnant.  Anyway, it took one doctor 7 months of different bcp and Provera and no period to send me to another doctor.\\n\\nA thousand blood tests and labs later, I was diagnosed with PCOS.  My doctor told me that according to my labs he didnt think I could get pregnant without Clomid or some type of fertility treatment.  That is why I take the glucophage and will take the clomid.\\nI have been taking metformin since Nov 06.\\nI was diag with pcos 6months ago i was on metformin and it made me sick to my stomach. My husband and i were going through a lot with the death of his dad at the time. We are actually going to go get a 2nd opinion. I just dont understand that if i have pcos then why do i get my cycle every month on time?\",\n",

I am very satisfied with the results and i highly recommend accutane. BUT, i was diagnosed with PCOS after I took accutane, turns out my acne battle for 10 years was probably caused by my PCOS. Do everything you can to get the PCOS under contol first and see if it clears up. many people have success with ortho tricylcen to clear acne and regulate periods. I did not, infact the pill made me a little bit crazy. I now use the nuva ring and I love it. Periods are regular, not really a big deal at all. Accutane is a really big step, but if it comes down to it, use it.\\nwill the accutane cure the acne for good? my doctor says there's no point in taking the accutane because the acne will return after the treatment due to my pcos. i would like to find something to cure the acne... not just supress it (like birth control pill)\",\n",

I have all the classic symptoms, weight gain, increased facial hair, funky periods, bad bad acne, etc etc.  Yet when I went to the Dr. and she did blood work everything came back normal.\\n\\nI had a CT scan last year for something unrelated and they saw cysts on my ovaries.  When I went for an U/S they said there were none.\\n\\nI went to the GYN for my yearly pap about a month ago and told him of my symptoms and normal blood work and he did an u/s of my ovaries.  He said I had the classic PCOS ovaries.  I had 10 cysts on my right and a golfball size cyst on my left along with 4 or 5 smaller ones.  I'm now being treated for PCOS and things are much improved.\\n\\nPoint is, is that there are so many symptoms and you might not have all of them, and still have PCOS.  Or you might have some of them some of the time.  I've heard before that PCOS is a diagnosis of exclusion.  I would definitely look into it further and talk to your Dr. about your symptoms and concerns.\\nThanks for the replies.\\nMaybe this is a stupid question, but do the cysts create some type of pain as they form?  Like cramping or anything?  I don't experience anything...\\nI didnt feel anything, just noticed that when i did have a period the cramps were painfull but put it down to the fact it didnt happen often.\\n\\nx\",\n",

It's not sharp and stabbing.....but rather cramp-ish.\\nMy Gyno kept using my weight as an issue also.  She didn't want to give me time off from work, so I went back to my regular physician who also didn't feel it necessary to be off work.  My next appointment I took my mother with me and she demanded they take me off of work until I can try to get the pain under control.  I just got a CT scan done and waiting for those results to confirm my PCOS/Endemetriosis.  One thing I have found out is, doctors like treat symptoms not the problem and you have to take control of your health and make doctors do necessary testing especially if you have family history.\\n\\nI am currently not taking any herbs so I don't know what I can tell you to take.

I have gone through sooo many dr.s and have been on pain killers for about a month now.. all my do9ctors do is ignore me.. The one i just saw the other day tol mne to my face that I was making it up. I was not thrilled, I too have had to quit jobs, ben fired.. I cant do anything aqnd I dont have a life. At least I am not the only one. If any of you hear anything plase let me know what it could be... I need my life back... Thyanks everyone!!!!!\\nMiranda\\nI'm not the only one!!!!!yay!!!err...It stinks that we're all in pain the majority of the time, but I'm so happy cuz I thought I was the only one.  The pain just doesn't go away.  It's mostly like cramping but gets real sharp sometimes too.  I used to go to my doctor, but that doesn't get me anywhere anymore.  My diagnosing doc just told me I had pcod and did nothing else.  I switched doctors and he put me on metformin(glucophage), but it made me really sick and didnt help any.  I complained enough that he gave me vicodine, but when I went back and told him I was still in pain, he pretty much said that pcod doesn't cause constant pain, didn't investigate further, and refused to give me anything for the pain.  I have had to quit jobs as well due to the excruciating pain that I have almost every day.  It is wearing on both my mental wellbeing and my marriage, as I am mostly moving at a very slow pace, and sex is almost out of the question.  I just don't know what to do anymore.  I can't take most herbal remedies due to another medical condition, so I just don't know what to do.  If anyone has suggestions, or just wants to talk, I'm pretty much alone here.  I can't afford medical help right now, so any advice or friendly chat would be very welcomed.  Thanks and you're all in my prayers.\\nI too am in daily pain.  I had a burst cyst in 3/06, had a lap surgery to look at the ovaries and she took out my appendix, and was told ovary's fine.  Since then I have had several more cysts.  I stay in pain.  I am now looking into having a hystorectomy, I have no ovary function at all.  I am 42 in full blown menapause and very tired of the pain.  I have been crazy with thinking it is all in my mind.  It's not severe enough to go to er and I hate to go to hospital to get sonogram every other week.  But, I don't have PCOS.  I just looked that up.  I don't know what I have but, I don't want it anymore.\\nim getting the shooting pains now ... i have pcos was diagnosed with it 4 years ago.. i had a baby miracusly 12 weeks ago just got my first period and the shooting pains are worse!! got gyni next week.... i to had a cyst removed 10 years ago was huge apparently so that scares me i could have another big one..\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hello everyone~\\nI have just been diagnosed with pcos, and my gyn gave me a prescription for metformin.  I was just wondering if anyone knows if metformin is only to be taken to get pregnant, or if you can take it to just help with the insulin and getting hormones straightend out?  Or is just regular diet and exercise better for that?  I dont know why but I am really driving myself crazy over all this stuff!!  I guess I just dont know what to do, whether to take the med or not, or if im ready to try to get pregnant....and I am really scared of diabetes!\\n\\nWe meet again! When my doc prescribed metformin, he also put me on the pill. His exact words were \"now try not to get pregnant!\" haha...yeah well I went off the pill for two reasons. 1) We decided we would like to try for a baby and 2) I wanted to know if the metformin REALLY was helping. Well, I ended up having a period being on metformin in January.  A lot of women that can lose some weight ( i think its somewhere between 5 and 10% of your current weight) will find that the PCOS will \\'clear up\\' on its own. I haven\\'t been able to lose much weight so I don\\'t know about this.  I think if you can take control of your weight you might not have to stay on the metformin.  Some doctors just put you on birth control, but that hides the symptoms.  I strongly suggest taking the metformin.  If you are worried about pregnancy, just take birth control too and you shouldn\\'t have a problem! I\\'m worried about diabetes too; my grandma has it and I really don\\'t want to deal with that.\\nSara\\nokay i\\'m one severe good outcome of metformin either that or i really sad case of an eating disorder. But I was 220 lbs at my highest at age 14 and lost over 120 lbs after being put on it. Now I hover at \"norm\". It DOES reduce cravings for sugar and brings on periods. I\\'ve been off it for two years now. And have had a period pretty normally since... So again. Really good metformin outcome? or really bad eating disorder? nobody knows.... however It does help with insulin resistance and hormones, and therefore the root cause of PCOS....\\n\\nNot sure if it can bring on Pregnancy or not. But I have PCOS, and I take Metformin too. Metformin is supposed to boost your metabolism, it keeps you from not eating so much ( which is something that I have a problem with).\\nMetformin is a good a drug, it does help you have less cravings on sugar, and like another poster said, it does bring on periods.\\n\\nDon\\'t worry about Metformin, it will help you.',\n",

       " {'post': \"hello everyone~ First off, I want to give you a bit of history...\\n\\nI have always had regular periods. I started becoming irregular about 2 years ago. I just flat out would not get my period! Doctor's would dismiss my concerns because blood work would come back normal for hormone inbalances. They would perscribe BCP's and send me on my way. While taking BCP's, I was fine. I was getting my periods as usuall and very ponctual. I then decided to go off of BC- the hole roller coaster started all over again. It seemed as though I could not get my period without some sort of hormone therapy. WEIRD! Now this last visit, I asked my GYN for the THIRD time what the heck is going on with me. He told me that my blood tests(that were taken about 6 months ago-and told to me they came back normal) showed some signs that suggests PCOS.\\n\\n-I am having an issue with this diagnosis because although I do have a couple of the symtoms associated with PCOS(thining hair/no periods), I have not had abnormal facial hair growth, unusual weight gain, or acne. In fact, I have never suffered from acne my entire LIFE! Yea I did gain about 10 pounds within 6 months, but that was all me! I was eating like a COW. I knew I was gaining weight and did nothing to prevent it. So my 10 pounds should have no association with PCOS. I'm just abit confused and worried that it might be something else. Now my doctor says- loose weight, excercise and you should become regular within a few years. He tells me that PCOS is something I'm BORN with. Don't understand because I haven't had any problems in the past up until now.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong- I REALLY like my doctor. He is a very intelligent person and I trust what he says, but it seems as though my symptoms and the diagnosis do not add up. I have also been having Pelvic pain. He gave me a pelvic exam and says everything looks good.\\n\\n\\nAnother question- isn't PCOS associated with small cycts around your overies? He checked me and said I don't have any.\\n\\nI know this is abit long, but any advice or recommendations will help a great deal.  And have any of you used Herbal remedies to get your periods regular agian?  I'm not the biggest fan of birth control. Increases your risks of alot of other issues.\\n\\n\\nIt seems as though one medication will help you with one illness, but will cause another!\\n\\n\\nThanks- Wishing_Well\\nHave you given any thought to seeing a Endocrinologist?  They specialize in hormonal disorders/syndromes such as PCOS.  That would be your best bet because a regular GYN does not specialize in that.\\nThanks Barton! I appreciate your help. One more thing, Do I need a doctor's referral to see one?\\nThat will depend on what type of medical insurance you have.  Call your insurance company and ask them if you need a referral to see a specialist.  You may also want to see if the coverage changes as well.........for instance, if they pay 80% for you to see a regular physician....maybe the coverage goes down to 70% if you see a specialist.  Even if you do need a referral, it usually isn't too much of a hassle to get one from your primary care physician.  Best of luck.............and if you have any more questions, just ask!\",\n",

I lost 30lbs from Nov to Jan.

If it did, how many rounds did it take?  If not, what treatment did you go through next?\\nI took clomid 3 different times & got pregnant each time.  1 pregnancy ended in miscarriage but I have 2 beautiful boys thanks to this med.  I always got pregnant on the 3rd month of use.  Good luck!\\nI also have PCOS and couldn't get pregnant for one year and 8 months.  After the first year with no assistance and no luck I started the clomid.  I took it for 5 months with no luck.  Then I took 1 month off just to see if my body would kick into gear and have a period on its own, but that didn't work so back onto the provera & clomid I went.  This time my OB doc upped my dosage from 100mg to 150mg and presto whamo..... now I'm 8 weeks pregnant and having my first ultrasound tomorrow.  Just hang in there.  I was very very doubtful for the longest time too but this stuff does work.  Just relax.  That seemed to help too cause I got pregnant on one of the most relaxing enjoyable month ever.  I had no worries for once and that was a first in a long time so I kind of think that may have helped too.

       " {'post': 'I\\'m on day 17 of my period.\\nThis is officially the longest period I\\'ve ever had. (I\\'m 26 years old) Normally they last about 5-6 days but this has been over two weeks so obviously, I\\'m getting concerned. (By the way, I am not on any birth control and not pregnant) And it\\'s not by any means a heavy period, mostly light to medium flow with occassional clots (sorry to be graphic)\\n\\nMy cycles are very irregular too. I\\'ll go months without having a period. But sometimes I do get one every month. I tend to alternate between having regular monthly cycles to having not so regular cycles)\\n\\nI\\'ve been looking up other symptoms of pcos online and I have the facial hair thing (annoying chin hairs!), and I have a little acne, but I am not overweight as I only weigh 100 pounds. Although I do have concerns about my blood sugar (I think i have low blood sugar) but i don\\'t know if that could be related in any way.\\n\\nI guess I just want to hear from people who have this condition...i know not having your period could mean you have it, but is having a period that lasts for more than two weeks also a sign of pcos? Has anyone ever had a period that lasted this long? I just want it to stop!\\n\\nYes, that could definitely be PCOS. You really need to see a doctor and explain all of your symptoms and get properly tested for PCOS and related conditions that could cause similar symptoms (including glucose tolerance test testing your glucose and insulin response). \"Healthy\" weight women can have PCOS. Low blood sugar can be a sign of insulin resistance - but you really need to be tested for this!\\n\\nDo you eat healthily and exercise? If not, this is a good thing to do for general health, but especially important if you have PCOS.\\nmelody:\\n\\nI am going through the exact same thing. I just found out yesterday that my probable diagnosis is pcos. I have an ultrasound scheduled for May 9th, so it\\'s not 100%. But my dr.\\'s quote was \"If I was a betting man...\" so it\\'s a pretty sure thing.\\n\\nI\\'ve been on my period for 5 weeks. Yeah...I\\'m being serious. 5 weeks. Over a month. My last period before this was in November. I\\'m not on birth control...haven\\'t been for almost a year. And I\\'m 23.\\n\\nIt\\'s been annoying. My doctor perscribed progesterone to finally halt the period. I haven\\'t filled it yet, I have to get to a specific pharmacy. But he gave me a 10 day script. The first two days are supposed to cleanse me out, then stop. And then I\\'ll start up again, which is supposed to be my \"regular\" period. And the day that it starts back up would be my cycle day 1. It should be a very very short \"period\" and then we will figure things out from there.\\n\\nDefinitely go to the doctor as soon as possible. That way they can start the process of figuring out if this is what is going on. The earlier you can figure this out, the better.\\n\\nIn our case, we were about to start trying to conceive...so it\\'s good we figured it out now rather than 2 years down the road with no child to show for it.\\n\\n\\nKate\\nThanks for the responses. I\\'m definitely going to make an appt. to see a doctor soon, it\\'s just the waiting around and not knowing what\\'s going on part that\\'s driving me crazy. I always knew something about how my body functions is strange. It would be nice if I could get an explanation.\\n\\nBy the way, my period is STILL with me, day 18 now. But it\\'s been a very light flow today so I\\'m hoping that maybe this could be the last day of it (fingers crossed!)\\nHey! I have had PCOS for almost 2 years now. When I got diagnosed it was because I had had my period for 6 months straight (really really heavy). I didn\\'t decide to go to a doctor until month 4 (I started getting anemic, and passing out). At this time, I was on summer break, and about a week from going to school, so there was nothing they could do really. I ended up having to find a GYN near my school. That took a few weeks, because there were only men accepting new patients, and I wasn\\'t comfortable, but I finally said ok, I\\'ll deal. My first visit he did an intervaginal ultrasound and found the cysts, and referred me to an endocrinologist, where I later found out I was diabetic.\\nHope all works out for you. Yeah, you should definitely get it checked out for sure. Don\\'t want to end up anemic and such.',\n",

Before taking Metformin my cycles were anywhere from 31-90+ days.  It seemed as each month they were getting longer and longer.\\n\\nMy Dr. first had me taking 1000mg of Metformin and in that first month I had a 28 day cycle.  It was crazy, literally the first time in my life that I had a 28 day cycle.  He recently upped my dosage to 1700mg a day and this month I\\'ve had a 21 day cycle.\\n\\nI know that it will probably take awhile for my cycle lengths to level out, but I was wondering if they will ever be a somewhat consistent length?

It might be a coincidence...but I don\\'t feel like it is. It\\'s not overwhelming by any means, and I\\'m fine taking the meds if it\\'s what I need.

I can\\'t tell...from my research sometimes it says different things. Such as \"Heavier women are the ones who tend to be diagnosed with PCOS,\" which leads me to believe that being heavier can be a contributor to PCOS. But then I read \"PCOS patients tend to have excessive weight gain,\" which is the opposite in that PCOS is the cause of the gain. I\\'m so confused!!!\\n\\nThanks for anything!\\n\\nKate\\nHi! I was put on Provera for about a year and a half, and I didn\\'t feel good at all while I was on it, but I was on it because i had had a heavy period that lasted 6 months, and the doctor wanted it to stop (and I did too!!). I couldn\\'t take birth control pills because I have a strong risk of having a stroke (at 20 y/o??). After the period stopped, it just never wanted to come back, adn the lining in my uterus got extremely thick, so he had me use it every month, if I could not start my period naturally. I changed GYNs, and they put my on the NuvaRing birth control, because of hte low levels of estorgen, and at first I felt horrible, but after 2-3 months I finally felt like myself again, and no longer was moody. I don\\'t know if stomach problems were associated with it at first or not, because I found out recently that my gallbladder was bad, and so I just had it removed. Anyways, the NuvaRing seems to be working much better for me in terms of feeling better than the Provera (medroxyprogestrone). I have PCOS, and was diagnosed with it in 2005. It has been almost exactly 2 years since that horrible period first started. Now I am pretty much regular, with the ring. Has your GYN mentioned birth control possibilities?\\nI hope that things work out for you, and that you start to feel better!!\\nHe did say that birth control would make things better if I wanted, but my husband and I are trying to conceive. So birth control wouldn\\'t be an option.\\n\\nThanks for the info banana. Does anyone else have an experience to share?\\n\\n\\nKate\\nGood luck!\\n',\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi,\\n\\nI was diagnosed with PCOS and insulin resistance in March last year after not being able to get pregnant. I was healthy weight and ate healthily and exercised, but was told I had this condition because of unhealthy lifestyle. I was told that I had to eat a special diet and exercise a lot to complement the medication in treating PCOS and insulin resistance.\\n\\nI did change my diet and I exercised more, but then my periods which had been irregular, stopped altogether. I lost a fair bit of weight (considering I didn't weigh that much to begin with and I am only small anyway) - but was apparently supposed to be still big enough to ovulate and get periods (according to some doctors). According to a dietician, I had to put on more weight and eat more fat (a big no-no if you are insulin resistant!). So I did that and I have found that after a while my periods have come back - irregular but have come back.\\n\\nBUT I am finding as time goes on that I really REALLY hate food, and I really don't want to eat. The only thing that makes me eat is when I think I won't get a period if I don't eat. I blame the food for PCOS, I blame it for infertility. I feel if I eat, then I will not get a period because I am insulin resistant, yet if I do not eat, I will not get a period anyway, so I am in a lose-lose situation.\\n\\nI have tried to be so healthy with what I eat, yet my periods are still irregular - like they were before I had to start eating to control my insulin levels and before I started medication for my insulin levels. I wonder what is the point of eating so healthily and hating food when it doesn't make a difference to my cycle - when in the past, before I even knew about a diet to control insulin, I was eating healthily enough to still get periods (although irregular). Sometimes I know that it gets to the stage of being better that I eat regardless of whether it is good for insulin or not, and yet in those situations, I end up feeling guilty for eating something that is not as good for my insulin levels.\\n\\nI hate all of this because before I was diagnosed with PCOS and insulin resistance and told it was because of my lifelstyle, I was so much healthier. I had such a healthy attitude to eating and food and I ate healthily with treats every now and then, and no feeling guilty about having treats, and I exercised as well and didn't hate food and exercise like I do now. The whole PCOS thing has messed up food and healthily lifestyle for me. I want things to go back to where they were before the PCOS diagnosis. But I don't know how to get there.\\n\\nAnyone being in this situation? Anyone able to help?\\nHey anyone with PCOS suffer this???\\n\\nJust want to know I'm not alone!!\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hello\\nI am 22 years old. This morning my doctor told me I have PCOS. I had suspected this is what he would find after all the tests... except. I have to wonder, is there different levels... or severity of PCOS?\\nHere is the facts:\\n-I DO have more hair then a lot of my peers, in a male pattern, but not so that i have to shave my face or anything, a waxing every other month is enough, and still the hair is soft not bristly....\\n-I do NOT have a weight problem, I am 5\\'9 and 140lbs, a very healthy weight and have never had an issue with keeping weight off regardless of what I eat.\\n- I do get sort of far spaced periods, (35 days apart) but they DO come, EVERY month EXACTLY 35 days apart without fail (unless under SERIOUS stress I have skipped 2 periods in the last 5 years, thats not too bad)\\n-The ultra sound did NOT see any cysts on my ovarys... no did the internal exam find anything out of the ordinary...\\n-I KNOW i do ovulate. I am very intouch with my body and always have been. I know that somtimes I will go month without ovulating, this has happend 2 times this year, but I know i usually ovulate...\\n-I get midcycle pain, but honestly, I wouldnt even call it serious PAIN, its just an annoing nagging feeling in my abdomine.\\n-I got my period at 16 and the first year it was all over the place but by 18 I was so regular I could set my watch to it, although they were quite heavy all along.\\n-over the years they have been regular in timing and I think pretty normal in heavyness, what ever \"normal\" means.\\nSo where is the problem? Is it the fact my cycle is 35 days long instead of 28? Is it the mid-cycle pain? Is it the hair growth (which my mother and grandmother and sister all had, and I assumed it was DARK eastern european hair)?\\nI guess I started to go to the doctor because of the dull aching mid cycle pain and painful periods... and now I have PCOS? Does this even SOUDN like PCOS ... perhaps very slight?\\nMy husband and I have decided we would like to try to have a baby but reading around the internet all you see is how high the risks of miscarraige are with PCOS, so I am scared to try because of this! My sister had PCOS and it resulted in 2 tubal pregnancies and eventually a hysto!! THis was by the age 27, luckily she had a child at a very young age (before her PCOS really took off) so was not shut out from being a mother. i do not want to follow this, we decided to have children young as we are stable and settled into our home and jobs but now this...\\nI feel too young to struggle with infertility that i dont even KNOW i have... we only ditched the b.c. THIS month so I dont knwo yet what my trouble will be. Honestly, i am more affraid of having miscaraiges then NOT even getting pregnant to begin with!\\nBut really.. does this even sound like PCOS and if so... perhaps a very mild case of it? I would love to know that \"lots\" of woman carry full term but the statistics seem stacked against that idea... the ones I have seen anyways.\\nanyone ? anything?\\nthanks for letting me rant on!\\nBefore I knew I had PCOS I tried two full years to get pregnant. I did OPK\\'s, took my temp., took prenatals, quit smoking, everything I could think of besides a fertility specialist.  I was only 20 when I started trying. My periods were all over the place.  I would go up to 75 days between cycles. I would just know that I was preggers and test negative all the time. Finally I decided to go on a diet because I was about 30 lbs overweight. Well, I lost 40 lbs and immediately concieved. I did have a difficult pregnancy. I had hyperemesis gravidium (severe morning sickness) and had to be taken out of work for 6 months. I had gestational diabetes, and toxemia.  But i carried to term and delivered without complications on my due date a healthy gorgeous baby girl. So miscarriages aren\\'t always the case.  Good luck!\\n\\nFirst of all, what kind of doctor did you see for a diagnosis?  If you didn\\'t see a specialist, such as a Reproductive Endocrinologist, I recommend that you go see one for a second opinion.  Reason being:  there is a myriad of symptoms that you could experience with PCOS.  You do not have to experience all or even the majority of them to have PCOS, but with the symptoms that you have mentioned............I\\'m on the fence for a couple of reasons.\\n\\n1)  You do get a period every month.  They may be every 35 days, but they are coming.  If your periods were more sporadic or for the most part absent, then it\\'d be more suspicious.\\n\\n2).  You do have male patterned hair growth, but that could be simply because of your heritage and not anything more than that.\\n\\n3).  No mention of polycystic cysts on your ovaries.\\n\\nDid you have blood work done?  If so, what did that show???  The blood work, your medical history and ultrasound is key to diagnosing PCOS.  Your medical history doesn\\'t raise any red flags in my opinion, and it doesn\\'t sound like your ultrasound amounted to anything.  So, what did they base your diagnosis on?  Your history that in my opinion doesn\\'t really say much?  I personally think you need a 2nd opinion.\\nBoogiewoogie- what an encredible story, that after all of that you were blessed with a healthy daughter! Congrats!!\\n\\nBarton- thank you for your input and opinion, you really made me think again.. what ARE they basing this diagnoses on?? I did get blood work and it came back that my testosterone levels were raised... You know the number 3.4 comes to mind... which he (yes it was a specialist, but a very hurried and kinda... arrogant one) he said that he considered this to be a \\'mild\\' raise and not an extreamly high number... I forget what the \\'normal\\' range for testosterone in women is... wish I didnt. But all my other hormones were in the normal range, just this one was elevated. And perhaps that was enough, with the male pattern hair and spaced out periods for them to say \\'ok, this is what it is\\'. the doctor had tunnel vision im sure. I KEPT having to correct him when he would say \"we need to get you having regular periods\\' - \\'you will not ovulate if you are not menstruating\\' and the like...\\nI kept having to say ... \\'no, I DO have periods, they ARE regular, they just come 5 days later every month, instead of the same day of each month, but ALWAYS 5 days later!\\' he just WASNT listening!! ARRRG.\\nAnd even MY doctor said it was more on the mild side...\\nbut really, they call it \"practicing\" medicine for a reason!\\nSo, I guess I just have to listen to my body. I know doctors dont have all the answers, and yes, perhaps a second opinion is in order. I suppose we will try to get pregnant and just like he said, if no luck by spring, we will go back. My biggest concern was some of the daunting stats. i have seen on the internet (BIG NO NO, researching on the internet, shame on me) that say 80% or higher of PCOS pregnancys end in miscarraige, those are some terrifieing numbers!\\nthank you again!\\nOh bless you Pink! That does help put my mind at ease!\\ncongrats on your 2, and your 1 on the way!\\n\\nNow onto the baby making, hearing your story makes me realize I am not going to KNOW unless I try, and I should not let a fear hold me back from my dreams! With any luck things will go smooth and uneventful!\\nHere\\'s to UN-eventful pregnancies!\\n\\n\\nHi Treehugger..........pregnancy can be achieved.....sometimes it just takes a little more effort.  I have 2 healthy children and as severe as my PCOS is (hair growth in all of the unwanted areas, type 2 diabetes, I\\'m overweight....among many other symptoms) I got pregnant after 4 rounds of Clomid.  Just hang in there.  I really question your diagnosis though.  Elevated testosterone can be other things as well.  Even as out of whack as my body is and with all of my symptoms, believe it or not..........my testosterone is at a normal level and always is whenever I have bloodwork done!!!!',\n",

Now i am still waiting for it.  I have a GYN appointment tommorow which I am nervous about as I have yet to have an exam for over 2 years.  I know its not an excuse but I used to live in Australia and now i live in the usa and just got insurance and you know how expensive GYN exams can be.\\n\\nAnyway over the last few months I got a blood test done and the doctor picked up I had a little high cholesterol and I am 24 years old.  I dont eat fatty foods and I hit the gym 4-5 times a week.  But now no period I get the odd cramping here and there but the biggest problem is my hair.  Its shedding like crazy.  Not only is it embaressing it makes me wonder if i am going to turn bald. I also sweat alot when i sleep and my boyfriend uncovers me cause he sometimes sees  sweat dripping off my head!!! The doctor did not find any other abnormalities in blood test and even checked my thryoid!\\n\\nThing is my sister has had cysts before and they cleared up on thier own and they just put her on the pill to regulate her cycle.  How will this affect me later on if i want to become pregnant later on?\\nI know some other symptoms of PCOS is excess growth of hair.  I dont have this at all i know some symptoms only affect some people but its kind of scary because this forum board is the only thing i have here because i have no family here in the usa for support. I appreciate your answers and if anyone else has been having symptoms like i have?\\n\\nThanks all\\n\\nSophie:\\n\\nI was just unofficially diagnosed a few days ago, (I have to wait for an untrasound) but I can share what I have learned in this short amount of time.\\n\\nIt sounds like you might have PCOS. It\\'s difficult to tell just by reading symptoms of course. I am only showing a few of the symptoms myself, and my doctor is still thinking it is PCOS. I don\\'t have any abnormal hair growth, nor hair loss. What HAS happend is this: I have gained quite a bit of weight over the past 3 years, but I am an avid exerciser. I also have extremely high cholesterol. I\\'m 23, and have a pretty decent diet (we absolutely do not eat red meat). I stopped taking bcp in June of 2006 (wanting to start conceiving at the end of the year) and I have since had 3 periods total. I\\'m on the third one...and it\\'s lasted FIVE WEEKS. That was the last straw, and I went to a brand new dr. who has helped me.\\n\\nAll of these things were individually explained by previous doctors as anything besides PCOS. \"Oh, you\\'ve put on weight since high school because your workout routine has changed. You need to work out harder/more. Your cholesterol is very high, but that\\'s genetic. Your periods are very irregular, but you haven\\'t been off the pill for a year yet, so that\\'s still pretty normal. Come back in a year. Oh, you\\'re young. You don\\'t need to worry about fertility yet. Everything will even out eventually.\"\\n\\nTurns out, a lot of it is connected to PCOS. I have an ultrasound for the second week of May, and that will be the deciding factor. But as my dr. has said, \"If I were a betting man, I\\'d diagnose PCOS right now.\"\\n\\nFor the meantime, he has given me Progesterone to stop my period (thank you Lord) and Iron (because of the blood loss). He has asked me to start charting.\\n\\nMy advice is this: start charting NOW. That way, when you get an appointment to see a doctor, you can show him/her, and you\\'re ahead of the game. They will want to know if you are ovulating and how things are going. If you are unsure of how to chart, then you should look up on the internet.\\n\\nIf you do not want to get pregnant right now, then a good way to control some of the symptoms is birth control pills. If you are looking into getting pregnant, then they have other medications you can take. Some women have absolutely no problem getting pregnant, even without meds. Some need the medication and then can conceive. And others still may require some more drastic measures. My advice is to talk to your Dr. about your timeline. Example: I don\\'t want to get pregnant now, but I\\'d like to be pregnant by the time I am 27. What should I do?\\n\\nBy all means, your first step is to chart. If you are not charting...again, look it up on the web. Search \"fertility charting\" or \"BBT charting\". And while you are doing that, make an appointment to see a Dr. And for sure, NEVER let a Dr. tell you there\\'s \"nothing wrong.\" If you feel out of whack, then you probably are. You know your body better than anyone else.\\n\\nI hope this has helped. I am still new to this myself. But feel free to ask away, and I can do the best to answer questions. And I\\'m sure anyone else on here will be more than happy to answer any questions as well!\\n\\nKate',\n",

I'm 29, have pcos and am also trying to get pregnant. If I remember correctly you can actually go up to higher doses of Clomid than 150mg. I had 8 cycles of Clomid combined with progesterone injections but unfortunately no results. Like you I never ovulated on it and my progesterone only measured .1, even with the supplements. Of course your doctor will know what's best in your particular situation, but you might want to ask about being put on metformin. It lowers insulin resistance in pcos women but has also been found to be beneficial for some dealing with difficulty conceiving. You might also want to ask about switching from Clomid to a drug called Letrozole (generic name femara). This works in basically the same way as Clomid by stimulating ovulation, but it is thought to be more effective than Clomid for women who have pcos. I've never tried acupuncture, but you'll find several women on these boards who feel it's beneficial, I'm interested in trying it. Your doctor should up your dosage of Clomid until you reach the maximum recommended, if you still have no results it will be time to consider other fertility meds. I had 8 cycles of Clomid, but in general 6 are what most women take before moving on. I also feel betrayed by my body but there are all sorts of medicines out there besides Clomid that can help you conceive, so please don't lose hope! Best of luck to you, keep us posted on your progress.\\nem\\nThanks! Am talking to her today, so will definitely ask her about all the suggestions below. Will keep you posted!\\nSo I can't get hold of my doc! Anyway, have emailed her my questions, will let you know how it goes. Also have found an acupuncturist who deals in infertility and apparently it's meant to have good results... Here's hoping! I can't believe you tried 8 cycles and it didn't work - very brave - I've only been through 1 and I was down in the dumps when it didn't work. I have this feeling Clomis won't work for me either - thanks again for the other drug names. If my doc ever calls me back, I'll ask her about them :-)\",\n",

       " {'post': \"I was prescribed metformin after 3 months on BC to get my period started.  I really want to get pregnant.  The first month of BC worked fine but the next month and the third month, I didn't have a period.\\n\\nLong story short, my doctor put me on metformin on the 15th of November.  I am supposed to be on 850mg twice a day but I could not handle that much due to nausea and diarrhea, therefore I cut back to 850mg once a day.  For the last two days, I have had slight cramping, really sore nipples and some vaginal discharge.\\n\\nCould metformin work that fast in getting things going?\\nHi Sweethome,\\n\\nNot sure if met could work that fast but there is always the chance\\nBabydust!!\\n\\nI just got put back on met today but have had it before. I think it can take up to 3 months for your body to adjust to it where you stop having so much nausea and side effects. There is a new extended release version of met available now you could ask about if the regular is causing too many problems. Good luck to you!\\nem\\nI think you need to talk to your doctor.  You can get other dosages besides the 850. It probably isn't wise to drop your dosage in half without consulting a doctor.  I take 3 500mg a day, two in the morning and one a night.  I find with the morning pills its best to eat something with them or soon after. This helps with the nausea.  The single pill at night doesnt bother me, could be cuz i take it right before bed, i'm not sure.\\nI talked with my doctor and he told me to take the prescription as prescribed to get the most benefit.  I tried taking the two pills per day and don't have the same symptons of nausea and bathroom issues.  It is not as severe as before and I am dealing with it.  I have only done 2 pills per day for 2 days.\\n\\nI have an appointment on Wednesday about the other symptons.  Hopefully it means that I am beginning to cycle and ovulate.  Fingers crossed.\\nGood news... AF is in the house!  This is good news because this is the first AF I had without any type of synthetic hormones in an entire year.  I believe the glucophage/metformin began to work that fast and that is the reason that I am cycling.  I am taking the full prescribed daily dosage without problems now.  Hopefully I will ovulate as well this month.  I am excited because this could mean no surgical procedures and just maybe I can get pregnant in a more conventional fashion....\\nHey Sweethome,\\nThat's wonderful news, sounds like you are really making progress and that will be great if you don't need to have any surgical procedures! Glad the met isn't giving you any side effects either, keep us updated on how you're doing, best of luck to you\\nem\\nHi!\\n\\nI am new to the boards. I was diagnosed with pcos and insulin resistance back in 2001. I started taking 500mg of metformin 3 times per day. Within 2 months I started getting my periods again. 2 months after that i was pregnant. My son is now 4 1/2 years old! I also have a 2 1/2 year old daughter. All thanks to metformin (and a little help from my husband)\\nBefore I was diagnosed, my family doctor didn't think I would be able to have children. My periods have always been few and far between. Sometimes I would only get AF once per year. Then I started the metformin and got my periods back and now have two great kids to show for it.\\n\\nSo hang in there and keep trying! I found that the side effects of metformin are a lot less if you watch what you eat. Try to cut down on your sugar and fat intake. And after you've been on it for awhile it's not so bad. Your body gets used to it.\\n\\ngood luck!\\nI was wondering how long it takes for your body to get used to the metformin.  I have tried cutting the pills in half and taking them 4 times all day.  I tried taking both pills at night.  I am still having side effects.  Will I just always have side effects or what?\\nWhen I first started on metformin, it upset my stomach ALOT.  I found that eating something or drinking a glass of milk with the pills helped them to settle easier.  I think it took about 4-6 weeks before I was used to them.  I take two 850 mg a day. One in the morning and one at night.  I can take them with water now.  My best advice is to eat with them.  That should take care of most of your side effects.\\nGood luck!!\\nSara\",\n",

I've always had some PCOS tendencies (excess hair over most of my body and cyclic acne). But throughout my 20s, I had clockwork 28-day periods, was not overweight and had normal insulin levels. When I hit my 30s, however, everything started going haywire. My fasting glucose and long-term glucose levels recently came back normal, but I'm now on the high side of normal weight and my periods are coming every 24-25 days.

I was diagnosed with PCOS after having irregular periods, I once went 15 months without one! Other than that I don\\'t have any major symtoms, maybe i have more hair than normal on my arms, belly and upper lip but then again I do have dark hair and I know women who are like that and don\\'t have PCOS! What the doctor told me was that I needed a blood test which showed a higher level of testosterone than normal and then sent me for a scan. Nothing was shown on that scan so the doctor sent me to a gynacologist who asked me certain question, gave me another scan and then diagnosed PCOS!

These are not cysts but they are eggs that have not hatched and back up in your ovaries - kind of like a traffic jam.  The ultrasound will show a \"string of pearls\" confirming the condition.  PCOS tends to cause insulin sesitivity so can be the reason for the weight gain - though, you are also right, the winter hibernation patterns of females (snacking after starving yourself during bikin season) can also be the reason.\\nWhat can be done to get \"traffic\" moving again so to speak? And what does the backed up egg have to do with getting a period so late or not at all? I\\'m assuming that if I got a period, then the egg dropped?\\n\\nIs some hormone not released when the egg is not released? I guess I am trying to figure out where signals are getting crossed. I also don\\'t want to be thrown onto bc just because that\\'s what \"all the doctors do\"  for people with pcos. It\\'s my understanding that bc will suppress ovulation, which will then reduce the incidence of more cysts forming. But the period that one gets on bc is not a real period--just a withdrawal bleed., with side effects. I guess I am not interested in suppressing my ovulation....just getting it moving again. Does this make sense?',\n",

Basically, you really have to limit the amount of bread, pasta, potatoes you eat.  At my appointment yesterday the doc said the biggest pitfalls for most people seem to be soda and ice cream.  I don't deprive myself of everything but if we have potatoes, I only take a little and I don't make a ton so we have lots of leftovers.  I might eat the bun on a hamburger but have veggies instead of fries.  I've lost 8 lbs being on metformin.  I read on another thread that it is really important to not completely cut out the carbs, rather to limit the amount of refined sugars you are eating. Hope this helps!\\nSara\\nmattysmamma~ thank you!  That is a real encouragement.  Im so sorry about your mc's.  But im so glad that the metformin worked for you...I hope I will have the same luck.  Im going to pick up my prescription tomorrow, so I am feeling a lot better about it now.\\n\\nconfrustrated~  thank you for the tip!  It definately helps me.  I have just really been freaking out about it.  That does make sense though to cut back on the carbs and really limit your sugar intake.  What about fruit, I know that they have natural sugar but do they need to be limited also?\\nI wouldn't worry too much about the fruit because like you said, it is natural and not refined sugar. I'm sure there are people who will tell you that you shouldn't eat too much but like they say, everything in moderation! You are picking up a prescription for metformin?  My experience is that it made me feel really crappy at first. It will most likely upset your stomach and maybe even give you diarrhea (sp).  For your stomach, make sure you eat something, even just a little something, or drink a glass of milk with your pills.  This will really help with the icky feeling.  I've gotten to where I can take a pill on an empty stomach so eventually you will get used to it. It might take even a couple months before you are tolerant of it though.  I think any time you try and 'diet' you set yourself up 1.) high expectations or  2.) a lot of times theres too much pressure.  My advice is just be aware of the food choices you make, don't deprive yourself of things, and know that you are making a good effort!!\\nSara\\nbtw - these are from my niece...shes sharing the chair with me and loves these lol so here ya go\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHi!

Good for you for dropping that doc who said just deal with it. Is your current dr a reproductive endocrinologist?

Best of luck to you, em\\nI too developed PCOS after Depo.  I too began Depo after the birth of my 1st child.  I had no problems whatsoever prior to Depo and have all sorts of problems.  You definately aren't alone!\\nI always had issues with my period in that I didn't start until age 16 and never had a regular cycle.  I went on Depo and that is when the real problems began.  Weight gain, extra hair and wild sex drive... come to find out that my tetestorone was 4x the norm.  Anyway - I think that Depo aggravated something that was probable handling itself quite well.  I got pregnant without trying before going on Depo.  Now I can't even ovulate on my own.

Your help is appreciated.  Thanks!\\n\\nWell, first of all......if you have insurance, and they allow it......I would see a Reproductive Endocrinologist.  They specialize in infertility and hormonal syndromes such as PCOS and would be able to better assist you in conception.\\n\\nInfertility is just one of the problems that come with PCOS.  You should see a specialist not only to conquer that, but the rest of the problems as well.......which is why I recommend a specialist.  OB/GYN's do not specialize in PCOS and often they do not know the best treatment options out there.  Every woman is different.  PCOS can affect people in so many different ways, which is why a specialist would be better suited for any woman with PCOS because they treat every woman individually.\\n\\nI have PCOS and did have success after 4 months of Clomid.  Best wishes to you.\\n\\nThanks for the info.  I will look into that.\",\n",

       " {'post': \"hey all ive had no period for 6 months now im also pcos and hypothyroid. Ive been on metformin 3months now no results and i can never loose weight. please help plus im insulin resistance, but this is the thing i take my metformin off and on, because i get to much diahreea when i take it, so maybe i take it 1 time a week. I havent taken it consistently for 3motnhs. so please help thanks\\nBlue,\\nI had never had a period and I'm almost 23. I was put on provera with no luck, and then prometrium to induce a bleed. I started metformin at the same time and also went on birth control.  I stopped the birthcontrol end of November because of the way it made me feel. I skipped a December period, I think because my body had to regulate itself without the me taking the pill. So Jan 1st my period showed up.  I went to the doc yesterday and he said that hopefully the metformin will continue to work.  I have also lost 8 lbs on pretty much the same diet I followed before; makes me wonder if I could lose more if I just changed up the diet a little!\\nSo anyways, in all of this what I'm trying to tell you is that maybe you need to ask your doctor about provera or prometrium.\\nGood luck!\\nSara\\nWhat do those last two meds help with? i aint loosing weight on the metformin or getting my periods, but im also on psychiatric meds, so maybe thats why i dont get my periods. i have pcos, hypothyroidism and insulin resistance. I wonder whats the best med for ll that. Plus i have the hair growth all over my body chin, sideburns, moustachce, breasts and stomach. What would be a good med for all these issues? thanks\\nThe provera and prometrium were used on me to induce a period.  I tried the provera first and it didn't work so I tried the prometrium. I also have the insulin resistance, thats what the metformin is for.  And I take synthroid for my underactive thryoid.  I'm also hairy and I hate it. It grows on my upper lip, chin, breasts, hands...it would be easier to tell you where I don't have hair lol\\nI don't really do much for my hair, but I do shave my upper lip and my chin. I have sensitive skin so I can't use a hair remover and getting it professionally removed isnt financially possible.  Have you discussed with your doctor that you aren't getting your periods on the metformin?  Also, do you follow a low carb diet?  I don't follow anything like South Beach or Atkins, but I try to watch what I eat.  I don't eat a lot of breads or pasta or sweets. You should also avoid soda and ice cream. Refined sugars are what is really bad for you here, but the natural sugars in fruit is alright.  Are you on something for your thryoid?\\nYea thats my problem because i have the insulin resistance im always craving sugar constantly. i can never loose weight im 250. im on synthroid for my thyroid problem. im just worried i wont be able to have a kid because i never get my periods and get all this hair. another thing i have is bipolar its a mental disorder and being on those meds have caused me all these problems, because the psychiatric meds screw with ur hormones and ur body produces testerone instead of estrogen and u also get high levels of prolactin. I just aint sure what med to take. i see a new endocrinologist next month so we will see what happens. i need to loose this weight. my diet is always strange sometimes healthy sometimes i eat garbage. i need a perosnal trainer and i also need laser hair removal but all mad expensive i cant afford it.\",\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi!\\n\\nMy friend from high school has PCOS.  She has one child that she conceived with the help of fertility treatments.  She is very overweight, and seems to blame it on the PCOS.  She doesn't watch what she eats and only has done cardio in the past.  She seems to think it's all because of the PCOS.  I'm just curious how much is inevitable and how much is her using the PCOS as an excuse.\\nIf a person eats poorly/unhealthy and they don't excercise, then they are more likely to gain weight.  PCOS can make the weight problem worse because of insulin resistance and a lower metabolism.\\n\\nHowever, it should be noted that carrying more weight is a symtom of PCOS and not everyone suffers from it.   Just like not everyone has hirsutism.\\n\\nIMHO, though, if a person spends their time blaming something else for what is going on with them, then they are not ready to own their own issues.  Also, you cannot make your friend change her ways or see the light.  It can be very hard to watch someone you love hurt themselves but in the end, they belong to themselves.\\n\\nBest Wishses\\ni have always been very active and eat very healthily i have no sugary foods and do not allow them in the house as my neice is diabetic and comes to stay regularly i eat mainly fruit and veg with a little meat and until last week little carbs ive cut them out now ive always been conscious of my weight as ive been overweight since my late teens i put on 4 stone in one month last year just before i found out i had pcos so far this year ive only managed to lose 1 stone and my doc wants me to lose 4 more stones before i can have clomid ive been to a dietician which didnt help as i already do everything she said and work out 30mins everyday on top of a very active lifestyle i have insomnia and only sleep for 2 or 3 hours a night the rest of the time im finding things to do so far today ive cleaned the house from top to bottom , painted the bathroom and given the garden a complete makeover ive started taking supplements and havent weighted mysef for two weeks so hope they help i desperately need to lose weight in order to get clomid as we really want a baby can anyone help? my whole family are big and my partner is not he eats loads\\nI was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 15. I'm now 22 and am by no means overweight. I was fairly chubby as a child and therefore have watched my weight ever since high school. The biggest i've been since I was around 15 is a size 12, but then I suffered from an eating disorder and went down to a size 6. Luckily, I'm now a healthy size 10, I exercise (or try to!) 3 times a week, eat a healthy diet with a few treats now and then so I don't think having PCOS has affected my weight at all. I am scared however that one day I'll suddenly balloon and won't be able to get rid of the weight but hopefully that won't be the case.\\n\\nHope this helps?\\n\\nI was diagnosed with PCOS back in 2001.  PCOS does sometimes cause weight gain.  For me, most of it is in my midsection.  Last November I wore a size 22!!!  I didn't eat healthy, didn't exercise or anything.  I began walking in November and by April of this year, I was down to a size 14!!!!!  Just from walking.  So, I truly believe that with diet and exercise........anyone can lose weight.  PCOS may make it harder to lose weight, but it can be done.\\n\\nI too beleive that blaming weight issues on PCOS is an excuse for some.  If a person eats poorly, doesn't exercise..........that isn't helping matters.\\nWell, I just wanted to post that for a lot of PCOS sufferers they do have wight issues.  Most are not seriously obese.. but heavy.  I have been, but I have PCOS severely.  There are also other issues with PCOS like insulin resistance and thyriod issues as well as vitamin and mineral deficiencies.  Many women with PCOS have reactive hypoglycemia.  So yes, PCOS does make weight loss hard and weight gain easy.  You should watch what you eat but that is hard.  For most people that is very hard.  Especially for the women who want to conceive and cannot.  When you are already depressed it is hard to exercise, and diet.  So don't be to hard on your friend.  You never know what other issues she may have, and honestly she may not either.\\nI think maybe she might blame everything on PCOS but its probbaly the weight problem that made her have PCOS , im not sure as i dont know her but speaking from experience i used to use PCOS excuse for everything and just ignored sorting the problem out , but now im better.  I have lost weight but in the wrong way i have lost weight fast because i have not eaten much in the past 2 weeks as i felt sooooo ill and i just didnt feel like it. I feel better now though but i have reached my target of losing 1 stone.\\n\\nAs for your friend maybe you should talk to her but i agree with what these said , its her life her problem!  u have ur own life to lead honey!\\n\\nxxxx\",\n",

Im in the uk and my doc hinted that pcos is still fairly new n still relatively misunderstood. Just wanna hear from anyone who might be better informed on it than I am! Any input much appreciated, thanks.\\nHi messy,\\n\\n\\nThe little bit that I know about PCOS might help. I was dx 18 months ago, and have had a real battle with it. I haven't had AF for 10 months. I'm actually going to the doctors tomorrow to sort things out. (will let you know how I go)...\\n\\nFirst thing we both need to do is to induce AF (period). I have read from other posts that taking Provera, can bring on a period. The first one is going to be a hum-dinger as I haven't had one for so long. Once the cycle is regulated, I'm not sure how long to take Provera for, but I will find out tomorrow, then we need to work out dates of ovulation. If after some time there is still no pregnancy, Clomid is the next step. I have taken Clomid on several occasions, but, my Gyno didn't inform me that I need to have a regular, proper cycle before I take Clomid. He knew my whole history and still put me on it. Obviously it didn't work and when I did fall preg while on it, the egg wasn't right as I hadn't ovulated properly and I m\\\\c.\\nI recommened you get a referal to go and see a Gyno and take the steps from there.\\n\\nI lost 25lb in hope that it would regulate things, but, it only made me feel fitter and look a little skinnier. (I was 194lb and I'm now 169lb) 88kg - 77kg.\\n\\nI did read that if you can lose 10% of your body weight, that is a good start to regulating things.

Well, when we got home...... AF had visited and she looks like staying this time!! I'm so excited\\n\\nI'm keeping track of it and if I don't get it again next month, I will be going to the doctors to see if I should take Provera to bring it on. But, hopefully I won't have to do that. (with my history, anything can happen though)\\nIf I can get some sort of pattern, then we can work out if and when I'm ovulating. First things first though.\\n\\nLoads of love to you\\nLeanne....\\n\\nMessy,\\n\\nI have about the same problem as you.  I started my period for the first time in 9th grade.  After that, I had a period every month, then every other month, and then I went a whole summer with no period.  Since then (15 years) I do not have my own period.  Doctors have been telling me that it is not safe to go without a period for more than 3 months.  It ups the risks for uterine cancer.  When was 21, my husband and I decided to have a child.  But how could I?  I didn't get a period.  The doctor put me on chlomid and then did transvaginal ultrasounds until my folicle looked big enough for ovulation.  Since I didn't ovulate, they then had to give me a shot of estrogen.  My husband and I had to have intercourse every morning and every night for a week.  It worked first month out.\\nIt wasn't enough just to use chlomid....I had to get the shot to induce the ovulation.  The doctor said that I would probably go back to normal after the birth.  Well, I didn't.  I still do not get a period and my cysts are worse.\\nMy mom had the same thing, but back then, they did surgery and scrapped the cysts off.  She had 5 babies after that.\\nHope this helps.\\n\\nHi Messy.........unfortunately many of us have experienced infertility with PCOS.  So, you will find some good advice on here as to what you can do.  As for me...........when I went to see a specialist to get pregnant, I was immediately put on Clomid.  I didn't have to have my period induced by Provera first.  I hadn't had a period for 5 years when I began using the Clomid.  I got pregnant after 4 months of using Clomid.  What type of doctor are you seeing?  You should be seeing a Reproductive Endocrinologist, if you already aren't.\",\n",

Doctors are not all the same.  Also I wrote a response to Kitten Paws and it covers a lot more info than just the doctors crap of lose weight.  That is stupid.  Read mine I have had this since I was 10, when I started my periods.  How old is the young girl???  Tell her not to feel so bad.  I am now 27 so I have been dealing with this for 17 years.  I can let her know some of the things that I have done to help myself and also how I have coped with the frustration and depression with the rudeness and stupidity of some doctors.  But make sure to read my response to Kitten Paws, it covers a lot of the things that she should have checked that can help.\\nI would get a second opinion.  My daughter had cysts OUTside her ovaries.  They were able to drain them and remove them without dealing with the ovaries themselves.  OK, she is overweight, ok she is a smoker.  She had them out at age 18.  She said she has felt small ones pop.  My other daughter has a friend who is sssskkkkkkkiiiiinnnnnyyyyy.  She had them too.  So weight doesn\\'t always factor into it.  The important thing is to get the cysts drained and removed.  The one my daughter had was there for several years and once we checked into it, it had become 10 cc.  That\\'s roughly the size of a new baby\\'s head in circumference. That was the size across.  It wasn\\'t that big all over.  They made an incision just above both of her hips and drained it and pulled it out.  Recovery was relatively fast and not that painful.\\nI too went through the same thing when I was diagnosed. I was going to this specialist and all he said was.. lose weight and it will stop.. then we would spend the rest of the 30 min slot talking aboput anything other than pcos... Yes.. losing weight will help with it, but its not the cure.. i dont care what any dr. says.. I have lost weight and still having problems with it. As for your friend having the facial hair, talk to her abpout asking her dr. about vanique. It worked wonders for me... I would also tell her oto do her own research on PCOS.. thats how i found out my info... the dr.s didnt help me at all... And as for having kids... My cousin, who also has PCOS, was also told that she will never have kids, and now have a baby girl who is 2 and a baby boy who is 3 months... So tell her not to worry about the kids deal right now... worry about it when it comes.. There are plenty of things they can do for that in the long run.\\n\\n\\nFirst and foremost..........she needs to get a new doctor.  She should go to a specialist, preferable an Endocrinologist or even a Reproductive Endocrinologist.  I know that she probably isn\\'t planning on having children now, but since infertility often runs hand in hand with PCOS, seeing an RE wouldn\\'t be a bad idea if she does plan on having children someday.\\n\\nWeight loss does NOT cure PCOS.  As a matter of fact, NOTHING can cure PCOS.  Sometimes losing weight can make controlling PCOS easier, but does NOT cure it.\\n\\nAs for children..........you will find many women on here, myself included, who have PCOS and children!!!  It is not impossible.  Many of us, again myself included, have experienced infertility, but infertility oftentimes can be overcome!\\n\\nDo your friend a big favor.............and introduce her to these boards.  I have been a part of these boards for quite some time, and there is no better place to go for advice.  In my experience with doctors, their info is oftentimes biased.  They\\'re trying to make money.  They\\'re trying to introduce drugs for pharmaceutical companies............so you cannot always trust that the info they\\'re giving you is fact.  You can\\'t go wrong with these boards................talking with people who have walked in your shoes is far more comforting than talking with someone who hasn\\'t been there.  Also the people on these boards are living proof that her doctor is wrong!!!',\n",

I was having irregular periods (if that's what you call them) and was spotting most of the time with no real ovulation.\\n\\nMy doctor gave me a prescription for Metformin (500 mg 4x daily), YAZ birth control pills, and 10 days of Provera.\\n\\nI was told to start taking these medications all at once.\\n\\nSo on August 4th I started the metformin (starting with 500 mg at first), the YAZ birth control pills, and then the provera.\\n\\nOn the second day of the medication, I started to bleed heavily.  I knew that the Provera was going to do this, and I expected maybe a week of bleeding.  Well after finishing all 10 provera pills, the bleeding became far worse.  Having to change pads every hour.  It was a horrible mess.  I called the doctors office and they said to just keep doing what I was doing, that it was normal.\\n\\nSince then, I have continued to bleed with no real signs of it going away.  I finished my first YAZ birth control pack yesterday 9/10 and started a new pack today 9/11.\\n\\nThis past week it seemed like it was lightening up and almost ready to go away...but now it seems to be coming back with a vengence.  I have no idea if this is normal or what.  Is THIS supposed to be aunt flo?\\n\\nOn the Yaz bcp's - you take the active pills for 24 days - and then the inactive pills for 4 days.  Is this when aunt flo comes?  I just feel like this red river will never go away.

I took it for 5 days, 1 tablet a day.  On the third day after I had finished taking them (16/09/06), I had AF.\\nIt has just about finished now (26/09/06).\\nI had a hell of a time with AF because it been such a long time since my last one.  I had MASSIVE clots and HUGE amounts of bleeding, which resulted in having to change my pads every half an hour coz they where FULL!  I took folic acid to keep my iron levels stable, so I didn't end up anemic, and so far I have been ok.\\nIt totally drained my body and I never thought it was going to end but, luckily it is nearly there now and I'm just hoping that AF come next month but not as bad as she did this time!\\nI would imagine your body is just adjusting to the different meds you are taking, it will sort itself out.  If you feel it is not getting any better within the next week, go back to your doctor and explain to them what is going on.\\nHe may put you on Provera while you are bleeding, to reduce the bleeding.  Yes that might sound crazy, but, it is also used to stop bleeding, I had to have it after a huge bleed that I had that went for 9 weeks. I took it for about 8 days and it stopped.  Was relief I can tell ya!!!\\nWell darl, I hope this has helped you, let me know how you go...\\nAll the best to you...\\n****Leanne****\\n\",\n",

Since I was about 14 or 15 I have developed what I would call excess hair on my stomach, lower back and thighs.  I have just ignored it and my partner doesn't care about it but then more symptoms started to show.  For the past year or so I have had semi irregular cycles (ranging generally between 30 and 37 days).  My partner and I don't have sex during ovulation time but as my cycle isn't overly regular this isn't the easiest task so I thought I'd go and see the dr about going on the pill.  As soon as I started talking to him he suggested PCOS and I've had bloodtests and waiting for an ultrasound appointment.  I go back to my doctor in two weeks to discuss the bloodtests (including different hormone levels, cholesterol and blood sugar levels).  I am a little overweight but this is also genetic.  I have read that PCOS can be genetic and as far as I know noone in my family has had it.  My partner is very supportive and equally interested in whether my symptoms do lead to PCOS.  We want to start have children when we are about 25 or 26 (currently 22) but if this is PCOS then wonder if we should try sooner (is there more chance when your younger?)\\n\\nI know that being a bit hairy can be a sign of PCOS as can irregular periods and being overweight however I have had extra hair since puberty while my semi-irregular periods have only been for the last year or so which coincides with a stressful year as university.  I sometimes have slight pain during ovulation times, and a bit of pain and tender breasts right before my period and into the first day or so (the joy of PMS?).  My period always lasts about 6-7 days and isn't over heavy but isn't light.  I have never missed a period.  I don't suffer from mood swings.

Up until about a year ago I was trying various medications to help this to no avail, one being sodium valporate which I have seen can cause the symptoms of PCOS to show (or something along those lines).\\n\\nSorry this has been a large thread but I was wondering what you people think, could this be PCOS or could it just be hirsutism or perhaps excess androgens without being PCOS and my irregular periods (of which the last on over holidays was only 29 days, back to what it was before becoming irregular) be related to stress?\\n\\nMany thanks\\n\\nBeks\",\n",

I am completly new to this but have read many of the previous threads with great interest as it is always nice to get firsthand impressions and experiences instead of what the doctors might have read. I have not been diagnosed with PCOS but am in the process awaiting bloodtests and scanning. What I have read about PCOS and the symptoms of the condition was what made me go to the GP to get a test, but... I do not have irregular periods as yet. They are heavy and painfull but still come with regular intervals. Anyone diagnosed with PCOS who has the same??  As I said I am new to this so please bare with me if I have violated any thread rules.\\n\\nHiya,\\n\\nI was dx with pcos about a month ago whilst having tests for infertility done.\\nI too have heavy painful but regular periods (well sort of regular, i have 2 a month) but they do last for about 10 days at a time. Having read some posts this really doesn't sound like i have pcos at all??? I am sooo confused. Can anyone else shed any light on this.\\n\\nThanks\\nI do have PCOS and almost all the problems that go with (unfortunatly)... Some of the sympotms are... Heavy and painfull periods (but this could also be endometriosis), extra hair (like on face, chest, stomach etc.), thinning hair, darkened skin on arms, neck, chest, and also glucose problems, and weight gain. Not saying all of it comes along with PCOS.... but those are the most common problems... Hope to hear from you soon! Good luck and god bless\\nMiranda\\nI too have severe PCOS with many symptoms.  I would say that lack of period is more common in PCOS women than heavy periods, but it can go either way.  If you have no other symptoms besides heavy long periods, then I would say to be checked for endo.  If you do have some of the other classic symptoms for PCOS, then your testing is heading in the right direction.  Here are some of my symptoms:\\n\\nIrregular or no periods at all.\\nHair growth...........in\\nof the unwanted areas.\\nType 2 Diabetes\\nWeight gain\\nHair loss.........used to have a head of very thick hair.........now it's very thin!\\nInfertility\\nDarkened skin in certain areas (neck, armpits)\\ni just had an u/s showing polycystic ovaries on cd10 on my last cycle, but he used the term PCOS, but i don't understand how at 31 and having gone through fertility treatment beofre, it could just pop up now??? not back then even only 14 mo ago?? iam confused.\\n\\ni have heavy painful periods, they are mostly all regular except this month she came 8 days late. hoping i was pregnant but nope. my dr told me not to worry, but how can i not, iam ttc? sounds pretty serious, but iam still not convinced. iam going tomorrow for blood work, and the whole nine yards from an RE specialist, that may give me my answers.\\n\\ni don't have acne, excess hair, iam underweight rather then over, and iam shown to ovulate every month. i don't know, if this diagnosis is right or something else, but i'll keep you posted. it does have me scared though.\\n\\nhugs, sherry\",\n",

I'm hoping that metformin and diet help. I just get depressed thinking that I will have to take this med for the rest of my life.\\n\\nNo, not everyone with PCOS is doomed to become Diabetic.  Not everyone with PCOS is even doomed to become IR.  PCOS and IR often run hand in hand, and if IR is NOT treated properly, it can lead to diabetes.  There is a different test to determine if you have IR or not.  So, if diabetes is ruled out, make sure that IR is as well since if not treated properly, it can lead to diabetes.  I am a diabetic, but I was diagnosed 5 years before I was diagnosed with PCOS.  Diabetes runs heavily in my family, so I may have just gotten it because it was in the cards for me, however I'm not sure.\\n\\nMetformin is often prescribed to PCOS patients even if they are NOT IR or Diabetic because Metformin does a great job of regulating hormones, leading to more regular periods, sometimes weight loss and conception as well.\",\n",

Good luck and god bless\\nMiranda\\nLike the others have said, Metformin does work differently for everyone, BUT it can make a big difference.  One of the reasons that Met was introduced to women with PCOS is because doctors have found that many PCOS women are also Insulin Resistant.  So, Met was originally used to treat the IR in women.  Then it was discovered that even for women who are not IR, the Met still does the same job.  It regulates the hormones, often times leading to easier weight loss, more regular periods, and sometimes conception.  Regulation of hormones is also key in controlling IR and stopping it from developing into Diabetes.  So, basically to answer your question, depending if it works for you or not, you could see results in more ways than one.\\ni have started taking them,, on my 3rd week now,,\\n\\nI cant seem to go upto 3 tabs a day.(1500mg)  I was really sick last week,\\n\\nI feel scared to go upto 3 tabs.. but at the same time,,, I am so desperate to lose some weight..\\nI took 850mg 2x a day for a year.

These are 2 different things.  Polycystic ovaries is really just one symptom of pcos.  Just because you have that one symptom, does not mean you have the actual syndrome.  Diagnosis would be determined by blood tests - in particular - testosterone, fsh and lh, and perhaps fasting insulin levels.  The name of pcos is misleading since ovarian cysts are not the hallmark of the condition, and many endocrinolgists now call it an excess androgen disorder rather than simply pcos.  I actually have the syndrome based on blood tests but have never had cysts that I\\'m aware of.  HOpe this helps and good luck to you!\\ni think you are right, cause yesterday i saw a RE specialist, and he is 99.9% certain i don\\'t have pcos. he did an u/s, and this time, there was no cysts to be found, and iam waiting on my blood test results. i had to push him to do them, that is how secure he is. on the other hand, i do have painful heavy periods, though regular, and he\\'s about 80% sure i have endo, which is what i was thinking. i don\\'t really want a lap cause it sounds painful, and the scares to (sorry to sound vain), he says it can just come back likely anyway, then what? so we shall see, it\\'s eigther deal with the pain or get a lap, but he doesn\\'t think my blood tests will show pcos. i think my obgyn jumped the gun there.  hugs\\n',\n",

I don\\'t have an appetite, and I can\\'t eat hardly at all when I am feeling extremely nauseated which is usually in the evening.  Has anyone else been really nauseated on the Metformin and if so did it \"eventually\" pass, or how did you handle it???  Thanks.\\nHi, I was diagnosed with pcos and for about 3mos. also took 1000mg of metformin as treatment for infertility. I was very nauseated, also felt shaky and sick during that time. Unfortunately for me these symptoms did not improve so I went off the metformin and decided to take a break from fertility treatments. My dr tested my blood sugar and it was normal, but he did say there were alternatives to metformin-I never asked what they were.\\nEveryone is different so hopefully your symptoms will pass, maybe you could have your sugar checked or talk to your dr about alternatives. I am restarting fertility treatments soon and am sort of dreading going back on metformin. Good luck to you!\\naspiditis...I am on 2000 mg of metformin..and yes I was very nauseaus for about a month.  It finally went away and I can take 2000 mg on am empty stomach and it doesn\\'t phase me...hang in there...it should go away soon.  If you have to try going back down to 500 mg and working your way up.  Or take a 500 in the am and 500 in the pm.  Let me know how it works out for you\\n\\nAfter reading your post I just realized I am no longer nauseau on Metffromin.  I use to not be able to eat anything and that has alas come to pass - took about 6 weeks so hang in there!\\nWhen I first started on Metformin I couldn\\'t keep anything down. I started by eating something bland and starchy when I took the meds...toast or crackers. Then, I\\'d something small about 2 hours later...yogurt and crackers or pretzels, sometimes soup. Having that little something on my stomach helped. Now, I can take it with whatever. I hope this helps!\\nWell, I am now not on the Metformin at all.  I wasn\\'t eating much, and then I got really sick, I ended up going to the ER 3 days in a row and had pneumonia.  I stopped everything.  I am back on my thyroid, and am starting back on the 500 metformin today.  I am also going to the doc for a ACTH test because we suspected adrenal components and when I was in the hospital with pneumonia they gave me prednisone and I felt good on it.  So maybe that will benefit me.  I just think I will try 500 mg for about 6 weeks then try 500 am and then  500 pm and see how that does.  I just don\\'t want to be so tired.  One plus side to the pneumonia, I was so sick I couldn\\'t eat anything at all, and I lost 8 pounds!!!! Hell of a way to do it but at least there was some upside to it, and then I also got a period, first one in 8 months!!!!  So all in all, maybe it was a good thing.  Thanks for all of your replies, I really feel better knowing that other people have had the same experience and for most of you it passed.',\n",

Doctor goes we want to take blood tests and vaginal ultrasound before you can get it, Im like ok then, So I get all the tests done, I was horrified, upset cried, YOU HAVE PCOS, Im like what the hell is PCOS it means you have an infertility problem, you will need drugs you cant fall pregnant without hormone drugs, I went home and cried and cried, I felt depressed, I knew I had always been overweight even to morbid obesity and I guess finally I had a reason why, I didnt feel so helpless in that respect.\\n\\nI felt like crying everytime, I saw a women with a new baby or child, So I decided to go healthy, go low g.i. take vitamins excercise a little more as I didnt do any went back to the doctors, said to her even if I change all this will I get pregnant, NO you will never get pregnant without Hormonal drugs.\\n\\nSo I thought ok maybe just maybe if this is what I have to do Im willing to risk it, CLomid there is 40 % increased chance of miscarriage, 40% increased rate of getting cervical cancer, I thought well its worth it if I get to hold my baby in my arms.\\n\\nSo I was at work one day and a lady came into see me and she asked me something, she said do you beleive in GOD I said kind of I guess, She said well Im catholic ( so is my husband ) and she said can I Give you something, I said OK she said I want to give you a picture of The virgin mary and baby jesus this picture is a copy of a very very old picture which was blessed in Romania by a catholic priest I have this picture for you blessed by a catholic priest and I also want to give you a pendant with the virgin mary on it,She said wear it all the time never take it off and ask mary and the baby jesus everyday to bless you with a baby.\\n\\nWITHIN THE MONTH I KIDD YOU NOT I prayed and Iasked and I begged The Virgin mary to bless me with a baby and within the month I was pregant, NO DRUGS, NO IVF, NO MUMBO JUMBO, For someone who has never been a beleiver I was, I have a beautiful gorgeous 9 month old son he was born on the 2/2/06, he is my little miracle he is my pride and joy.\\n\\nThis women told me for every women she gave this picture to she got pregnant and had a boy.

I have quite a few questions and I can\\'t seem to be able to get a straight answer from anyone.\\n\\nBackground info: I\\'m 20 years old. I\\'m 5\\'5 and 120 lbs (all my weight is in my breasts and on my abdomen). I\\'m currently taking the birth control pill Yaz, which has helped my acne and regulates my period. I have no facial hair. My doctor is sending me a prescription for metformin.\\n\\nQuestions:\\n\\n1. Everything I read suggests that I need to lose weight in order to control my insulin resistance. If I am already a healthy weight, do I need to lose any? I work incredibly hard to keep my weight where it is. I practically eat nothing and I exercise daily.\\n\\n2. If I start taking Metformin, will it help to redistribute my body fat, or am I stuck with a beer belly and stick legs for the rest of my life?\\n\\n3. I am a vegan and I have no desire to change this. I have been to a dietician and I was very unhappy with that experience. She told me I need to start eating meat. Is this going to be an issue for me? I will NOT start eating meat, dairy or eggs.\\n\\n4. Are there any long term side effects from taking Metformin?\\n\\n5. Will it help stop type 2 diabetes from developing?\\n\\nThank you everyone so much.\\nPlease if anyone has any ideas about any of my questions can you please help? I\\'m stuck in a rut here. I\\'ve posted on so many internet boards and no one ever replies.\\nWell, the only things I can say are that as far as the metformin it will help to regulate your sugar and some hormones so you will have regular periods without Yaz, and since the abdominal fat is from the insulin resistance the Metformin may help you lose the \"beer belly.\"  If I were you I would find a nutritionist who can work with you on a good diet that will work both for you being a vegan and having insulin resistance.  Although being insulin resistant you are making things worse if you are eating mostly carbs.  If you would be willin to be vegetarian insted of vegan that would be healthier for you.  BUT that is your choice and you just need to find someone who can work with you whatever you decide.  The problem with eating carbs is that they turn to sugar quickly stressing you body with more insulin which your body isn\\'t using well anyway and then your body stores that fat in your belly.  But as you said if you are happy and will not consider changing just find someone who will understand and not be upset with you as you said the other person was.

You should be seeing a Reproductive Endocrinologist in you aren't already.  This way you could ensure that you're receiving the right treatment.........and I can tell you that birth control alone is NOT the right treatment.  BCP only mask the problems of PCOS.........the only thing that BCP do is regulate your period........aside from that, they do absolutely nothing.  You should also be taking something else to try to regulate your hormones as well.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I\\'ve left a couple of messages on this board asking for information about PCOS as I have just been diagnosed a few weeks ago, after almost 8 months of trying to conceive.\\n\\nI just wanted to say thanks so much for your support! It means the world to me. Every internet site I go on about PCOS says that it can cause infertillity, and since my husband and I have been trying to conceive for so long, I felt like I would never be able to have kids.\\n\\nIt\\'s so nice to read positive messages. It gives me hope.\\n\\nMy doctor told me to lose weight and everything would return to normal, but I have heard that it\\'s not true, and I should be going on medication. I\\'ve decided to give the weight loss a try, and see if anything changes. If nothing gets better within a month or two, I will go with option number two (the drugs).\\n\\nI started the weight watchers diet 2 and a half weeks ago, aswell as using my stepper or walking every day, and so far, I have lost 2kg!\\n\\nI\\'ve still got a long way to go (I have to lose another 13kg at least), but at least it\\'s a start!\\n\\nI\\'ll no doubt be back here almost every day just to feel I\\'m not alone, and to keep reminding myself that people have had positive outcomes, so if anyone has overcome infertillity, or gotten over PCOS altogether, it would be great to read a message from you!\\n\\nThanks again guys, just knowing you\\'re there is making this awful time in my life a lot more manageable.\\nTry Metformin I took It 500mg 3x aday for 10 months and my baby is due begginning of oct good luk\\nHang in there sweetie! I had ovarian cysts in my teenage years and my sister suffers from PCOS as well. I have kids now and my sister is trying to get pregnant now and the doctor told her that she thinks she will conceive eventually....it just may take some time. If it makes you feel any better, my best friend tried for 2 years to get pregnant. And she has no female problems at all, it just took a while. She now has 3 kids. You\\'ll get there.....just don\\'t ever give up hope! We\\'re all here to support you\\n\\nI usually don\\'t post here but I do read the boards. I have had PCOS for 25 years now. I am 41 now. I had a hard time getting pregnant because of it. It took me 5 years to have my son. I had to have surgery on the ovaries to get pregnant with him. I had tried all of the meds with no help. He is now 12 years old. Then it took me another 5 years to have my daughter who is now 6 years old. (same surgery I had with my son) I have had 5 pregnancy total. Hang in there. I did not think I would ever have children. It was a rough road to be on but I would not trade it for the world. I ended up having my kids later but, hey I took them when I could. I also had a great doctor who I trusted. I still see him because I have insulin resistance. I was told I would never have kids. Even the doctor I went to did not give much hope after my pathology reports from surgery came back. That same month of surgery I was pregnant with my son. Don\\'t give up hope yet! best of luck to you.\\n\\nElaine\\nI too had PCOS and my husband and I were off the pill for 5 years... then i went to a fertility doctor in june of 2005 and i got pregnate december of 2005... so i know it can and will more then likely happen for you... i am now half way through my pregnancy and i feel wonderful... we are expecting our first child the middle of september 2006... hope all goes well with you... i just took clomid and metformin along with folic acid of course... take care.\\nHi! I had trouble getting pregnant, too...took 2 yrs w/ my first, and almost as long w/ my second! We were trying to avoid doctors w/ the first, and I still don\\'t know why we conceived that time...the only thing we did differently was get rid of our heated water bed!\\n\\nThe second time, I was older and wasn\\'t willing to wait that long...had just had a couple of tests, and we became pregnant! I had no idea about cysts at that time and had been on the pill except for the time I was trying to conceive.  I have since be diagnosed with functional cysts that are an annoyance but are not bursting or causing me great pain.  My doctor says I probably had them all along, but the birth control pills were suppressing it.\\n\\nMy point is that even though I was not aware I had cysts while trying to conceive, I did have a test called a hystercalpenogram (spelling?) in which dye is injected into the fallopian tubes and a picture is displayed on a monitor.  The dye will show any blockages of the tubes.  My Dr. told me that often, women conceive right after having this procedure.  We said maybe it \"blasts the ovaries open\" and allows proper ovulation.  Well, that very month I became pregnant! I still think it was the procedure that kick-started my ovaries.\\n\\nNow, of course I am no expert, and I don\\'t want to suggest you ask for that test...but the test may be ordered as part of your infertility testing.  If that\\'s the case, who knows? maybe it could work for you!\\n\\nGood luck and I\\'ll say a prayer for you....\\nCarla\\nHI everyone~! I\\'m here to offer hope to those that have PCOS and are worried about TTC. I was officially diagnosed in 2003 - but I\\'ve known I had it since in HS when my periods were never regular.\\n\\nI was placed on Metformin ER (1,000mg) in Feb. 2004 and have been on it ever since. My husband and I weren\\'t using birth control during the past 2 years - but also not actively trying - by which I mean - we weren\\'t timing my ovulation day, etc.\\n\\nIn January, I got really serious about tracking my ovulation. I have 32 day cycles and found that I ovulate on day 21 almost every month. I used the OPKs and they worked great.\\n\\nI got pregnant in March after only 2 full cycles of actively trying. I must say I was very, very shocked. I thought it would take years.\\n\\nSo - please don\\'t worry and be positive. Metformin ER is a wonder drug. It allowed me to have monthly regular cycles for the first time in my life and allowed me to get pregnant. I am now 8 weeks and due in November!\\ni was diagnosed w/pcos @ 18  am now 42 and have 4 children; with the help of drugs; my docs always said lose weight and i too would be \"normal\"... lol  didnt happen; they cant figure out if the weight gain is b/c of the pcos or the pcos is because of the weight gain.  i know this... i had it when i was skinny, and the facial hair and gained the weight in early 20\\'s with 1-2 periods a year.... go figure.   anyway... hang in there there is definitely hope of conceiving.  good luck & God bless.\\nhi i have had PCOS all my life but i was only diagnosed a few montha ago as i hadnt had a period in a year and was experiencing pain. i was laughing when i found out it can stop fertility as i have a 1 year old son. it just seems to me that when your not thinking about it its much easier as my son wasnt planned but now i want a second one its taking forever. have you thought about taking CLOMID?\\nSame here, I was put on Metformin with no effect.  I was scheduled to see a fertility doctor but I got pregnant before I could see the doctor.\\n\\nIt took me a 1.5 years to conceive but I did.  All the time I was worried that I will not be able to conceive.  Amazingly!!!!\\n\\nI lost the twins at 24 weeks, got a period once and found out that I was pregnant again.  I am 11 weeks.\\n\\nTry not to worry about PCOS.  From all the stories I have heard.....conceiving will not be an issue.\\n\\nGood Luck\\ndont be disheartened. I was diagnosed with PCOS a couple of years ago, and without having lost weight or going on any medication i fell pregnant (not trying to though) after my first period in 2 years, although i have only had one period since my baby was born a year ago. Everyone is different and when you are supposed to get pregnant you will. I suggest you stop trying though... that is usually when you DO fall pregnant!\\nhi chickadee,\\ndont worry itz very commomn nowadays .ie.....,pcos.i was also diagnosed with pcos 6 months back and i am also trying to concieve since 1 year\\ni am also on metformin 1000 mg and clomid 100 mg.dont lose hope and i know itz very difficult to go through this even i get depressed many times but my dh always supports me......my many frenz have pcos and also have many childrens.....it was also difficult for them initially too.As for ur weight,dont strench urself too much try to enjoy walkin or exercising with some music...and diet.all the best for trying and plz pray for me also....itz nice to hear from people in the board....bye\\n',\n",

Oh and I just recently found this one out.  Did you know that when a woman orgasms after the male, the contractions help to pull the sperm into the vagina?

Periods are missed for months at a time, sometimes it comes down for 1 day, 3 hrs, 17 days, heavy, light (like spotting) it's crazy and I do not ovulate on my own (hence the reason for the Clomid)...\\nA tilted uterus does not affect fertility (or really anything else).  The only effects you'll probably ever notice are that OB/GYN exams could be a tad more uncomfortable if your doctor is insensitive or it's possible that certain sexual positions could be less comfortable for you.\\na tilted uterus is just another normal variety of the way the uterus lays inside! I was told I had one at my very first Gyn appt. at age 16. Not only do I have children, I get pregnant extremely easily! I also have mild endometriosis that caused a great deal of pain until I got on BC pills. Now, my period is very manageable and cramps are mild.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hello!  I was tentatively diagnosed with PCOS two months ago, in April, and was prescribed Yasmin (the 28-day cycle, beginning on Sunday).  I began taking it immediately, and was pleased to find last month that my period came exactly when it should have.  It was extremely heavy and lasted nearly two weeks, but I still felt better knowing all the tissue that was supposed to come out\\ncoming out -- finally!  Otherwise I\\'d be at greater risk for endometriosis and some cancers.  It was a relief for me.  But I have two questions:\\n\\nThis is my second placebo week; last Saturday was my last Yasmin dose until the next cycle.  My period still hasn\\'t arrived, and there is nothing -- no cramping or discharge -- to suggest it will begin anytime soon.  I\\'m not pregnant, and I don\\'t feel as if anything else is wrong.  Why am I not menstruating?\\n\\nI\\'ve also noticed since I began taking Yasmin that I get muscle tics/twitches (usually in my legs, but they can occur anywhere on my body, including my face).  The tics/twitches either occur just once and stop on their own, or go away when I touch them.  They also seem to lessen when I get plenty of exercise, as if the muscles become too tired to twitch.\\n\\nAdditionally, there has been some tingling in my forearms, hands, calves, and feet.  Actually, it\\'s not really tingling or \"pins and needles,\" and I haven\\'t experienced any numbness.  It\\'s more like an itchy prickling sensation, like I\\'m being bitten by a mosquito -- it\\'s just an itchy pinprick feeling occuring in only one spot each time.  This isn\\'t listed as a side-effect of Yasmin in any of the literature I\\'ve read, so what is it?\\n\\nI posted some messages on the \"Neuropathy\" message board already, but I don\\'t think anyone can relate.  I\\'m hoping someone here can put my mind at ease.\\n\\nThanks!\\nHi\\n\\nI have been taking yasmin for 4.5 yrs now for acne, excess hair, etc. For the first 3 yrs I only experienced bloating or mild depression.

I went to the doc's and he explained that all out to me, gave me some meds (diane and apo-cyprotherone).

It\\'s not on my face though (aside from a small amount of upperlip hair, but I\\'m Spanish and Italian, so what can you expect???  lol).  It\\'s not thick, and it\\'s not course... just DARK!  It\\'s almost like I have the normal \"peach fuzz,\" but it\\'s just darker than normal.  I\\'ve also had a small amount of hair thinning on my head.  Anyway, I\\'m under 16, I have very regular periods, I\\'m not overweight, I don\\'t have skin tags, I don\\'t have acne, etc., etc., etc., BUT both my mother and my aunt have had cysts on their ovaries!  (Not officially PCOS though.)\\n\\nThis brings me to my question: I\\'m going for a visit with an endocrinologist that specializes in pediactric hormone imbalances, and I\\'d like to know what the exam will entail.  I absolutely, 100%, without a doubt REFUSE to have any pelvic exam, internal outrasound, and/or genital examination... especially since this is a \"teaching hospital\" and there will be between 3 and 5 doctors present in the room.\\nThey can see all the hair they want, and take as much blood as I have to offer, but they\\'re staying the heck away from below the belt.  I read that if the patient is a virgin, they commonly opt to NOT do any sort of internal exams... is this true?  I\\'m definitely a virgin, and I mean I\\'m not trying to be too descriptive here, but even using tampons can be painful for me, so I don\\'t even know how they could physically fit an outrasound metal thing inside of me.\\n\\nIs it a waste of time to even go (because this is all that the exam would consist of), or are there other ways to test for PCOS and other hormone imbalances?  Also, have any of you had similar hesitancies about going to a doctor about this sort of thing?  To say that I\\'m modest would officially qualify as the understatement of the century.\\n\\n\\nThanks for any help or advice!\\nJust relax\\n, I don\\'t think you will need a pelvic exam and I\\'m pretty sure the doctor will not need to look at your genitals, since there is really no way of detecting PCOS with a pelvic exam.\\nNormally PCOS is detected by doing a blood test to check your hormone levels.\\nSome doctors do like to do an abdominal ultrasound to check for cysts on the ovaries but I don\\'t think you will need an internal one.\\nYou may want to have your mom or someone your close to come in the room with you. Most doctors won\\'t have a problem with that, especially in dealing with people your age.\\nI also wanted to tell you that you do not have to have all of the symptoms to have PCOS. In some woman PCOS only shows up in thier hormones and they don\\'t have any of the classic signs.\\nAlso, be sure to talk with your doctor about feeling uncomfortable with certain exams I\\'m sure she will understand since she is probably used to working with young people.\\nGood luck with your appointment.\\n\\nTHANKS!\\n\\nLori...I just wanted to respond to your comment about \\'diagnosing\\' PCOS through blood results..I was tested for this after telling my GYN I have about 2 periods a year,I do NOT have any other sympton of this condition,im skinny,not overweight,no excessive hair and no acne..she tested and my hormone results came back \\'suggestive\\' of PCOS.had a vaginal ultrasound and there were no cysts found...fast foward months later & a new GYN-she reviewed my history and said my last GYN was wrong & that I dont have PCOS & doesnt know why she would have diagnosed w/ me that,my hormones could have been out of whack at that particular time b/c I may have been ovulating or it could have been around that time of the month,so that would throw the results off track a bit..so my point is,you cant really go by blood work..there is no def\\' way to diagnose this so it makes it a whole lot harder..esp\\' for women like me who have been misdiagnosed\\n\\nYes I agree, there is not always a way to tell definitly that you do or do not have PCOS because many different woman have many different symptoms.\\nI have spoke to woman who have had the same problem as you. There are many woman who are diagnosed, undiagnosed and diagnosed again.\\nAlso, there are many woman with PCOS who at any given time may not have cysts on thier ovaries at all, so an ultrasound alone can not diagnose the syndrome.\\nThere are also alot of other conditions that can have many of the same symptoms of PCOS and that is why it is important to see an endocrinologist for a diagnosis.\\nI also wanted to add: I am not overweight, I do not have acne or excess hair but I\\nhave PCOS.\\n\\nYes I agree, there is not always a way to tell definitly that you do or do not have PCOS because many different woman have many different symptoms.\\nI have spoke to woman who have had the same problem as you.

When I called, they said that although they probably won\\'t have to do a pelvic exam, they do breast exams for everyone who presents with excessive hair.\\nI\\'m still going, but I\\'ll just refuse when I get there.

Then one in the a.m. and one in the p.m. for four days.  Then I would take one in the a.m. and two in the p.m. for seven days.  Then I would start taking 2 in the a.m. and 2 in the p.m. continuously.\\n\\nI do understand that they have to work up your dosage - but to me...this seems awfully high.\\n\\nEach tab is 500 mg. which means that if I'm eventually taking 4 pills a day, that's 2,000 mg per day!  Is that too much?\\n\\nI am 23 years old, very overweight with abnormal periods.  On my blood work, it said that my 'fasting blood sugar' was 22 Mg and it should have been 14 Mg and under.\\n\\nI've started the Metformin today, but I still can't help but wonder if this is too much.\\n\\nAny advice out there for those who are taking this type of med?\\nAny replies are greatly appreciated!\\n- Kari\\n\\nI have just been prescribed 2,000mg a day as well. At first I did not even fill my precription because I thought the dose was too high. I sceduled another apt. with my dr. for him to explain the dose to me!!\\n\\nMet needs to be at higher doses to cancel out the PCOS effects. I would assume that your dr. must have taken this and your blood work results into thought when prescribing your dose.\\n\\nMost women are on 1,500 - 2,000mg a day. I wouldn't worry...and I think it is a great idea that you are uping the meds slowly. Good luck.\\nHi\\nI have just started Metformin (1000mg per day), my gyn based his decision on my weight (I'm not overweight) and the severity of my PCO. I am also TTC but haven't been ovulating since coming off the pill. I think each person requires a different dosage depending on their situation, if you don't have any side effects then I would continue to take it as prescribed.\\nI have been on Metformin for three weeks and lost 12 pounds.  The doc told me to start out with 500mg a day for the first week, then the second week go up to 1000 mg a day; however, he did state if it made me too sick to go back to 500 mg and gradually build myself up to 1000 mg.  It has almost taken me four weeks but now I am on 1000 mg a day.  I had to personally start by taking my pills in the evening because it made me sick at my stomach, which in turn increase my sleeping by about 4 hour nap a day.  I am about 60 pounds overweight and I also have not had a period in 1.5 years since going off of birth control unless it was generated by progestrone pills from the doctor.\\n\\nGood Luck and hang in there!!!\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi everyone! My 16 year old daughter has recently been dx with PCOS. After 4 years of what seemed like normal periods they just stopped for 7 months..had a light one...now nothing for the last 2 months again. After many many blood tests and an ultrasound our GP dx Pcos and sent us off to Endo. More blood tests again. Her testosterone is high. The only symptom she is having is the non exsistant periods. She is not diabetic or insulin resistant. The Endo has recommended a low dose birth control pill for her. Could anyone give me their thoughts about their experiences with using bcp for PCOS? Thanks in advance.\\nI was not diagnosed with PCOS until in the last year (I am 29 now).  However I showed symptoms for years without any findings for why I was experienceing the symptoms and it eventually was determined by several doctors that it was a mixture of a poor diet and just the way it is for some women.  My initial symptoms had to do with my periods being irregular - at times really heavy and lasting for months - and at other times non existant.  The \"cure\" the doctor gave me when I was 18 was BC.  It certainly did regulate my periods while I was on it ( and remembered to take it everyday at the same time).  However it did nothing for my state of mind and moods.  During the years I was on it I suffered horrible mood swings and depression and bad temper.  Now, to be fair, I do have issues with depression, even off the BC, but the BC did affect it negatively despite trying several kinds.  Keep in mind also that the doctor that put me on the BC did it as a \\'quick fix\\' for what he saw as a simple an issue with my body regulating my periods so your daughter could certainly have an entirely different experience.  I would suggest that you monitor her mood levels with the introduction of the pills, and hopefully it will all go smoothly for you.  Since they were perscribed to treat a symptom of the PCOS rather than to \\'quick fix\\' an issue you may have a lot more success.  In the long run I found that BC was not something that agreed with me and I went on to suffer many other symptoms aside from just the irregular periods but these are now being monitored and treated properly.  I hope you and your daughter have found what works best for her but even if she does need to visit other avenues of treatment be comforted by the fact that she has had an early diagnosis and knows what she is dealing with so that you can both ensure she is properly cared for here forward whatever her needs may be.\\n\\nThank you Missymae for your reply!! I will certainly keep a look out for any mood problems. I appreciate your thoughtful reply.\\nHello. :) I\\'m sixteen as well, and I had irregular periods (yes, PCOS), I was put on Yasmin to regulate my periods. Though, I still have horrible moods, and I can get rather mean at that time of the month.  The pills didn\\'t affect my moods, nor did they remedy them. I don\\'t have cramps as bad anymore, but I still have them mildly. The pills DID help with the pain that comes with a period, but I would still recommend her to take midol, or something such as that, when (and if) cramps become present. The pill doesn\\'t stop the heavy bleeding on certain days (like I have heavy bleeding usually around day 2 or day 3), but it does stop the\\nperiod from being heavy. I personally would take having only one or two heavy days over the whole seven to ten day stretch being horribly heavy.\\n\\nI hope I helped some, and if not, just totally disregard this post. :)',\n",

       " {'post': \"hi everyone\\n\\nim not actually sure if i have PCOS although i do have some of the symptoms so am researching it at the moment. I read that losing weight is one of the main ways to control PCOS. i found this a bit confusing because isnt it the PCOS that actually causes weight gain?\\nAnyway,I was getting really overweight towards the end of last year and have recently managed to lose nearly a stone just through improving diet and taking more exercise. Since doing this my periods have become more regular and i now think i could be ovulating (i was trying for a baby last year and tests showed i wasnt ovulating, my periods were also on very long cycles). So im wondering if, if i do have PCOS, losing this weight has managed to control it? My bad skin has also improved recently although this could be a result of my diet being better, and ive also been letting the air get to my skin more lately.\\nHas anyone else noticed an improvement in their PCOS after losing weight? and does anyone know why this actually helps to control it?\\nany advice or insight would be greatly appreciated\\nmany thanks! xx\\nHi\\nI also have PCOS...what happens is the insulin makes a lot of our problems...it's an undlerlining problem, cholestrol (sp?) blood presure, testerone all go up when we gain weight. We can get a lot of our symptoms under control through diet, low carbing and no sugars...I only drink water. My insulin was 29 and now is 9...and that's through diet alone, I've lost 43 lbs and I'm finally ovulating every month...still haven't gotten pregnant yet, my acne has also improved...I realized that if I eat really bad and lots of carbs for 2 weeks my face will totally show it. I a firm believer in low carbs and no sugars...I'm praying one day that I'll get pregnant. If we lose 10% of our weight that improves our ovulation and chances of getting pregnant. I still have to lose about another 60 to 70 lbs. Are you taking any medications at the moment?\\nhi airees\\nthank you for your reply, im not taking any medications for PCOS as i havent been diagnosed yet, are there medications they can give you?\\nalso sorry if this is a bit personal or too much information, but when you werent ovulating were you still getting mucus, like you normally get when you ovulate? its just because i always noticed mucus half way through my cycle even when tests showed i wasnt ovulating. My doc said i was probably producing enough hormones to produce this but not enough to release an egg, which was quite confusing. How have you found out that you are now ovulating?\\nsorry for all the questions, just need all the advice i can get right now. thank you very much xx\\nNo problem...you can ask whatever you want\\nI've learned soooo much over the last year.\\n\\nIf I'm ovulating...I don't really get mucus, not sure if it's because of all the medications that I'm on to help me ovulate to help me get pregnant. I know that before I was even trying and tracking my cycles and was on any medications...I would get mucus too, but I'm not sure if I was ovulating or not at that time before I was going to all these doctors...some women with PCOS can't use ovulation monitors...my drs says I can...they ran some tests to make sure I was ovulating, sonogram to check for follicles, blood work and I used the monitor at the same time just to make sure I could use the monitors...so now I know I can use it...I go to a Reproductive doctor...she'll check my P4 levels 7 days after I think I have ovulated, the level has to be above a 10 to sustain a pregnancy...and if you're taking medications like Clomid, femara or follistim it has to be above a 15 for the medicated cycle.\\n\\nAlso, a lot of women take Metformin, Actos or Avandia to help with their insulin levels...I'm allergic to Metformin and can't take it, so all I have right now is to lose weight, low carbs, no sugars and drink only water...it's definitely helped me sooooo much, buts it's REALLY hard because of the PCOS...if there's any advice I can give you, it's to cut down on the carbs...and really try not to eat sugars...watch what you're drinking too. A lot of women that have PCOS are insulin resistant and later in time can become diabetic, have high cholestrol, high blood pressure, heart disease ect. If you need any other information, feel free to ask...I know a lot of girls with it and I'm learning something new everyday\\n\\nHi Fallen\\n\\nIf you suspect you may have PCOS I would suggest going to your doctor.  Testing initially involves some blood work and from there dependant on the results you may go on to have an ultrasound.  It is much easier than worrying about it.  Once you have your results and should you be diagnosed with PCOS you can be referred to a specialtist who will be able to best set you up on a treatment plan starting with what is the most problematic or important of your symptoms.  I spent years suffering from a slew of symptoms and had no idea there was something causing my problems until a fantastic doctor I went to for something totally unrelated flagged it up due to some of my visable symptoms (such as my weight).  Before this, despite years of complaining, I was always told things from its stress related, you have IBS, its simply your diet, some people are just like this, its all due to depression ( a side effect of PCOS - not the cause of it!) My specialist set me up on metformin first off to help both my weight and to start me ovulating again.  Although my results are apparently on the more positive side, within a matter of just over 3 months I dropped 20 lbs without altering my diet or excercise and I also started to menstruate again on a fairly regualer basis - which was certainly a difference from the on average 2-3 times a  year b4 that.  I am still in the early stages of treatment but I am definitely seeing progress  - I hope you can get this sorted for yourself ASAP\\n\\nYes me too I had to loose weight for my pcos then everything was getting better. Just try to excersise daily for an hour and eat better you will see improvement I promise\\n\\nIm not sure if loosing weight helps. I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 17 but I didnt have any syptoms till I was 20. I was really skinny then I started getting really fat. Ive been batteling with my weight since I was 20. Ive tried everything. Everything Ive tried worked very slowly and sometimes I wouldnt even loose any weight my weight would stay the same. My syptoms would clear up some but would come back.  So I tried a weight loss doctor he gave me a b-12 shot every week. It worked slowly but I lost weight my periods started to be regular and I became pregnant. My husband and I were trying for 4 yrs to have a baby. Dieting does not work for me after I had the baby I was dieting and exercising it didnt work. Ive only lost 27 pounds in the past 6 months since I had the baby. Now my weight is just staying the same and my syptoms are worse. I have more hair on my face, my periods are irregular, and I have bumbs all over my skin. I really dont know what to do.\",\n",

I am having tests done to check for PCOS.  My doctor believes that is the problem and not my thyroid.  Hence the username borderline\\nThey have always suspected a thyroid condition until now.\\nYour story will be greatly appreciated!\\nWell, for me I was on a lo dose birth control to regulate my periods for about 3 months which helped, and I got really busy, forgot to take my pills around the end of the month and I got pregnant.  I asked the doctor and they said that probably because it regulated me and then I missed some around the end of the month I was regular so I ovulated.  I also had stopped drinking soda.  I was eating healthy and getting up early for classes around 6-7 and going to bed around 9-10.  I have read that you get your best sleep before midnight.  So that is what worked for me.  As far as the diet goes I was eating more protein and veggies.  I was also exercising by running all over campus and having 2 jobs at the time.  All required moving around, lifting, etc.  So basically diet, exercise, and birth control.  As wierd as that sounds.  But I think that for most of us since we do not have periods we don't ovulate, so regulating our cycle helps us to ovulate.  I want another one as soon as I can take off the weight.  Although, I tell ya what, when I got pregnant, I had a lot of stress in my life, but good positive stress most of the time.  Now, it is bad stress.  You all know how men are..... Sometimes I think my husband is from planet DUH!!!  Good luck to everyone who wants to concieve.... I was the same way, all I ever wanted was to get married and have kids.... now I have my baby, but I'm not so happy with the marriage..lol.  Also, you probably know this but if you concieve have your progesterone level checked most of us have to be on progesterone for the first 10 weeks so we don't miscarry... It will make you feel like crap but it is worth it.  Also, search for doctors who will help you feel better, and not tell you the same old things... birth control, etc.  I had one tell me, oh PCOS does not impact weight in any way... what a dolt.\",\n",

I certainly will post with my doctor's explanation whenever I get in.\\nmy thyroid issue is also hashi's  and i have been looking at other postings about PCOS and  the insulin resistance link which then also links to thyroid problems!!!\\n\\nI am going to ask my gyn for some tests on this.\\nhi  karen,both of my sisters have  had pcos  for years.one has very thin hair at  the front  of her head and facial hair.the other has a moustache(ha,ha)she  waxes.that one also has long thick  hair in the middle of her chest.also waxes that.\\none had  sympoms  for years with no periods for years.she was finally diagnosed a couple years ago at age 35.my  grandma  had a beard now that i think about it,also male baldness patterns.some doctors believe  it to be genetic,some don't.i think it can  be.regular exercise will help this syndrome.after one sister lost weight,she had her 1st period for 7 years.\\n\\\\=\\nHi,It could be PCOS.\\nI am 39 yaers old and for a year straight had problems with ovarian cysts in both oivaries, since I was 13 had irregular painful periods, at the age of 17 I had my first cyst.\\n\\nAt the age of about 22 developed severe ovulation pain .  Docs were thinking I was probably popping cysts left and right.  9 years ago was put on the pill, to get me regulated and help ovulation also due to finding through a MRI an enlarged uteris.\\n\\nI was DX this past year with PCOS, also again wioth Enlarged boggey uteris and pelvic congestion.  I ended up with a hyst.

I had severe acne when I was a teen.\\nI also was dx with a wopping 254 cholesteral last year.  After my hyst it dropped to 222.  They said it was because of my overies.  I also have high Try's and low HDL's.  That is supposed to also be a sign of PCOS.\\nI guess you can get this problem at any age??  It is STILL confusing to me even now.  I still have alot of these problems\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi, I have never officially been diagnosed with PCOS, but I have been dealing with infertility for some time.  Over the past few years I have also suffered missed or no periods, painful periods, a little bit of unwanted hair growth, a huge amt of weight gain (about 50 lbs in 2 years) and I am always sleepy with no energy.  It has gone as far as me staying home now because it is so hard holding a job.  Anyways, I finally started seeing a RE and had bloodwork done and I am having a lap surgery and a exploratory procedure to see if my tubes are blocked (i am allergic to the dye that they use in an HSG).  So, today I spoke to the nurse and my bloodwork came back.  I had 8 viles drawn:  HIV, cystic fibrosis, insulin, progesterone, etc...  Well, she didn\\'t want to \"confirm\" anything with me because she said I would just talk to the dr on Friday.  But, she did tell me my insulin level was high and so were my hormone levels.  Sugar level was normal.  What does this mean?   What is the chances that I am diabetic?  Is this PCOS (or does it sound like it?)  I have read a lot on the net, but I like to hear you guys and your experiences.  Please, any information would be greatly appreciated.  What would be typically the next step?  I want a baby so bad!  What medicines are out there?  Can they be taken while ttc?  Thanks in advance.\\nHi Linsey, between your symptoms and your blood results, you definitely have PCOS. I have PCOS, and although I have an atypical case, yours sounds like classic PCOS. The good news is, many, many PCOS patients are able to conceive on Glucophage alone (esp. if your insulin is high), and even if not, Clomid and/or injectible drugs should allow you to conceive (assuming your tubes are open, if they\\'re closed, then you\\'ll need IVF). I am currently 11 weeks pg with twins after using a combination of Glucophage and Gonal-F to help me ovulate. Good luck!\\n\\nP.S. It sounds like you are insulin resistant, a hallmark of PCOS, but not diabetic yet, b/c your blood sugar level was normal. However, people with insulin resistance have a much greater chance of developing diabetes later on, so Glucophage and modified diet can help.\\nI have PCOS and hyperinsulinemia. Usually the two go hand in hand. I have too much insulin and I take Glucophage XR for that. I just had lap surgery for a uterine abnormality. I had a septate shaped uterus that had to be opened up to make more room, I had a big cyst on one of my ovaries that had to be removed, and I had Stage I endo behind my uterus that had to be lasered off. I will start taking the Clomid next month. I will keep you posted on my progress and I hope this helps some. Good luck to you.\\nHey Shortstuff, I have already been on Clomid.  And it is helping me ovulate because my progesterone levels were good on day 13.  Does the glucophage (sp?) only help you ovulate?  Because it looks as though I already ovulate, so who knows what is really going on.  I forgot to mention that I have a darkening of skin around my neck and also between my breasts.  I know that is pretty typical of PCOS.  I bought a book today on it, so hopefully that will offer some more info for me.  I hope I am on the right road to getting pregnant!\\nI too have pcos and finally got my hands on metforin (glucophage) and it did work.  I did become pregnant after only about 3 months.  I had the histoenchephologram that said my tubes were blocked too, but apparently not anymore.  We did lose that baby at 15 weeks for reasons we do not know yet.  They are still testing, it was only 2 days ago.  There is hope!!!  Keep trying.  The metforin controls your insulin levels enabling ovulation to occur.  God bless.\\nHey, I too was diagnosed with PCOS, just a few months ago. It does definitley sound like you have PCOS. I am learning how to deal with it myself. I am still waiting for my menstrual to start after 4 month on Metformin.\\nI agree with the others that you have PCOS.  I have been taking Metformin for about seven months and have had 3 periods on my own after almost 3 years of no AF.  Because I am still irregular, my doctor just put me on Femara, which is similar to Chlomid, on days 3-7.  I have researched Femara, and everything says that it has the same success rate as Chlomid but does not stay in your system, and thus does not have the same adverse side effects.  You might want to look into it.  I did not actually ovulate after my first month on it, so my DR. doubled the dose for this month.  Hopefully that will work!!!  I will try that for two more months and then go to an RE.\\nBest of luck to you and tons of baby dust!\\nhi linsey,\\ni have pcos too. i was just diagnosed about 2 months ago. right now i\\'m on 1000mg of glucophage (generic metformin) and am waiting for af so i can start clomid. apparently the glucophage/clomid combo is very effective and up to 90% of pcos women ovulate on it.\\nglucophage is actually a drug that is for  diabetes but it is also used to treat pcos. a large number of women with pcos  are also insulin-resistant. that means that our bodies produce too much isulin. while this is not the same as diabetes, it can lead to type 2 daibete if not treated.\\nwomen who are isulin-resistant often don\\'t respond to clomid alone, but do pretty well on the combo.\\n\\nglucophage will lower your insulin and help balance out your hormones so you will ovulate. other benefits are that you will hopefuly have more energy (not in the beginning. a lot of women get even more tired the first couple of weeks. i was like that but feel much better now and have more energy), and lose weight. weight loss doesn\\'t always happen but lots of women say that they feel they lose weight more easily if they excercise while they are on glucophage.\\n\\nhope that answers some of your questions. feel free to ask away!\\nbest of luck.\\nI became pregnant while using metforin and losing a bit of weight.My husband and I tried for 2 years. My fertility doc gave me progesterone suppositories and ordered me on bed rest for the first trimester when I started to bleed. I guess sometimes for women with PCOD there can be low progesterone levels in the body until the placenta kicks in and starts producing it in proper levels. After the first trimester the pregnancy was healthy and normal. I am the proud mother of a beautiful healthy 2 month old girl at the age of 32. Good luck and never give up hope. We actually got pregnant when we decided to take a break from trying to get pregnant.\\nHi\\nI also was dx with PCOS over 1 year ago. I am 39 years old.\\nSince I was 13 had painful irregular periods, I would even get nauseas and vomit at times.  When I was 16 I just stopped getting my period all together for 1 year.  When I was 17 have a cyst on my ovary.  Had 2 children at a young age.  I was 20 when I had my son and 21 when I had my daughter.  Had bad pregnancies, almost miss carried both, I bled during my pregnancies and had pregnancy diabetes with my daughter.  I also dont carry full term.\\nAfter having my daughter I had severe painful ovulation.  So, now I was dealing with painful irregular periods and painful ovulation.  I was put on the pill but I totaly swelled up from it so I stopped.\\n( years ago was put back on the pill due to an Enlarged Uteris.  Was on the pill for eight years and developed massive ovarian cysts, also clusters of cysts on my ovaries.\\nHad blood work done and my hormone levels were ok, but they said I was developing Insulin Resistance and my Tryglicerides were high and HDL were low, at this point my GP felt I was PCOS.\\nI started Metorfimin. My BC pill was changed 5 times in 10 months and NOTHING was working !!  I WAS SO SICK AND IN SO MUCH PAIN CONSTANTLY !! I was just getting worse and worse with the Ovarian cysts and my stomache was massive !!  Had a Lap and D&C in April then in May had a hyst, everything removed but my cervix. They said after my surgery that my ovaries were enlarged and cystic, I had severe pelvic congestion and I had Adenomyosis. I have never felt better in my whole life like I do now !!!!!!!  Except for menapause, but if that is the worse of it I will have to deal with it.\\nI am still on Metformin because my sugar levels still are a bit boarderline.  It actualy went up 3 points.\\nI am wondering can you still have the PCOS symptoms even though your ovaries are out?\\nI know before my hyst my total cholesteral was 254, after surgery it dropped to 222.  They said that happened due to my ovaries.  My Trys and HDL are still high, my blood sugar fast is 105, I have hair growth above my lip, under my chin, and on my toes and my nipple area and my belly button area.  I have oily skin too.',\n",

Some of the classic signs are no period, excess hair, acne in the pubic region as well as on the jaw line and neck, and overweight. I have most of those symptoms. Also, blood sugar levels and insulin are to different tests. You can have PCOS or PCOS insulin resistance. That is when your body creates too much insulin which in turn causes problems with your hormones and anything you eat, your body will grab all the carbs and store them even if you dont need them. That is what causes the weight gain. I have that one....yeah me. Oh and PCOS is hereditary so all us PCOS ladies can thank our parents. Males and females can be carriers. I hope this helps, but get tested and good luck.\\n\\nSherry\\nTTC #1 4yrs\\nThanks Sherry.

My older sister is very regular, but has high sugar and is overweight.  At the moment, I have nonexistant periods because I do not ovulate.\\nI did pick up a book called Sugar Busters.

I\\'ve recently gone through some things that I thought ment I was pregnant - when I went for all the pregnancy tests they came back negative. So, the only thing left that it could be I guess is PCO - least that\\'s what the doctors figure. I am overweight, and have an irggergular period.\\nWhen i went for my testing she gave me two pills called \"Withdrawal\" - she says it was to bring my period on. I didn\\'t take them because she said I\\'de feel really sick and within 5 days AF would be here. My only fear is that I have been feeling not so hot - upset tummy n stuff, for some time now so I\\'m waiting until my ultra sound. Anyone ever heard of that pill? I heard they give it to women, kinda like the \\'morning after\\' pill. None the less, glad I can come here with my concerns n stuff. Thanx for the support ladies.\\n\\nBlessings,\\nDindrane\\nNo, I got prescribed just plain old prestergone to bring on AF.  I have yet to take it though because I am waiting to hear back on a pregnancy test.  That would be a miracle if it came back positive.\\nI did an internet search on Withdrawl and couldn\\'t find anything.  Maybe that was just her terminology for that pill.\\nWhat\\'s the ultrasound for?  To see if you have polycystic ovaries?\\nYa, I went today and he did a lot of clicking - I couldn\\'t see the screen that well but when I looked I could have swarn that I seen some spots there - white type circles, three on one spot and a few in others <but like I said I couldn\\'t see it that well because I couldn\\'t tilt my head like that for to long lol>. I could have been seeing things - like it could be my mind taking me on a bad trip, but I dunno what its supossed to look like. I tried looking up pics online but can only find ultra sounds of babies thus far. I\\'ll keep searching.\\nIt hurt too when he was doing the ultra sound - like a dull pain where he moved the whatever its called  *grin*. Not like he was using all his strength to push down but it was very tender... so I dunno, won\\'t find out til next friday.\\nWish me luck!\\n\\nBlessings,\\nDindrane\\nThis is in response to do I really have PCOS. I have the same questions. I have no symptoms whatsoever of PCOS, just that my doctor did blood work because I had some weight gain - he thought it was my thyroid - I am 41- and it turned out that my male hormones to female hormones was 3 to 1, and it should be 1 to 1. He said my symptoms were \"masked\" because I am already on birth control pills and have been for about 15 years. (I might add I have 2 kids and never had a problem with irregular periods or conception.) He said that the bcp\\'s were why I did not have the acne, facial hair, etc., that they kept these symtoms \"away\" or I would have been worse.  He has put me on metformin - 500 mg. twice a day. I have been on it for just over a month and have had not ONE side effect, thank goodness. NOT ONE. (Is this normal or is it not working yet?) What is this supposed to do and what does testosterone have to do with insulin. He described it , but now I am confused!  Will I get the weight off somehow with met and cutting back on carbs, perhaps? It was about 15 lbs in 3 months. Any insight appreciated.',\n",

I don\\'t have an official diagnosis of PCOS, but I was wondering exactly what the term \"weight around the middle\" refers to. Is it just talking about your waist, or does it include your hips, back, thighs etc.?\\n\\nI know not everyone has all the symptoms of PCOS, but I was just curious if I could blame some of my extra pounds on the syndrome.\\n\\nIf you tend to be shaped like an apple or hold your extra pounds around your middle instead of your legs & butt is what it refers to \"thick around the middle\".\\n\\nKeep in mind if you have PCOS you could have some insulin resistance from the extra body fat. Fat interferes w/ the job insulin is supposed to do. Insulin is supposed to  move glucose from the blood and store extra as fat. If you have high blood sugar numbers above about 100 fasting and over 120 2 hrs after eating, then you probably have some insulin resistance. Also, the carbs you are eating are helping you keep and gain more extra fat.\\nMy friend was diagnosed w/ PCOS and I asked her to try what I call a cave man food plan for 1 month. She lost 9 lbs and that in turn lowered her insulin resistance. Her blood sugar went down. Its all reciprocal.\\nThe food plan is this, if you cant hunt it, fish it, grow it or raise it, dont eat it. For 1 month. That means nothing that comes in a box, no bread, no pasta. Fruits and veggies are a must, and eating something every 2 hrs gets your metabolism reved. So use bread as a wrapping and throw it away but eat whats in between. Milk and cheese are great. Cheese cubes as snacks, egg salad, chicken salad, tuna salad, shrimp salad, (dont worry about the fat from the mayo it will help you feel full)Drink water. You should loose about 2lbs a week.\\nYou will be amazed at what loosing some pounds will do. If you have higher blood sugars it will lower them. If you have irregular periods it can straighten them out. If you are trying to get pregnant, loosing some pounds will help. As far as blaming the pounds on the syndrome, you actually could blame the syndrome on the extra pounds. But having the syndrome and the extra pounds just makes your body want to hold on to and gain more. Like I said its all reciprocal.\\n\\nIts a',\n",

Sorry, I don't know if these are one in the same.\\nthe only way i know how to explain it is that your insulin regulates your glucose(sugar). so yes there is a difference. i hope that helps somewhat.\\nWhen you have a glucose test, you have to fast and then drink some stuff and wait an hour and then they take blood. There's also a 3 hour glucose test. I think with the insulin test you have to fast and give blood.\\nA glucose test measures the amount of sugar/glucose in your blood. Insulin is thing that transports the sugar from your blood to your cells so they are nourished. An insulin test will determine whether or not your pancreas is making insulin. Hope that helps.\\nBy the way...\\nHaving extra insulin is a sign of insulin resistance which may lead to type 2 diabetes, high glucose levels show insulin resistance, type 2 or pcos.

Thanks in advance.\\nHi.  My only symptom of PCOS was irregular periods, my dr. did some bloodwork and diagnosed me.  Just a note--I have read that opk's are not always accurate in women with PCOS.  I'm not really sure why, I know it has to do with the imbalance of hormones but it's something that I've read a few times.  Some women with PCOS have had babies without any help of medications, some need more help.  Some have changed their diets and lifestyles and that has done the trick.  PCOS is strange in the way it affects women, some more severely than others.  I am currently on metformin and clomid to help me conceive.  I would suggest talking to your dr. about your irregular cycles.  It sounds like you are ovulating later than you normally do.  My cycles last for about 40 days, so I used to think my period was late then I started charting my temps and realized that I don't ovulate until about day 23 so my periods weren't late at all, I just had long cycles.  However, irregular cycles does not always mean PCOS so talk to your dr. about your concerns---keep us posted on what you find out.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Im 15 years old and i just got diagnosed with PCOS.. like what the hell?  im so young and the threads i read are all by 20-something year olds... its just weird. im so upset. i knew something was wrong with me. after multiple blood tests and ultrasounds.. NO RESULTS of anything wrong with me until i went to my family doctor. yeah my acne is real bad. he says hes going to treat that first and then the PCOS. the doctor didnt make the PCOS a big deal at all.. i mean, I THINK IT IS. its a damn syndrome... but yeah i do have excess facial hair.. especiailly on my abdomen. and a little on my face. i get so upset over it. im sure theres medicine to help that though right? =) so yeah. im just upset. and lost.. i need a PCOS buddy or something LOL.  and my breasts are hurting alot alot alotttttt.. is it connected to the PCOS? but yes, thank you to anyone who read this. repllies would be GREatly appreciated.\\nI would just take a deep breath. Keep in mind you need to do as much research as possible and you will feel better. If you need to loose weight, start exercising and lower your refined carbs (anything that comes from a box/bag usually made w/flour & sugar)Stick to fruits & veggies. Drink lots of water and follow your docs advice. Keep in mind modern medicine is getting so much better that they couldnt diagnosis stuff like this recently. If you asked the people diagnosed at 20s they probably have had symptoms for a while...You got lucky & got diagnosed early.\\nWOW! I wish I had been diagnosed when I was 15 instead of 22. I know you are feeling alot of crap about this but you have an early diagnosis, so you can get this under control before it gets way out of hand. In my teen years I always knew something was wrong too, I have always been about 10-15 pounds overweight. I had acne for 10 years, I took accutane last year to finally get rid of it after a 10 year battle with many other acne treatments.\\n\\nI used to have extremely painful ovulation when I was a teenager, but no one really believed me, but they put me on the birth control pill. I was doing fine on the pill for a while then I went for 10 months without a period. So the doc said i was perfectly normal and gave me provera to start my period. That was the worst period ever! Then I was off and on birth contol pills for several years, Irregular periods, still overweight, still fighting acne. At 20 years old I started taking Depo provera shot for the convenience. I gained 10 more pounds. I took it for 9 months and then I stopped using birth contol alltogether. And i didn\\'t have my period again until this year, I am 23.\\n\\nI went to a new obgyn and she listened to my symptoms, and said it was most likely PCOS, gave me some pamplets and info, and a blood test confirmed it was pcos, and now i am using the nuva ring for birth control, very satisfied with everything. I am trying to lose weight with a lower healthier carb diet, but it is so hard to undo bad habits.\\n\\nOh when I took the acctane last year, you have to sign paperwork agreeing to use two forms of birth contol, so my dermatologist gave me ortho tricyclen, It made me so imbalanced and crazy I took it for two months and hated it. The differnet levels of hormone every week made me practically bipolar!\\n\\nI am at my healthiest and happiest now. but there are other treatments for PCOS. Please do your research online and make sure you have an openminded doctor. I am planning to try other treatments such as metfornin soon, and if I need to, clomid.\\n\\noh yes, and I am a hairy girl too! i have to recommend waxing. get yourself an at home microwave wax kit to do your lip and abdomen. I still shave my arms and legs though.\\n\\nit is really not so bad now that I know what it is that I have and I can plan action to treat it. I think you will do fine as well.\\nIt\\'s a tough thing to handle at a young age...I was diagnosed when I was 13 myself, so I know what you are going through.\\n\\nDefinatly follow whatever advice your doctor has, as it will help lessen any complications you may have in the future.  Birth control can help a lot...there are other drugs that can help lessenthe hair, but waxing or shaving are usually the quickest options.\\n\\nBest advice I can give you is to keep up with your checkups and have an exam annually.  This is the best way to keep on top of it and catch any other problems you may develop from the PCOS.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a little support, there is another great forum out there It\\'s completely dedicated to PCOS and they discuss everything there.  Lots of help, answers and support there.\\n\\nif you are interested let me know and I\\'ll give you the link. . You will find other young girls going through it there as well\\nI know I\\'m quite late in replying to this thread, but if I\\'m allowed, I would love to give my input.  I\\'ve been reading this board for a very long time, but never posted; this is my first!  Alright.  I was diagnosed with PCOS about 2 years ago.  I\\'m 20 now.  All throughout high school I noticed I had a \"happy trail\" beginning at my belly button continuing until it blended with the pubic hair.  I really didn\\'t think anything was wrong with me; I just thought I was genetically hairier than every other girl.  Well, the hair worsened and about the time I turned 19, my face exploded with acne.  I never had a regular period, and after a visit with my Ob/Gyn, I came away with only a diagnoses of PCOS...not really understanding anything about this symptom (and yes, it is only a symptom; however the \"S\" stands for syndrome and there is a difference between that and a disease, but I\\'ll explain in just a minute).  After trying 3 kinds of birth control and many acne medicines, I\\'m 2 months into Yasmin and 3 months into Spironolactone.  The acne is somewhat under control as I only have it on my cheeks and sides of my chin (but I am fed up with even the small amount I have, so I\\'m beginning Accutane December 16).  Anyone with PCOS, I advise you to visit an endocrinologist.  This problem is hormonally related, and not so much an ovarian disorder.  Keep in mind, also, that this misnamed \"syndrome\" does not mean a girl has cysts on her ovaries.  The follicles aren\\'t cysts at all.  See, each month a woman releases an egg.  The normal, uninterrupted cycle will flush that egg every 28 days, approximately.  With PCOS, the woman experiences irregular periods, ergo failing to flush the egg.  This causes a \"back-up,\" if you will, resulting in POLY-\"many\" follicles.  The best and safest treatment is birth control, because after a lengthy period of time with no period, the cells which should have been shed monthly begin to mutate, and that\\'s where many women run into ovarian cancer.  Keeping your periods regular keeps the poly \"follicles\" from forming.  One would think this would cure PCOS, but this is where the uneducated namers of this syndrome come into play.  PCOS was named in the 1950s after women would report signs of hirsutism (excess, abnormal hair growth) along with acne and irregular periods (also, most - a reported 80% -  are/were overweight).  Our misguided forefathers named this collection of symptoms PCOS.  The birth control helps regulate periods, but, you may ask, what about the hair and acne and weight?  Spironolactone takes 6 months before it completely works on decreasing hair and making it nonexistent.  I must say that my hair growth has slowed tremendously on this drug.  (I\\'m taking 200mg/day, which is the max dose, but it isn\\'t advised when taking Yasmin as well because of the DRSP in Yasmin.  Both act in such ways as to increase K+ -Potassium- levels, which is highly dangerous, so I\\'m about to decrease my dose of Spiro to 50mg/day.)  As for acne, this is when you want to work hand-in-hand with a dermatologist who will listen to you and try to work with you.  I\\'ve been to many who blew me off, so find a good one.  They are out there.  Many treatments exist, the difficult and time consuming task is trying to find the right one(s) for you.  As for the weight challenge with PCOS, I\\'m a little cloudy on this because I\\'m 5\\'8\" and 123lbs.  My bloodwork suggests nothing of PCOS (not elevated ANYTHING), not even insulin resistance (high insuling levels); mine were actually low, but because of the \"collection of symptoms,\" that\\'s the diagnoses given to me.  Anyway, I\\'ve read about Metformin and Glucophage being effective in aiding weight-loss.  So do check up on that along with a healthy diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, meat, grains (notice I said GRAINS...whole WHEAT does not equal whole GRAIN), and the healthy fats...if that isn\\'t an oxymoron.  Stay away from frozen foods, white flour, high fructose corn syrup, gluten, and saturated and trans fats (among other things, but I just listed what came to mind).  That reminds me...the only reason HEART ATTACK, STROKE, and other life-threatening diseases are mentioned along with PCOS patients is that the majority are overweight.  This is what causes those occurences.  Just because you have PCOS, doesn\\'t mean you are going to suffer from any of those.  An overweight person without PCOS would be just as likely to experience these simply because they are overweight.  This is not to say all of us \"underweighters\" are in the clear.  We have to lead a healthy lifestyle as well.  Remember...exercise is key no matter what age or weight you are!\\n\\nWhew, I\\'ve written so much that I forgot my train of thought.  I guess this is all I have to say for now.  I\\'ll post more if it comes to mind.  Oh!!  One very important point I can\\'t stress enough...DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!!!!  PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!  Look up all you can about whatever may be ailing you.  Get many many viewpoints.  This will help not only to educate you, but will also give you a better understanding of what your doctor is telling you so that you may ask the right questions and be on the same train of thought as him/her.  PLEASE do your own research!!!  Most of my knowledge comes from reading others\\' experiences and researching tests, etc. I find myself usually one step ahead of the doctors when I go for a visit.  This also helps me better determine if they are a \"quack\"...I use the term with all due respect because these doctors have gone to school and put themselves through a lot to be where they are.  I guess a better way to say it is \"...if they are best-suited to deal with my problems...\"\\n\\nHope I helped a little. I know I went on and on, but if you get one thing out of this, let it be to DO YOUR OWN IN-DEPTH RESEARCH.  Have a wonderful holiday, and I look forward to reading all the replies!\\nOH MY thanks so much for that..lol it really did help alot.  man i have no time to reply to everyones im so sorry..but yeah. im so lost not even funny.. im so confused about everything but im too confused & dumb to undersatnd some of the stuff i research on.. thing is,my doctor doesnt seem to give aflying **** about my pcos lol.... but yeah.. any information would help honestly. long long entries are very welcomed =)',\n",

I was diagnosed after going to the dr b/c I was trying to conceive and it wasn't happening.  My dr. did bloodwork and diagnosed me based on my hormone levels.  I'm not overweight, I don't have a hair or acne problem.  My only symptom was very irregular cycles.  I, too, am on metformin.  There are many success stories about women changing thier diet and their symptoms have gone away.  After trying to conceive for over a year, I just found out that I am pregnant.  I had to take metformin and clomid to make me ovulate.  Just be sure you have a dr. you can trust and feel comfortable asking questions to.  PCOS is very common but it goes undiagnosed in most women.  Do some research on it and there are lots of good books out in which you can educate yourself on it.  I hope this helps.  Good luck.\",\n",

I was on the potty every hour at first and it made me feel like I was going to get sick all the time. I decided to stick it out. The side effects are still there but not enough to make me stop taking it. I took pepto for about a week and that helped alot.

I am having, though, the same thing as you in one aspect: I cannot stop eating, I am craving food, all day long. I thought that metformin was supposed to HELP with controling appetite - especially in my case, as I have very high levels of testosterone and that was what was making my appetite huge before I was diagnosed and the Dr. said this would help immensely. Well, at 1000 mg a day, it did, but at 1700, it has gone back. Totally confused on this one...but, unlike you I have had not one, and I mean NOT ONE side affect AT ALL (sorry to tell you that).\\nI'm glad you haven't felt bad, Jenna.\\nBut I have stopped being hungry all the time.

And I wasn't hungry.\\n\\nHave you cut down on sugars and carbs? it has helped me immensely, even though it's a major pain! Drink diet drinks instead of regular soda, use Splenda instead of sugar, and cut out white bread, potatoes, white rice etc. Eat more whole grains and more protein/fruits and vegetables.\\n\\nIt helped me, and I never thought I'd not be hungry all the time.

       " {'post': \"About 3 years ago I started having long stretches between my periods. It was kind of random like once ever 3 or 4 months i would have it. Then i moved in with my sister and i seemed to be quite regular for that year. then as soon as we didn't live together i started having major stretches in between my periods, like 4 months , 5 monthes etc. i have brought this up to my doctor and have had paps, bloodwork and nothing shows up. i'm 26 years old and never had any problems before that. has anyone else experienced this type of irregularity, and what are some possible reasons for it?\\n\\nin one of my blood test results a couple years ago my doctor said i had high levels of testorone. i am just wondering if that is why this could be happening.\\nThere are two issues here. It is quite common for females living together to have more regular periods and sometimes even to synchronise menstural cycles. So that could account for being more regular when living with your sister.\\nAs for the frequency of your periods. When I was younger before having children I would go up to three or four months between periods. I always thought that was just me and never went to a doctor. I now have a teenage daughter with PCOS, and PCOS is hereditory.\\nMy daughter was lucky to be diagnosed at 14, PCOS is difficult to diagnose, is very underdiagnosed and many women go for years with unexplained symptoms. My daughters periods had completly stopped for 7 months, I didnt worry at first as I thought it was normal like me as a teenager. Apparantly the time to worry is if you have less than 6 periods a year, as that puts you at hight risk of endometrial cancer. It might be worth visiting your doctor again. My daughter was diagnosed from a blood test, followed by ultrasound scan of her overies. You could express your concerns and discuss if these investigations are appropriate for you.\\nwow! That is quite the concern.  I have my periods much less than 6 times a year. Only like 3 sometimes 4 times per year.  It has been like this for the past couple years, and like i said prior to that It was regular.\\n\\nIt's really frustrating. I recently had bloodwork done and everything looked ok in the results.  Are there any other possible reasons this could be happening?\\nWell despite your recent investigations showing nothing I think you should return to the doctor and discuss this with them.\\nI have bloodtests coming up soon, if there is something out of order it will show up them i presume.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I was diagnosed with PCOS in 2000 and went on metformin, spiro and ortho tri cyclen.  within a few months my skin was clear and my facial hair was significantly reduced.  I thought I could come off my meds but my  doctor told me that if I lost weight, I could come off my meds.  Since then I have lost over 80lbs and last december was taken off of spiro.  This past july I moved to London from NY and decided to come off my meds altogether.  Within 2 months ALL of my symptoms came back with a vengence!!  My doctor here told me that PCOS is not curable and can only be maintained - usually with minimal meds like what I was on in June (1000mg of Metformin and BCP).\\n\\nNow I am back on metformin, aldactone but in the UK they don\\'t have Ortho Tri Cyclen so I have tried 2 different types of BCP (Cilest and Yasmin) which have not helped.  I went to see a derm and she said that since PCOS is hormonal, acne is therefore not curable and once you get off the meds that help with the acne, it will come back (as it did for me).  She said the only way to permanantly get rid of acne is via Accutane.\\n\\nDoes anyone have any experience with Accutane?  I have heard some bad things about it and am a bit nervous going down that route.  I am okay with having to take metformin for the rest of my life but at some point I am going to want to try to have children and will need to come off of BCP and spiro (I am 33).  I don\\'t want to spend that time with a face full of acne as it  causes me to get so depressed.\\n\\nAny help would be appreciated..\\n\\nhey,  im very similar to you! im in my early 20\\'s, found out i had PCOS in my college health office last year.  ugh lol. i had all the symptoms for years but was never taught about it in health class, so i never knew....acne, irregular periods, painful periods...etc. Finally i was put on orthotricyclen ( after a horrendous trial of the LO version) and accutane....i recommend it 100%. i was so depressed before with the acne and everything, but now im in my 3rd month and am so happy with the results, and its not even done for another 3 months\\nMy side effects have only been slight back pain and a few breakouts in my first 2 months. Now i see a large difference, less oil, and am much happier! i really recommend it as i know that having tried all other meds for acne before this is whats helped me the most and the quickest, with the good chance ( i hope !) that it will take it away forever. I really recommend trying it, it\\'s been great for so many people, including myself. good luck\\n\\nhey.... I quickly googled Accutane side effects, heres one of the links..\\n\\n[url]http://www.health-longevity-magazine.com/accutane-side-effects.html[/url]\\n\\nI was thinking about that too.... but I here its very harmful for your body.... so im kinda of scared of it making problems worse\\n\\nThanks Lexla.  I am glad you have had good results with accutane.  I am afraid of the long term side effects but having acne makes me so depressed that I am kinda leaning towards going through with it..\\n\\nLet me know how the rest of your treatment goes..\\nThanks for this link.  I have done a bit of research myself and it looks pretty scary!  My derm here says that most of these symptoms only occur when treating with high dosage.  She said that for PCOS she would just have me on the minimal dosage/duration.  I wouldn\\'t be as nervous if I could be sure that if the symptoms were bad enough I could just stop the accutane and it would go away.  But am not sure what the long term effects are.....\\n\\nLet me know if you decide to go through with it.  At the moment I am leaning towards yes but am not sure.  My derm gave me a topical version of accutane (combined with an antibiotic) and if this works I may just decide to stick to the topical version even if it is for the rest of my life\\n\\n\\n\\nWell I was diagnosed with PCOS for about a year now definately. I was on all the meds as well, and I stopped taking them in July. I could not handle it and  I too dont plan to be on pills the rest of my life. When i was on the pills it didnt seem to help anyway. I only had my period once this year and none of the pills helped me to regulate it either. So I have no idea what to do with myself, and I am at the point where I want to have children as well.\\nIn my opinion, the metformin is really only used to control your sugar levels and so they claim to help you ovulate. For me it did not do anything but control my sugar levels which can also be controlled by eating correctly. I just feel like if I find the right doctor who will put me on like Provera pills, so that my menstrual will come, I will feel alot better.\\nHi,  I also live in the U.K.  I was diagnosed with pcos in jan this year.  I have like you been put on metformin.  For my Facial hair I was given a new cream in Sept this year, which not many people have heard of in the u.k.  It is called Vaniqa Eflomithine.  You are expected to see results within 2 months. I  can say that i have seen results not only in my facial hair, but of the clearing up of my acne.  The only downfall is you have to continuosly use it. And it is to be applied twice a day.  If you miss a dose that is o.k as long as it is not longer than a six week period  as the hair and acne do come back.\\nUnfortunately im still trying to find a succesful way to lose my weight.  I cannot seem to shift any weight at all and that is the bit that depresses me.  I have had 2 children and both times came home from hospital after there births in a size 10 trousers.  my youngest is now 4 yrs old and that is the bit that upsets me being able to lose the weight after child birth but now rocketing to a size 16.  Also i was told i wouldn\\'t be able to have anymore children, but i have for friends who all have pcos and all 4 went on to succesfully have children, so i dont think this side of pcos is that much to worry about.  But i would be grateful if some one has any tips on weight loss.\\n\\nI\\'m going to try NutriSystem in about a week.  They\\'ve already sent me my month\\'s worth of food, so I just have to psych myself up enough to try it.  They\\'ve put me on a 1,200 calorie diet, so I\\'m a bit nervous, considering I consume about 3,000 calories per day.  I\\'m thinking about starting it over this holiday weekend so I can adjust a little bit before I go back to work.  I just KNOW I\\'m going to be downright cranky because the portions are SO small!  They\\'re really very small portions...\\n\\nI am also a size 16.  I weigh 230 lbs. and I\\'m 5\\'4\" tall.  I haven\\'t been a size 10 since high school.\\n\\n\\nOh that is the other thing..... I have been on Yasmin before. At first it started out okay. Then after awhile I started gaining weight from it, and I began to have a lot of breast tenderness, and a low sex drive. It was weird because in the beginning it was wonderful and then after about a month or two forget it. I stopped taking birth control pills because I became scared of the fact that some people I know who took it for awhile, and is trying to get pregnant now, are having a very hard time. Also when the doctors put me on Metformin in January, my menstrual totally stopped even while I was on Birth control. I didnt have a problem with the birth control pills making my menstrual come until I started the metformin, but the doctors didnt believe that either. Also I was always told that as long as your period comes 4x a year that you are okay. One time a year is not enough cleaning out for your body. I mean I get bloated and everything, so imagine being bloated for 11 months out of 12. I don\\'t know what is going on, except the fact that I want a doctor to give me some provera pills.  I had all kind of test done and they didnt come up with any reason why my period is not coming. I have no cyst at all. So the doctors keep trying to make up excuses. Like for starters after all the test was done, and nothing was found, my GYN tried to say that it was because I am overweight. She never even realized that I lost 30lbs since she even diagnosed me with PCOS. It was really apparent that she did not know why I was not getting my menstrual and why the metformin was not working. the only thing she kept saying was well the metformin helps people to ovulate. I tried to explain well it does not seem to be working for me. After a few months of going to her and every month I kept telling her I didnt get my period yet, and every month she asking me if I am pregnant and making me take a HPT test, I got fustrated and stopped going to her all together. So now I am looking for a different GYN. I actually found one but my appt is not until February. I will have see what she says.\\n\\n\\nI would encourage you to try it and not take out your ovaries or have them removed!lol I mean everyone has a different body. your body might adapt quite well to it. My body is known to react differently than most people anyway. Try it though!\\n\\nI know, I know.  I\\'m actually set to try it, I\\'m just STILL waiting for my period!  My last Provera pill was on Tuesday, and I still haven\\'t seen anything, not even spotting.\\n\\nI still say it might be worth considering, though.  I might be the first voluntary hysterectomy of a non-transsexual!\\n\\n:::wink:::',\n",

I've never missed a period, heck I used to have the most regular body... until recently my period has been up to 5 days late/early (recently being about a year) - I still never missed one though .  I'm constantly tired, have acne (where the meds hardly help that the dermotolgist gives me), have 'extra' hair (facial/neck/fingers/toes areas), weight gain, cold sensitive... but these are all symptoms of thyroid problems too.  I had my thyroid check and a couple of the results were close to being borderline.\\n\\nI'm just wondering if I should go ahead and have the tests done for PCOS - besides PCOS (and thyroid) is there anything else that causes these symtoms?  (I can live with everything but the fatigue... it's starting to affect my work)\\nmy only symptom was that i stopped having my period after i went off the pill last year. i had been on the pill for about 2-3 years and before that i always have very regular periods.ultrasound revealed that i also had the characteristic cysts on my ovaries. anyway, i'd say there is no harm in getting tested for pcos. it's a simple blood test anyway that they should be able to do the same time they test your thyroid. good luck.\",\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi\\nI am thinking that my daughter maybe PCOS.  If it is hereditary then I would say most deffinately since I was dx with it over a year ago.  But the thing is some of her symptoms are different than mine was.\\nShe is 18 years old and started her period when she was 15. (i started mine when I was 13)\\n\\nShe did skip 1 full year of her menstral cycle.  When she was 16 she stopped getting her period till she was 17.  (I did the exact same thing and at the same exact age)\\n\\nHer periods are regular.  She gets them every month.  (I NEVER got my period every month.  I could go as far as 60 days with out a period)\\n\\nShe does have acne.  (I did as well and still get acne at the age of 40)\\n\\nShe has facial hair.  (Me too)\\n\\nShe is getting pain in her lower left abdominal side in the middle of the month.  I am guessing at least from my personal experiance it is ovulation pain.  She said it hurts.  I am guessing she maybe cystic.  aT LEAST THIS IS FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIANCE..  (I went through years of severe ovulation pain so bad I could not walk and my stomache would swell.  Well at least when my ovaries wanted to ovulate since I never got my period every month.  I was recently told the reason why I was in such pain because I was PCOS.)\\n\\nWhat is throwing me off with her is that she gets her period evey month.  I never did.\\n\\nAlso, when I was pregnant with her I was dx with Pregnancy diabetes.  I dont know if that is a factor.\\n\\ni just dont want her to suffer for YEARS like I did.  Even though she is regular with her periods could it still be PCOS?\\nEven though I was dx with this condition I still dont know alot about it.\\nThanks\\nit is possible for your daughter to be getting a period every month and still have pcos. when one has pcos (like i do) she does not ovulate regularly but may still have a regular perriod.\\ndon't worry about the fact that you had gestational diabetes when you were pregnant with her. that does not affect her chances. i am pregnant right now and have gd and at my diabetes education class i was told that it won't put my baby at risk in the future.\\nthe best thing to do is have her obgyn run some blood tests to check for her LH and FsH levels and maybe do an ultrasound to check for cysts on the ovaries. i hope that helps and that you find the answers you need.\\nIt's a possiblity however if your daughter is ovulating every month she will not be diagnosed with PCOS because one of the main criteria for diagnosing PCOS is anovulatory more than 6 months.\\nUnfortunatly I cant get her into my OB because my Ob is not on her insurance.  So now I have to try to find an OB that I can trust.\\n\\nI know that I did not ovulate evey month.  I never got my period evey month, and after I had my daughter which will be 19 years ago in May, when I did ovulate I was in such horrible pain I found out the reason why I was in such pain was because I was full of cysts.\\nI have herd that there are different variations of PCOS.  I am still very confused with this whole syndrome.  I just dont want my daughter to suffer like I did.\\nit is possible that your daughter has PCOS i was diagnosed ( a few months ago) and have a period every month they but the length and flow isn't consistant. Hope you find out soon.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi everyone\\n\\nI\\'ve been ill for a while with an \"unknown\" illness, which last year was diagnosed as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, despite an absence of most of the criteria needed for such a diagnosis.  This week I finally saw a consultant who spotted something wrong with one of my test results.  My LH:FSH ratio is about 4:1, which apparently is extremely indicative of PCOS.  I\\'m having some more tests and an ultrasound scan next week to confirm the diagnosis.\\n\\nWhat I\\'m wondering though is whether this diagnosis accounts for all my symptoms and if anyone officially diagnosed with PCOS could enlighten me?  For about a year before my periods went all weird, I started feeling increasingly tired and very cold (I have almost permanently cold hands and feet).  I also sleep more than I used to - I used to be more on the insomniac side, but now I can sleep right around from 9pm til 6am and at weekends sleep as long as 12 hours!  Are these or can they be symptoms of PCOS?  All I can find elsewhere on the \\'net is about excessive hair growth, weight gain etc.\\n\\nkiya\\nHi Kiya! :waves:\\n\\nBefore I was diagnosed, I was tired all the time too (still am to some degree). I think it has to do with your blood glucose levels. The PCOS affects your entire endocrine system, so lots of different hormones are messed up, not just female ones. Insulin is a hormone, and I was diagnosed as insulin resistant. My doc said this means that my body doesn\\'t respond well to my own insulin: I produce enough, but my receptors don\\'t recognize it. The result is that your body\\'s cells don\\'t get the glucose they need, because insulin helps transport glucose (energy from food) into cells from the blood. So you\\'re tired all the time because even though you may eat everythign in sight, you\\'re not getting enough energy from the food. I also had cold hands and feet, I think that has to do with decreased circulation or something related to the insulin thing. Do you get shaky if you don\\'t eat for a few hours?\\n\\nPCOS is a syndrome that isn\\'t completely understood by doctors, so try not to be too frustrated if things seem confusing. I was diagnosed last Monday, so you\\'re not alone. Take care and let us know what you find out!\\n\\nSally\\nHi Sally\\n\\nI must admit that at the moment I\\'m just relieved to have a consultant who actually believes there\\'s something wrong with me.  I saw a consultant in February who was quite dismissive: \"think positively and it\\'ll all go away\" - he actually said that to me!  I couldn\\'t believe it.  He even suggested cognitive behaviour therapy, antidepressants and graded exercise.  He spent most of the consultation trying to get me to admit I was depressed, which isn\\'t the case.\\n\\nIt\\'s interesting to know that PCOS affects the entire endocrine system.  I do get shaky if I haven\\'t eaten.  It\\'s all very confusing and it\\'s good to know that someone else has experienced the tiredness with it.  I\\'m so glad that it looks as if I\\'m now well on my way to being diagnosed and treated and not being dismissed as a hypochondriac by my GP and consultants!\\nI know what you mean about feeling like a hypochondriac. It\\'s not a good feeling, especially when you know something is wrong and no one seems to be able to figure it out. I\\'m glad you\\'re on your way to feeling better.\\nI just wanted to mention this whole chronic fatigue thing - I totally thought I had it too before being diagnosed with PCOS. I also had seen several doctors who could not tell me what was wrong (constant bleeding for months at a time) until I finally met a fertility doctor who told me what I had. I was interested by this dirty neck thing ... I feel like I have eczema behind my neck, always dry and sometimes itchy. I don\\'t have diabetes and when I was pregnant, did not get gestational diabetes. Can this be a symptom of PCOS too?\\n\\nI saw the gynaecologist this week.  Apparently I don\\'t have PCOS, so he\\'s at a loss to explain my irregular periods, cold hands/feet and fatigue.  He suggested I may have Raynauld\\'s Syndrome and that perhaps I\\'m doing too much as the causes of the latter two symptoms.  I told him I think they\\'re all connected, but he didn\\'t think so.  Absolutely bizarre.  I\\'m now back at square one after almost 2 years of being ill.\\n\\nHave you had your thyroid tested at all?\\nDear kiya,\\n\\nJust wanted to chip in here.  i have polycistic ovaries. but the gyny i saw said it did not cause all the other wierd symptons i was having. They thought i had chronic fatigue at first. i was having weight loss rashes tired ness bad circulation skin problems. turns out i have lupus and sticky blood syndome. Lupus thrives on hormones as well. im not sure now which symptons are cuasing what but the gynocologist said half my problems would not be caused pcos. I don\\'t want to scare you im still confused about what is causing what in me. but raynauds is a sympton of something like lupus. you could get some more blood tests done. My symptons got really bad before i was dianosed and wish i had some bloods done years earlier. Im probably completly wrong but you should get yourself checked out anyway.\\n\\n\\nlove zorm\\n\\nYes, a few times, all within \"normal limits\".  I\\'ve recently had a test for thyroid antibodies, the last test that may indicate some kind of thyroid problem (and one which my GP wouldn\\'t do, so I\\'ve paid to have it done).\\n\\nzorm - thanks for your reply.  I\\'m not sure I want to go through any more blood tests.  I\\'m hoping the thyroid antibodies test will show something, otherwise for the moment I\\'m just going to live with it.  The only thing that bothers me is I\\'m hoping to start a uni course in Medicine in September and I don\\'t want to feel washed out before I begin each day!!',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hello everyone and boy, am I glad I have found you.  Please forgive my duplicate posting - I have posted this message on the Thyroid board as well as I am so desperate for help and advice.\\n\\nLong story coming up:\\n\\nEver since my late teens I have suffered from continual tiredness, as well as weight problems, but my active lifestyle meant that my weight never got too serious. I\\'d cycle to college, do a lot of sport at college, then come home at four pm and sleep for two hours before carrying on with the rest of my evening.\\n\\nAs I got older, however, and my family got bigger, it became harder and harder to stay at a healthy weight. After my third child was born, I was diagnosed hypothyroid, following a bout of PPT. Eureka - NOT!! Blood tests were lost, notes were lost, and, by the time I had been diagnosed, I had put on three stone (42 lbs) and my long dormant PCOS also came into play.\\n\\nSince then, although I gained a brief respite after taking up running (but then my body adjusted) my weight has spiralled right out of control. I started to put onw eight again whilst TTC my fourth child - still a runner (3 miles a day - every day) and when I got pregnant, I became so very ill with hyperemesis that I could no longer go running. During my pregnancy, my weight stayed quite stable, but, after my son was born, my weight just snowballed - rapidly. The endo I was seeing at the time told me that \\'No-one in Belsen ever got fat!\\' and that I could always just NOT eat!! Hardly useful advice.\\n\\nBut it has now got to the point where I am almost too fat to move. I weigh 18st 8lbs - 260lbs. On a size 5\\'7\" frame that gives me a BMI of over 40. And serious health issues, as you can imagine.\\n\\nSo, over the last few weeks - and not for the first time, obviously - I have been extremely careful about my eating (and I confess, I am not always so good), and, initially, dropped a few pounds. Not for long, though, back they came! Last night, I went to the local GP diet clinic. Forgive me, but I am going to cut and paste what I have written elsewhere about that experience:\\n\\n\\n\\nAs you can see, I am having real issues with this, and, after seven years of hell, it is only my kids that make my life worth living.\\n\\nNow, it has been suggested to me that I don\\'t convert T4 to T3. I started taking 20mcg T3 whilst pregnant when my T3 levels dropped right down and I was hospitalised. I still take it, along with 175 mcg T4. I may also need Metformin (Glucophage) which I took before my last pregnancy, to sort out the insulin resistant part of the equation.\\n\\nI am due to see my new endo tomorrow, at a different hospital, and have been searching the web frantically for help this evening. If anyone can help, please, please, do write something. I have to come out of my appointment tomorrow with a glimmer of hope, or I don\\'t know what I am going to do.\\n\\nThanks for reading.\\n__________________\\nThanks for sharing yoour story.  I also have PCOS and was recently diagnosed with hypothyroid.  I actually self diagnosed my PCOS before it was confirmed by my doctor.  I knew that all the problems I had were not normal and there had to be a connection.  With every physical and pap smear I would complain but was always told to take BCP and join Weight Watchers.  I even had my doctor jokingly tell me once that it was all the Spanish food I ate.  That comment through me for a loop because I starved myself and excerised every day just to be a size 8. However there did come a point where I became, as best as I can describe, more in control of it.  Both my internal medicine doctor and my gyno died in plane crashes, which was a set back after finding doctors who would listen to me but I am educated on PCOS so even with the tragic loss of both doctors I felt still in control.  However this recent diagnosis of Hypothyroid has thrown me for a loop.  I\\'m just learning about it and I feel like I\\'ve lost control of my body.  I guess I\\'m grateful to know that my recent out of control weight gain has an explanation, but I\\'m terrified of the unknowns.  I have an appointment with an Endocronologist on Monday, I hope to feel a little better and gain some of that control back.',\n",

       " {'post': \"Hey everyone. I have been diagnosed with PCOS for about a year now. About a month ago i was prescribed Metformin and Spironolactone, at first 1 tablet of both a day. Just last week i upped my dosage to 2 metformin one spironolactone. Earlier this week i showed some negative side effects. I couldn't eat too much and my calorie intake was low. Later that night i fainted becasue of low blood sugar. Has anyone had this side effect? IF so let me know and tell me what you do to avoid this. Thanks!\\nI recently was diagnosed with PCOS and was placed on Metformin.  The first week I was taking it once a day, week two twice a day, and beginning week three three times a day.  To be honest taking the med three times a day knocks me on my a**.  I don't even want to think about food let alone eat it.  And becuase of my non-existant appetite I get the shakes, dizzy spells, etc.  I spoke to the doctor and he explained that this is the many side-effects and will hopefully subside as your body adjusts. How long have you been Metformin? I'm not to sure about the other med that you are on, but I hope this helps.  Keep us posted.\\n\\nJennypoo\\nTHanks for your reply! I have been on Metformin for about a month that is when i upped my dosage to 2. Know i have decreased my dosage to 1.5 pills of metformin. Spironolactone helps with high blood pressure, acne etc. Since i didn't eat that much during the day, when i took the meds it slowly decreased my blood pressure(my dad is a doctor). Over the past few days i have felt more fatigued, moody, nauseous, weak and dizzy everytime i stand up. I don't know how i am going to keep eating and staying on these medications because i feel nauseous everytime i see food. I am glad that other people are going through the same complications! Thanks for the support.\\nMy daughter has recently started taking both of these meds for PCOS.  She is 20 years old and about 20 lbs. overweight.  But she doesn't have high blood pressure and the jury is still out on her blood sugar test.  She is up to one Metformin in the am and one in the pm with just one Spiro at night.  She did mention a little dizziness the other day.  It just doesn't seem like a very good idea to take Metformin unless your blood sugar is too high, but I am certainly not a doctor.  Does anyone really understand how this medication that is supposedly for glucose control help with PCOS?  Does it regulate the ovaries somehow?  Thanks.\\nCindy\\nI was diagnosed with PCOS over a year ago, although I knew I had it doctors said I didnt as I have had children! It was discovered as I was also diagnosed with diabetes Of which the chances of getting are increased if you have PCOS.\\nOver 10 years my weight went from 11 stone up to 17st 10lbs - no matter what I ate! I am now on metformin 3 times daily and spironolactone for High BP. I have lost almost 3 stone, but it is very hard to lose weight because of the fluctuating blood sugar levels concerned with pcos and diabetes. If you can regulate your sugar levels, you can lose weight and other symtoms of pcos can improve too, eg periods/ excess hair.\\nYou need to regulate your sugar intake by eating low carbs. The GI diet is very good. Also, you must eat several regular small meals/snacks every day about every 3 hours, this should keep your blood sugar level and help to stop dizzy spells. Drinking plenty of water and exercise also helps.\\n( I once missed out on breakfast so my sugar levels were low, but I still took my metformin tablet which made my levels lower - I passed out at work!\\nYou just have to retrain yourself to stick to the diet and eat sensibly and often whilst on these pills.\\n\\nI am new to the metformin myself and have some of the side effects you are describing...when i mentioned it to my dr. she said its not from the met (which i totally disagree with) i found if i eat small frequent meals i feel much better...and if its too late and i am already feeling dizzy, shaky i eat something with sugar ie glass of oj (almost like a diabetic when they have a large drop in their blood sugars)\\n\\nI also have normal bld sugars before the metformin, if not on the low end...but i was told the metformin will help regulate my hormones ...and i can't find hte words to describe it.  You should go online and so some searches...if you haven't already...their is TONNES of info out there  8o)\\n\\nGL\\nI'm nervous now. I was on one spiro a day and was lightheaded and now I am up to 2 a day a month ago and yesterday was put on one metformin a day. I was getting dizzy with just the one spiro I can't wait to see what the next month will be like!\\nOh and one thing, I don't have diabetes or problems with my blood sugar, is there another reason to take metformin?\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I am 18 and me and my boyfriend have been having unprotected sex for nearly a year now, however we always use the \"pull out\" method and I realize this is a risk. I believe however, my risk of getting pregnant is low, I have very irregular periods due to ovarian cysts. I am afraid I now might be pregnant. There has been a handful of times where he hasnt pulled out throught out the relationship and everything was fine, no pregnancies. Then last thursday during my period, more towards the end of it he did not pull out. For a day my period has passed, then I began bleeding randomly, 1-3 times a day for the passed 2 days, its slightly heavy, not quite as heavy as my period, but just bleeds for a moment or two and stops.\\n\\nToday is the third is Ive spotted heavily once but Im thinking its over with...Would it be a sign of implantation? I also feel a sharp quick pain every so often in my ovaries each time the bleeding occurs, then the pain goes away, but I still feel some cramps throughout the day. I also get VERY moody about 3 days before my period...And Im still very moody, this is almost a week after my period. Im very confused, how likely is it for me to be pregnant? Or perhaps do I have a severe ovarian problem? I would appriciate any information dealing with any of the aforementioned subjects, thank you!\\n\\nUpdate: The bleeding has stopped, although I still have soft ovarian pain..COuld it be heavy spotting from implantation or morelikely ruptured cysts? Please someone give me more info on PCOS..My doctor did not help! I want to have children so badly..But I dont know how much longer my body will allow me to wait!\\nAlso, a few days before my \"assumed\" period, I had crippling pain in my ovaries that lasted 3 days and left me bed ridden for a day...I was on painkillers during the time and even 2 vicodin did not remove all of the pain. Yeah........Im hella confused...\\nOH and about 2-3 weeks ago I took a pregnancy test that turned up negative, and for about a week and a half Ive been urinating freqeuently..Sometimes I urinate very frequently, othertimes its almost normal but still alittle more than normal..Ive had an on going headache for a couple days, but I get those from time to time so it doesnt really mean anything =\\\\\\nMy mood swings are irradical...and why the crap cant anyone have anything to say about this? Theres gotta be someone here that has had a ruptured cyst...=(\\nI recently had a cyst rupture and it bled internally.  I can guarantee if you are going about your routine with some discomfort, your cyst did not rupture.  The pain is unreal, you cannot walk, you cannot stand nor lie down.  As for the \"pull out\" method, I suggest you go on birth control.  Having a baby is not going to cure any problems but create a lot at your age.  You have plenty of time, having cysts does not make you infertile.  Also going on birth control will help regulate your monthly.\\nI did have horrible and unbelievable discomfort, cant stand nor lie down unless I was on painkillers, even then they didnt help much, a week later I had odd bleeding and have been in discomfort ever since..Could it be a possible miscarridge? I hope not..\\nI recently had 2 cysts burst and was extremley painfull. ended up in the emergency room.  cysts can cause frequent urination if they are big enough because they put pressure on the bladder. how long after your period did you take the pregnancy test. I had a weird month after i got pregnant with my first child.  (short period, spotting, and cramping.) Call your doctor ASAP and get a checkup. This will let you know what is actually going on and they can do a blood test to check for pregnancy. for now try a warm bath and put warm towels ( not to hot until you know if you are pregnant) in a ziplock bag and lay them on your stomach or back to help the pain a little.           lots of luck\\nThere is a lot of info on net about pcos that explains the ins and outs. a general search will bring up a large number of websites. Is your doc an OB/GYN. IF he/she will not listen to you or answer your questions it may be a good idea to find another. An OB/GYN is probably your best bet.\\n',\n",

(i stopped mid pack, and got my period immediately after)  well, wouldnt u know it.. i started spotting  on the exact day that i was supposed to get my period this month and it hasnt stopped!!! its been 11 days so far. no full on period again. brownish/light red blood enough to use just one pad a day. how do i stop this?? i dont want to go back on birth control (ive tried many many brands and they all make me nauseous) ive also started breaking out.  my boyfriend thinks its just my body getting used to the hormones.  i dont know if the pcos is coming back or what.  i feel like going to the doc is a waste since all they ever seem to want to do is put me on birth control.  i asked for metformin from 2 different docs and they say theres no reason for me to take it unless im trying to conceive.\\n\\nany opinions?  is this really pcos? why are my levels normal if it is? could it just be that i was really skinny at the time they tested me years ago?  does pcos ever \\'go away\\'?  my doc took one look at me and said i dont fit the profile (im thin with no other symptoms but the spotting) and she even said that just because my ultrasound showed cysts it doesnt mean its pcos.  im confused. what tests will actually PROVE that i have it?\\n\\nsorry so long i just have a lot of questions about this. if i really have it i wanna treat it.  thanks =)\\nyou could be like me and have some polycystic ovaries, but not the syndrome. that is what i was told. my periods are early sometimes but i ovulate, on my u/s i had 6 on one side and 9 on the other, they told me ppl with bad pcos can have up to like 40.. my hormones are normal, and i need to lose weight (but like 10lbs) did they test to make sure u are ovulating?? that is important.. just b/c ur bleeding a lil each month doesnt mean ur ovulating.  did they test u for testosterone?? but trust me u dont want to take metformin.. u should also have a blood glucose test to test for insulin resistance, if u do have insulin resistance then u might consider metformin.  it doesnt make u feel good, bad gi problems, nausea, diarrhea!! its not something u want to take if u dont have too... i hope i helped a lil!! good luck\\n\\nwhat test is that to make sure you are ovulating? the only tests ive had done are the ultrasound and the lh,fsh, testosterone, dhea.  the last time i tested they came out all normal.  my glucose levels are all within normal range. i did a fasting insulin level and it came out LOW (which is opposite what it should be if i had insulin resistance right?)  thats why my current doctor is so baffled.\\n\\nit DOES make me feel better to know that my ovaries arent that bad if people have up to 40 cysts though! my sister has pcos but her hormone levels are all totally out of range (testosterone and dhea are both way high) and she used to only get her period once a year.\\n\\nso if we dont have the actual syndrome, then whats the significance of the cysts in the ovaries? does that still lead to infertility? could this be the reason for my constant spotting (still going.. day 12 showing no signs of stopping) is there something i should be doing to monitor the cysts?\\n\\nany input is much appreciated =) !!\\nWow, Ur Dr Is Pretty Thorough Then That He Did All Those Tests... I Was Told That The Significant Of The Cysts, Is That Even Tho I Ovulate Reguraly A \"bad Egg\" Can Still Makeits Way Out And Then If It Fertilizes The Chances Of Misscarraige Are Higher.. Or If The Cysts Get Worse Then They Just Might Not Come Out And I Will Stop Ovulating.. I Need Ivf Anyway Bc Of Male Factor Infertilty, But They Want Me On All These Meds To Try And Get My Eggs The Best They Can Be B4 We Do Ivf... Good Luck 2 U!!!\\nI just wanted to jump in here because I can relate to the confusion about this syndrome and doubting the diagnosis.  My only symptom was no period for 5 months after getting off the pill.  I am very thin, never had a problem with hair or acne (although, I had been on the pill for many years - since I was 18).  I too had all those tests and for me, my lh was 2x higher than fsh, but not outrageously high; my free testosterone, dhea and prolactin were all normal, but my total test. was slightly elevated, but \"not like usually seen with pcos\" as my doc put it.  My fasting insulin was low and upon ultrasound, there were no cysts and my ovaries were not enlarged at all.  Of course, this is all very confusing and I am constantly worrying that symptoms will suddenly appear.  I keep thinking my hair is falling out now - but I don\\'t know if it\\'s just because I\\'m looking for it to fall out because I know that is a symptom.  Every little blemish I get, I think, oh oh, maybe my testosterone is high today!  I am back on the pill (Yasmin) per my doc\\'s recommendation, and not a day goes by where I don\\'t analyze my body for symptoms.  I just wanted to give my support because I know first hand how confusing it is.  I guess we can\\'t make it out to be worse than it is though.  I know people who do have pcos and just go about their lives without thinking about it.  I sure wish I could do that!',\n",

       " {'post': \"My husband and I have been trying to conceive for 7 months now with no luck, and after some blood tests and a doctor visit, he told me I have a high level of testosterone (possibly PCOS) which is probably the culprit of the problem we have been having.\\n\\nI ovulate every month, but at different times, and I get my period regularly every 28 days, although over the past few months the bleeding flow has been getting lighter and lighter.\\n\\nThe doctor said if I lose weight (I'm 75kg and 160cm tall) it will sort itself out, and my fertility will return to normal.\\n\\nI hadn't really heard about this before, so I looked it up on google and there were all these websites saying that it causes permanent infertility.\\n\\nHas anyone else managed to conceive while having PCOS or high testosterone levels, or lost weight and have everything return to normal? I'm really worried because I would love to have a baby, and it's really upsetting to think that I'll never be able to.\\n\\nMy doctor also said that I have a high level of something else in my blood, which can be caused by a benign (spelling??) brain tumor, which presses on something in my brain and releases too many of this certain hormone, but he said that some months women can jut get a freak high reading for some reason and it's about half the time it's nothing, so I'm getting the test done again next month to make sure. Has anyone else had this happen?\\n\\nThanks guys! I'm just feeling a bit freaked out at the moment, and want to know exacty what my chances are of getting pregnant if I have either or both of these problems.\\nHello!  It is scary when you find out information that you do not understand, (and doctors do not tell you much about it).  I have PCOS and very high test levels.  I had no periods at all, facial hair since I was a teen, overweight.  I had 2 perfectly healthy children who are now 12 and 13.  I feel I was very lucky and very blessed to of had 2 children.  One thing hubby and I did.. And I know this might be hard for you to do such as lifestyles are.... Was...\\nHad sex everyday, 3-4 times a day.  I was pregnant within a few months.  Since I had no period, no idea at all when or if I even ovulated we had unprotected sex, (thinking there was no way I was going to become pregnant).  But it happened.\\n\\nThe doctor saying about loosing weight...\\nEverything in society today is blamed on weight.  I get tired of hearing it.. If I lost weight would I not get cancer too?  With PCOS weight gain is a symptom and very difficult to loose it as you have to keep on a strict diet.\\n\\nWho you should really be seeing is an endocrinologist.  They have more experience with this sort of thing than a normal doctor.  I went through years and years of testing and my normal doctor found nothing.  Even with an ultrasound of the ovaries.  I went to a female endocrinologist and she said even though the ultrasound did not show cysts, just with the symptoms alone, she said I had it.  Indeed she was right when I had to have a hysterectomy.. There they were.. Cysts that did not show up on ultrasound.  Anyhow, for weight loss she put me on glucophage.  With some it helps them loose weight right away..   PCOS is controlled by diabetes.  Sort of adds fuel to the fire.  And the glucophage helps bring your sugar levels back into the normal numbers.  She also put me on spironolatone for the hair growth on my face.  It slowed it down some but I still have to shave everyday.. *ugh!*\\n\\nSo don't give up..  Just see another doctor and hopefully it will be an endocrinologist.\\n\\nGood luck!\\n\\nMichelle\\nI was diagnosed with pcos myself while trying to concieve (atlho i suspected it long ago but dr refused to rn tests)\\nneways....there is a really good drug out there called metformin...its perscribed to diabetics but has shown it works wonders with women with pcos ttcing....you should mention it to your dr.\\n\\nThey also thought pcos for me because my testosterone was high and my DHEAS (i think that is the other one you weren't sure the name of as i had to hvae a serrum test done to make sure i didn't have the tumour) and then yesterday they did a internal u/s that should tonnes of cysts on my ovaries..\\nOhh to help loose some weight i suggest a low carb diet...try to eat no sugar or refined carbohydrates...apparently it helps....\\n\\nGOod luck!!\\nWell, I was diagnosed with PCOS back in December of 2005 and of course I was crushed.  My husband does not have any children of his own and I would love to bring a child in this world together.  So,the doctor put me on bc for 3 months and at the end of March 2006 he put me on Met (1500mg) a day and I'm really anxious.  I am overweight and have lost 11 lbs so far in the last 3 months.  It's a slow process, but I'm trying.  I'm feeling a little frustrated having to take these pills every night; a total of 4 (3 Mets and 1 prenatal).  I don't know of anyone personally with this disease so I decided to join healthboards for answers and especially support from those experiencing the same thing.  I welcome all replies...\\n\\nP.S.  Does anyone know the shortest time frame for anyone to get pregnant taking Met alone?\\nHI everyone~! I'm here to offer hope to those that have PCOS and are worried about TTC.  I was officially diagnosed in 2003 - but I've known I had it since in HS when my periods were never regular.\\n\\nI was placed on Metformin ER (1,000mg) in Feb. 2004 and have been on it ever since.  My husband and I weren't using birth control during the past 2 years - but also not actively trying - by which I mean - we weren't timing my ovulation day, etc.\\n\\nIn January, I got really serious about tracking my ovulation.  I have 32 day cycles and found that I ovulate on day 21 almost every month.  I used the OPKs and they worked great.\\n\\nI got pregnant in March after only 2 full cycles of actively trying.  I must say I was very, very shocked. I thought it would take years.\\n\\nSo - please don't worry and be positive.  Metformin ER is a wonder drug.  It allowed me to have monthly regular cycles for the first time in my life and allowed me to get pregnant.  I am now 8 weeks and due in November!\\n\\nGood luck!\",\n",

Some people might see results earlier, but that is usually how long it takes to really take effect. As far as the cyst go, it is my understand that even if you can try and make them go away with Metformin, (or if you arent TTC'ing, BCP's), but that is something that will probably not go away. If you get them to shrink and go away, they could grow back, or develop in other areas. Metformin helps with that, because it deals with the underlying cause, insulin resistance. Hope that helps.\",\n",

I work with ladies that have lost hair due to medical treatment, and many of thenm are delighted with their wigs.\\nThe alternative is scarfs, or possibly hats you can get some quite trendy ones.\\nI know its not the same as your own hair, but hope i`m being of help.\\nI understand how devastating the thinning hair can be - it zaps your self confidence and leaves you feeling horrible about yourself.  There are some medications that can promote hair growth (or so I\\'ve read) so it may be worth checking into more with your dr (either the dermotologist or the endo).  I know you are saying you don\\'t want to try a wig, but if a hair piece is no longer working for you, maybe you should give it a try.  From what I hear, they are made MUCH better than they were years ago and they are comfortable.  At least you would then feel secure enough to go out in public and live your life.  I know it stinks and it\\'s really lousy that it\\'s happening to you, but don\\'t just hide away because of it.\\n\\nAs for the weight - take your time and do what works for you.  Hang in there - things will get better, and if they don\\'t, try to make them better so you can be happy\\n\\n\\nI wish you all the best and sincerely hope things work out for you\\n\\nPipsal,\\n\\nDo you remember what blood tests the endo ran for you?

I want to know if mood swings are also part of pcos and if so what is given for this? I am not depressed but happy one minute and crying another. I hate being this way and want to know if this is normal?\\nI don't know all the scientific facts behind mood swings and pcos but they are related.  Here is how my gyno has explained it to me.  Our bodies are constantly releasing hormones, estrogen and testosterone.  When we cycle our body flushes the hormones.  So for us PCOSers that don't cycle every month, our hormones are building up to outrageous levels.  Estrogen is the number one thing behind our mood swings that's why woman have more mood swings than men, we have more estrogen.  Because I am generally a very emotional person anyway, my gyno fears when I don't cycle atleast every 2 months.  I think my moods got him a little freaked when I went through some serious mood swings at my last visit.  I could be way off on this too but that's how I understand it to be.\\n\\nHope I helped!\\n\",\n",

I am wondering if this is even connected to PCOS or a separate issue.  It just feels awful to be incapable of such a thing.  Please give me your opinions.\\nHello there, I haven't posted in quite a while but was struck by your post.  I know exactly how you feel about having an orgasm as being almost impossible.  I found out that I had PCOS about 3 years ago at the age of 20 after I became engaged.  After I got married I was hurt to find that not only was it hard to have an orgasm but that my sexual drive just wasn't there.  As a teenager it was only normal for me to have some kind of sexual thoughts, now it just seems like a chore.  I was very disturbed and at my 6 month check up I asked the doctor, she told me that until my body get back in the full groove of my hormones being in check, having a period every month, and the like I wasn't going to be in the mood like at all.  And not to discourage you, but I really don't feel this at all now.  My problem is that my doctors and I haven't been able to come up with an appropriate treatment for my PCOS as of yet.  I have had some severe reactions to many of the more typical prescriptions.  But I haven't given up hope.  I have to say I'm trying to be the best fighter I can.  Good Luck to you and keep me updated!\\n\\n\\nHmm....that is not great news.....awful to hear that it never got any better\\nThere are also times when I feel pain down there during intercourse.  Do you go through the same thing?  I hope things do get better for you as I still feel hopeful for myself.\\n\\nThanks for replying.\\ni haven't personally seen a link between my pcos and orgasms but i'm not totally sure of the answer either.\\nI have had the same problems, but only when I am married...When I was single I didn't have to worry about sex unless I wanted it, but I firmly believe that pcos and sex have alot in common...I can't have an orgasim unless I help myself achieve it during intercourse...but have you been checked for diabetes? I found that to be a true side effect of having the disease...I have been a diabetic for almost 10 years now and to have sex is a chore...BUT I also believe that its a mind thing....Have you tried sexual councelling? Sometimes when hormones are out of wack sex for a woman is very difficult..that is why my doctor suggested seeing a sex therapist...maybe we are missing something that we don't know about???\\n\",\n",

I have taken Metformin, the side effects do go away by the second or third month.  I used Metformin in place of BCP when I was trying to get pregnant.\\n\\nETA: If you are trying to lose weight, Metformin will definitely help.\\nI was on Yasmin for three years and stopped in August in the TTC race when I recently found out that I have PCOS.

However, now I am on Metformin and I do agree it does make me feel crap** but from what the doctor explained, it will take a few months for my body to get used to the meds.  You might consider asking the doctor to stop the Metformin and see what Yasmin can do for you for a while.  The worst case scenerio is you will have to go back on it.

She was doing ok and had increased her dose to one Metformin in the a.m. and another in the p.m.  She came down with a respiratory infection and had to start an antibiotic.  Well, I guess the combination was just too much for her and she threw up all day and had to come home from work.  I told her she HAD to take the antibiotic to get over her infection, so just stop the Metformin for a couple of days, so that's what she did.  I was wondering how long it takes for these medications for PCOS to work?  She came home in tears yesterday saying she felt like she couldn't get along with anyone anymore.  I guess she feels like she's in perpetual PMS!  I called my pharmacy who also gives advice on vitamins, supplements, and natural medicine and they prescribed some vitamin B-12 and SAM-E.  They said both would help with the moodiness.  I just wish she could start her period.  She hasn't had it since November, and I know she is miserable.  I just wish the medications would help soon.\\nCindy\\nOnce I was diagnosed with PCOS my OB put me on Yasmin and Metformin.

Once the thyroid issues are done then I'll be back on Yasmin and Metformin (it takes about 2 - 3 months to kick in) until my husband and I are ready to conceive.  Then, no more BCP and only Metformin since it'll help with conceiving and prevent miscarriage.\\n\\nDon't know if that helped, but that's all the information I have...\\n~RomyD\\nI was on Yasmin for 4 months and got my periods each month but my blood pressure was very high because of it and now I'm on spironolactone and metformin and haven't had a period yet.

Not having pms has been great!\\nI'll tell you this if you are trying to get pregnant It does not say if you are or not, but if you are stick with it I took Metformin 500mg 3x a day and after 9 month I was pregnant. My only child was born 12 yrs ago with the use of clomid. My second is due beginning of OCT\\nI personally had way too much trouble with the met.  I was so sick and my doctor kept giving me more and more meds to counteract the side effects, I stopped taking them.  I went to a new doctor, gave him the whole medical rundown of everything, and he started me on Byetta, which from my understanding in researching this med, works just like the met does, only no side effects for me, or at least no bad ones.  This new med has about demolished my appetite.  I have to eat about half an hour after I take it but I'm not hungry.  I don't think I eat even half as much as I used to, and I feel so stuffed all the time.  My doctor adviced that most people he has put on this has lost over 30lbs within the first 2 months.  I have only been on this a week but I can already tell it is doing the trick.  I have a lot of weight to loose so I'm more than thrilled with the weightloss.  And I can tell my cycles are starting to move again.  I used to go on average 4 months between cycles.  I just had one, and I can feel my body working on another one.  So that will make 2 in a row.  I haven't had that happen in over 2 years.  So if the met is causing mega problems, talk to the doc, there are other answers out there.\\nI've been on metformin since Jan 1 and Byetta since February 15.  The Metformin has really helped me.  I went a year with absolutely no period and then a year with two.  As soon as I started taking the metformin, I've been getting my period regularly.  Both medicines made me really sick at first, for about a month.  I felt really nauseaus and full all the time but forced myself to take it. Eventually it will go away.  Now, I feel fine after taking them.\\nI went off the Yasmin and am now taking my thyroid meds and the metformin.  I take it at night and it helps with the side effects immensely.\\n\\n\\nWhen I first started taking Metformin, it made me so sick that I thought I had a stomach flu.  THEN, I realized it was because I wasn't taking it right.\\nNot before or during.  Sounds minor, but that makes a WORLD of difference.\",\n",

I have not been diagnosed with PCOS yet, but I took a quiz and scored in the level that most women with PCOS score in and I have almost all of the symptoms.  I am obese, have irregular periods, pain in my ovaries, problems swelling, high blood pressure, and a history of female problems in my family.  The quiz that I took was scored by if you had a symptom it gave you a point, and the more points the higher risk of PCOS.  Two of the things that I have a big problem with was actually two points a piece like it was one of the main symptoms.  I am wondering if anyone else has problems with these.\\n\\nMy first problem...skin tags.  I have a few on my neck, one in between my legs, one on my back, and several under my arms.  I have so many under my arms that it looks like little patches clustered together.  I have more under my right arm then my left. I also have one on my eyelid.  Does anyone know what causes these? The quiz that I took called them hormonal growths.  Is this true?  I have also heard that they can be removed.  How do you get them removed, do they hurt, and how do you prevent them from coming back?\\n\\nMy second problem...dark skin patches.  My doctor told me its called Acanthosis Nigracian having to do with high sugar levels. I have it on the back of my neck, my knees, elbows, under my arms, and the worse spot is on my inner thighs/bikini areas. The skin is very dark and feels very smooth. It almost looks like the skin is dirty but it will not go away. My doc told me that loosing weight would make it go away...is this true, and are these signs of PCOS?\\n\\nAre these big signs of PCOS?  Does anyone else have them, and how can I get rid of them or make sure they don't come back?  It is very embarrasing to me! I would appreciate any help that anyone can offer me in sharing their experiences!\",\n",

       " {'post': \"I was wondering if anyone has taken this drug for hair loss due to high levels of testosterone?  Can someone tell me if it will work and if the drug is safe.\\n\\nThanks~\\nHi, hope I still can help.  I have been taking Aldactone for a year and a half.  It is a potassium absorber, so one of the risks is having too much potassium in your system.  It has greatly helped me with facial/body hair, acne, oily skin and other over production of androgen-related symptoms.  It always can cause breast enlargement, which can be annoying or not, depending.\\nAldactone can make you slightly drowsy and if you mix it with alcohol you might start to feel like you could fall asleep anywhere at any time.\\n\\nI avoid alcohol and try to get enough sleep always.  Exercise helps a lot with energy levels.  I was prescribed Aldactone with Diane, but have stopped taking Diane (due to weight gain) and now am just on Aldactone.  So, we shall see!\\nGood luck!\\n\\n\\n\\ncan someone update this? i have high test, dhea and free test levels and hair loss as well as pcos sympoms - oily skinm, acne, facial hair around chin, and difficulty losing weight / skipped periods. Im having a hard time getting aNY doctor to prescribe ANYTHING\\n\\nI recommend seeing an Endocrinologist.  Chances are a regular doctor will not even mess with this......at least that was my experience.  I have PCOS and was diagnosed by a Reproductive Endocrinologist.........which I would recommend if you are planning on having children.  PCOS has many many symptoms including all of the symptoms that you are experiencing.  I have all of your symptoms, plus some.  Good luck.\\nHi, Sorry to butt in the post, just had a couple questions of my own!!  I have some of yall symptoms, tired all the time, weight gain that I can't lose no matter what diet or exercise plan I do, hair on upper lip & chin.  I have had two children & a tubal.  I did not have any of these problems until about a year ago.  I went to an endo, they checked thyroid, it was o,k.  He said I was depressed!!  Went to my gyno, he did blood work & said my hormones were out of balance.  He put me on birth control about four mnths ago.  I am STILL gaining weight!!  I still have the excess hair, I am still tired just not quite as bad!!  Wondering if I may have PCOS or if it is related to hormone imbalance.  Could this med. help me?  Does it help with the weight?????\\nPCOS is a hormonal problem and there are many different ways to treat it.  Many doctors prescribe BCP and something like Aldactone (Spironolactone).  Many women are put on Metformin.  The meds do help out a lot, as well as diet.  Your best bet would be to see a specialist and try to get a diagnosis because what you are experiencing is not normal.\\nDo you know which hormones are out of whack?  The two things I know of besides thyroid that can cause similar symptoms are pcos (the most common) and cushings (pretty rare).  With pcos you might be insulin resistant and have high androgen levels.  With cushings you would have high cortisol and high androgen levels.\\nSpironolactone will just help lower testosterone and reduce annoying side effects like acne and unwanted hair.  If you have pcos, there are other things, like metformin, that can be helpful.\\nalready went to a derm, internist and endo. all 3 were totally useless\\n\\nI am seeing a woman endo/gyno who specializes in pcos next week, so hopefully I'll walk out w/ a prescription. I've been shedding hair for 2 months now and am petrified!!!!\\nUpdate : I have pcos! Enlarged right ovary and small 'follicles' on the left one\\n\\nI think im going on glucophate and yasmin....\\nGlad you have some answers!\\nNow that you have some answers...........research PCOS.  That is the best thing you can do for yourself.  There are some good resources on the internet as well as good books out there.  I too have PCOS and I have done a lot of research on it.  It really helps to understand what your body is going through.  Diet is a huge factor as well.  Following a healthy diet, taking your meds, having a good support system and just having the knowledge of how to deal and how to treat your PCOS is 100% the key to living with it.  It isn't always easy to manage, but it can be done.  Best of luck to you.\\nthanks guys, my sister has it and went through the same thing so we figured it out faster with me - im seeing my 6th doctor on friday in ny and going on whatever meds they suggest  - the hair loss is the big issue w me , everything else i can deal with.\\n\\nshe got pregnant 6 weeks after starting some drug to help - and her baby is now turning one  so  i have hope about getting pregnant some day!!!!\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I\\'ve been reading up on Polycystic(?)Ovarian Syndrome. From what I can come up with, I have many of the symptoms...large belly, hairy chin, cysts and acne on face.  I have had a few cysts from my ovaries removed over the years, and was told 5 years ago when I had my hysterectomy that I had another one, but they didnt remove it. Has anyone been diagnosed with this and how do you treat it? Can having your ovaries removed help?\\nHi - I have PCOS, and I have to tell you, it stinks LOL.  I have not had any cysts removed, but have been taking birth control off and on almost my whole adult life.  My cycles are horribly irregular if I don\\'t, and I am having a heck of a time getting pregnant.  Glucophage didn\\'t seem to help much, but I only took it for about 6 months.  My doctor is paranoid about giving out too much (what he feels) unneccesary medication.  Anyway, I constantly live in fear any time I have pain near either ovary.... i am scared to death about cancer.  so much so that i worry myself sick sometimes.  I am even afraid to go back to the doctor.  Crazy I know.... I have been having some pains over the last few weeks (more like pressure around my pelvis) but I am pretty sure that it had to do with my back being out of whack (maybe I am just trying to convince myself - LOL)A couple more visits to the chiropractor and I\\'ll know for sure.  If that doesn\\'t help, I guess I\\'ll have to drag myself to the gyno.  I haven\\'t heard anything about having ovaries removed as a treatment.  I am 34 and I too have all the symptoms you mentioned....\\nI do!  I do!  I have it!  It stinks (I agree with previous poster).\\n\\nThese are my symptoms:\\n-larger middle section\\n-adult onset acne\\n-painful ovaries\\n-dark ring of skin patches around neck\\n-insulin level elevated, but sugar level normal\\n-a raise in hormone levels\\n-Infertility\\n-Cysts on ovaries\\n-no ovulation\\n\\nMany doctors overlook this, so if you are not getting the attention you feel is needed, please please go to another doctor and have him/her listen to you.  Go to a PCOS website and print out the info.  Take it with you.  If they don\\'t know a lot about it, you show them.  A lot of them are starting to come around to it, but still....my gp knows very little whereas my OB and my Reproductive endocrinologist knows tons, so it is really a different case from doctor to doctor.  Even my OB did some blood tests, but didn\\'t know really much else to do.  My Reproductive Endocrinologist knew all the right tests to do and did them right away.  The biggest red flag done with tests so far has been the high level of insulin.  If your insurance does not require pre certification for things (or referals) I would suggest finding an endocrinologist and go to them.  That is who can order the proper tests.  (unless you are interested in having children and therefore you would want to go to a reproductive endocrinologist)  If you don\\'t know of a good one, call your insurance company.  They can suggest one.  If you need a referral, go to your OB and he or she can send you to one.  Good luck to you.  Take care of yourself and make sure to get this checked out.  If you do not get treatment, you can end up with Diabetes.  You REALLY do not want that.  The good thing is...a lot of women react well to the meds they can prescribe and they lose weight immediately.  So, that is a great initiative!  Please keep us updated because I will be thinking about you!  Do a search for PCOS on the net. You will find lots of support and good info.\\nAnd by the way...if you do not have all the symptoms...that does NOT mean you don\\'t have it.  You may only suffer from ONE symptom and still have it.  That is why you have to get it checked out!\\nit\\'s weird too because sometimes you might not even have cysts even thought the name includes it. i don\\'t know if i really have it actually. the doctor just strongly suspects it based on some of the symptoms i have. does anyone know about just having a mild case of this?\\nThat is very strange i think too. I would guess that the high hormone levels typically cause ovarian cysts, but not all the time.  I guess at any time you could \"potentially\" get cysts and hence the name.  I am no doctor though!\\n\\nEveryone I have talked to usually has quite a few symptoms, the most common being the middle weight gain.  That is the most miserable for me.  I have always been pretty small until the past few years.  Then boom...all this weight just piled on.  It is very depressing!  However I have heard that the weight can come off quickly if you get medicated properly.\\n\\nI would think, however, that you COULD have a mild case since you only have to have one symptom to be able to be diagnosed.  The best thing would be to call your doctor and have a blood test right away.  Remember...your doctor is working for you.  If they will not test you, move on to another doctor.  There is no reason to NOT do this simple blood test.\\n\\nGood luck to you all and keep me updated!\\nHi,\\nI too have most of the symptoms but also I have actually developed Diabetes!  I don\\'t know whether they are linked but most cases I have read say that they are.  PCOS is such a nasty thing as a lot of people don\\'t take it that serious but to a woman it can have a very hard impact.  I dread the day that I start trying for a baby cause that is the main thing that I would want.  It also messes with your emotions - which I hate!  Is it just me that feels this \"down\" and negative about having PCOS????\\nPlease dont stress people - ive been reading for weeks on this and its VERY MANAGEABLE!!!! The ONLY long term issue (aside from the general issues if its not treated) is pregnancy which can be dealt with easily (not guaranteed but VERY good success rates today) my sister has it, went on meds/treatment and was pregnant within 2 months, and ALL her sympotoms  cleared up. All the doctors her and I have seen are encouraging , there are many drugs to help the symptoms and keep the levels more balanced and all say diet, exercise, vitamins, lower carbs, and testing is a huge impact. They all were optomistic in terms of managing it - but get ALL the tests done as well as an ultrasound.\\ni have some of the symptoms, big belly, facial hair, irr. periods, severe pain but they only saw small cysts on my ultrasound, i was diabetic when pregnant and sometimes feel like my sugar goes high after i eat but then it goes back down after a couple of hours. also get very low sugar when i miss a meal. i also have polycystic kidney disease, how do they test and know for sure you have it? (pcos) also one gyn doctor i saw said i looked like i had x syndrome, i think its when your insulin resistant. does anyone have info on it?\\nyeah, symptoms can vary soooo much.\\nThe only symptoms I really had were irregular periods (they stopped for 6 months so i\\'m now on birth control and get them regularly), and severe adult-onset acne. I\\'m of normal weight and so the first endocrinologist I went to mentioned PCOS as a cause for acne but told me i didn\\'t have it because I was normal weight. But I went to the second endo who suspected PCOS again - I got an ultra sound confirming it.\\nI don\\'t know whether I\\'d be considered a mild case because I only have two symptoms...but my acne was severe (gone now that I\\'m using spironolactone).\\nel_9_el\\n\\nYou only take Birth control pills? u dont take metformin?  ARe u IR?\\ni only have amennorrhea as a symptom(i am in normal weight too) and  i take metformin and i\\'m not even IR\\nI\\'m on birth control. And am still on a bit of spironolactone for the acne (I\\'m in the process of weaning myself off it completely). Nope, I don\\'t take metformin and I\\'m not IR as far as I know. I had one fasting blood-test that showed my insuling levels are normal...but I\\'ve not had the tests that assess how your level changes with food. Why does your doctor think you should be on metformin?\\nCoz she said we have diabetes in our blood (my grandma and aunt has em) and i might be prone to having one ?!?!\\n\\nAnd i read about stuffs that metformin works even if ur not IR *shrug*\\nboth my endo and gyno said metformin wont do much if youre not ir, although i guess it couldnt hurt BUt my sister took it anyway and now is stuck on it and not sure what will happen when she goes off - she doesnt know if its that or the BCP or the new diet etc thats helping. I decided to just go on yasmin and change my diet/exersise /vitamin process, rather than getting on ANOTHER drug that im not even sure would work. I guess if  a year goes by and nothings improved maybe I\\'ll see about trying, though I hear there are some other drug options for non IR pcos\\'ers\\nI have had ovarian cysts since I was 15 (I\\'m 20 now) and been on bcp since then as well.  My doctor never did blood work, but said that I had it because i have certain symptoms. I have coarse hair on my arm and hands (which I shave cause it bugged me out), I have multiple cysts, and I have facial hair which I\\'m working on laser removal cause it too bugs me out!',\n",

       " {'post': 'Apologies in advance, I see there is already a thread very similar to mine started here, but I feel obligated to post my girlfriends problem word for word as she described it.  She is suspected to have PCOS, but she is VERY\\nneglectful of going to her doctor when she has a problem....  Before she started with a contraceptive (desogen) her periods were usually constant, but she doesnt show any excess hair.They have been thinking she may have PCOS for a couple of years now, but she hasnt gone in for enough testing to be conclusive, but at this stage in our lives, fertility is not a paramount issue (I am 19, she is 20)  However she experiences pain during sex.  Moisture doesnt seem to be an issue at\\n...  Her doctor has hinted that PCOS could be the cause, but after a lengthy web search, I can\\'t find any medical site that even makes a passing mention that PCOS caused issues with intercourse.  Her description is... \"it hurts going in. it burns and feels scratchy during sex. Afterwards it burns and its only inside of me,  i dont feel pain when u just rub me and play with me\"  She says it happens almost every time.  Very rarely does sex go without it.  The timeframe seems to go as such.  She feels a burning when I enter, but then everything is alright for 5-10 minutes, then she starts to feel some pain, which is where we stop.  Although on the few occasions where she...  *smacks the back of her head* didnt tell me she was hurting, the pain got excruciating very shortly.  When we stop at the start of pain she says the pain dies down in about an hour, and then it burns for about 30 minutes after.  If we dont stop she says the pain hangs around about an hour and a half, and the burn about an hour and a half after.  Sometimes she will be sore the next day too.  We are both very sexually natured people, and this is a major relationship issue for us, so we could use any help we can get...\\n\\nSo, now that Im down from my soapbox, I hope my longwinded description is enough.  We want to know if her pain is being caused by PCOS, or if her Dr. has us barking up the wrong tree...  and maybe where we could find the right tree.....\\n\\nThanks for reading.\\nJames & Becca\\nThis is just my personal thoughts, I\\'m no doctor though.  It sounds like she may have an internal yeast infection.  They can be very nasty, painful, burning, and sex just about is the most excruciating thing, the positive side of it is that it can be cured very easily with a prescription which means going to the doctor.  This happened to me once, went to my family doctor, he gave me a medication that I took for about a week and it was gone.  No problems since.  I know you said she hates the thought of going to the doctor but at least this isn\\'t going to the specialist and there really shouldn\\'t be any extensive testing to be done.  I HIGHLY recommend that she sees a doctor.  If this isn\\'t treated right away it will only get worse.  And you are right that there is no corrolation between this and PCOS as PCOS doesn\\'t cause that kind of problems, however having PCOS does make it easier for her to catch the yeast infection, rather than a normally health person.\\nHow long can a yeast infection go on?  This has been pushing a year now, and I would think that it would cause her discomfort all the time....  But then again, I\\'m no girl, and I dont have a clue what goes on down there.\\nyeast infection is a living infection, so as long as there is \"food\" down there it will survive.  As far as the pain down there being all the time, not true.  It\\'s kind of like a sore on your leg, it hurts when you first get it, but as long as you leave it alone, no pain.  You pick at the scab or touch the open wound it\\'s gonna hurt and it\\'ll take a while for the pain to go away.  As long as she has no inner disturbances it\\'s not going to hurt.  Now as I said I\\'m just taking a guess at this being the problem.  It could actually be a number of things.  Any kind of discomfort no matter what she is doing, is not a good thing.  If not treated whatever the problem may be, it\\'ll only keep getting worse.  But I don\\'t think it is from PCOS alone.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s no hug icon here, so you will have to deal with this cool, wavy grin....  I\\'ll be certain to let her know post-haste.  As a side, I\\'ve read in other places on HB that ovarian cysts can cause this sort of pain.  Different sort of cyst, or just not likely?\\n\\nThanks ALOT Dolphin27!\\ncyst will definitely cause that kind of pain as well.  It wouldn\\'t be ovarian cyst though cause well you wouldn\\'t be hitting them.  I\\'m not real familiar with cyst in the uterus area, so not much I can tell you on that line.  Definitely see the doc though.  Best of luck to you both!\\n',\n",

Maybe you\\'ld be more comfortable with a female physician if it makes you uneasy around a male doctor.\\n\\nA blood test should reveal your hormone levels and that can help to diagnose PCOS if that is, in fact, the problem.  Good luck!\\n\\nthere really isnt any one test. its a long list of symptoms and numbers that they look at to make an educated guess - and they still call it a syndrome b/c of that. many of the treatments are for other things and so its not like they would be un-safely overmedicating if they rx\\'d you and you happened not to have it. many women can have tons of the symptoms and not have pcos, or have few but have pcos etc\\n\\nanyway - i went to 4 doctors, they all had me undress but really it was just to check things i could tell them - where do i get hair, do i have issues with weight, periods, acne, oily skin, hair loss, etc etc . i guess u could explain where the symptoms are without them looking, but i think most want to do the examination. the woman dr actually (sorry for being graphic) looked and kind of felt around my clitoris because one sign of PCOS is an enlarged one! i woudl suggest getting a woman doc\\n\\nThey do a complete blood panel, thyroid, iron, proteins etc etc - plus testosterone, dhea/dheas, insulin resistance  /glucose tests, progesterone, estrogen, 17-hydroxy progesterone , and a few others some may or may not do. if you\\'re insured , I suggest getting them ALL done at once , i had them done over 4 doctors and it was a pain. also dont let them say \\' youre normal\\' bc the ranges are SO wide and even wome nwith seemingly normal levels can be sensistive to some androgens and need some meds.\\n\\nThe insulin resistance  / glucose tolerance is impt as is total testosterone and free testosterone / dheas.\\n\\nAlso they will have you get an ultrasound and a pelvic, vaginal - to see if you have cysts. But weirdly enough my endo said she woud have diagnosed me with just my symptoms (even tho i had the cysts)\\n\\nEven if you have moron doctors who brush you off you can get on birth control which may help, yasmin is usually the choice of pcosers with high androgent. sprio, metformin, there are others - just make SURE you get a dr familiar with this (endo / gyno combo is the best) and dont let them brush you off - most do\\nMy doctors just did blood tests and an abdominal ultrasound (I was a virgin so they were really trying to avoid pelvic exam and pelvic ultrasound).\\nI have PCOS and was diagnosed by blood and transvaginal ultrasound (internal).\\nits possible to have cysts and not have pcos, and have high or low tests and not have pcos, so just remember to look at the big picture. actually they say up to 40 percent of women with cysts dont have pcos !\\nthanks ladies\\nThe reason im so scared of gettin naked infront of one is cus i have  a *few* extra .....well okay about 150 extra lbs of weight n i dont let ANYONE see me naked. I know they\\'ve seen it all but every time I need to get weighed by someone, or take off some clothes, they send in some 90 lb person n make me feel that much more stupid...so perhaps I could request a fat female doctor? Oh well...maybe i\\'ll suck it up one of these days n go get tested\\nI\\'m sure its very very hard.  But try to psych yourself up and thing long term.  Good treatment might very well make your weight loss MUCH easier.  And you may be able to stay pretty covered up.  Both of my doctors had me keep my shirt on, pants off, but a big drape to cover myself with.\\na lot of times if you look through your insurance list of dr\\'s (assuming you have ins)\\n- i did that and found a chubby nice looking woman\\nI hear you about the weight, im 40 lbs overweight and i felt weird and ONE DR EVEN SAID , oh were BOTH overweight - ugh! I freaked out so much i lost 15 lbs and next time I went back I was so happy and they didnt even say anything\\n\\nI was recently diagnosed with PCOS. I had blood work, a pelvic exam, and both an internal and external ultrasound. ( thats also how I found out that my uterus is tilted backwards) I too have about 100 extra lbs but the pain hurt. I just always remember that they see serveral women a day and at the end they can\\'t remember how each of them looked. Plus if you have a good gyno it won\\'t matter. My gyno made me feel comfrotable. Plus extra weight is a symptom of PCOS and so they won\\'t be judging you based on extra lbs.\\nAlright...maaaaaybe i\\'ll go. I have another question though and this is gonna sound pretty stupid but uhm...How do they do a pelvic exam?\\n\\nGod this is making me nervous as hell. I have an appointment on the 23rd with an endocrinologist and on the 24th with my (new) gyno. I have never had a pelvic exam and being 19, I should of huh?? Well when I go in I will know if I have pcos.\\n\\nPelvic exams, when properly done, are basically painless.  If it hurts, it\\'s the doctor\\'s fault, and you should speak up.\\n\\nYou have to strip from the waist down and lay on your back on the table (with a paper drape over you so you don\\'t feel quite so cold).  (Most doctors have you strip completely and do a breast exam at the same time, but not all of them.)\\n\\nThey put up stirrups for your heels (knees bent) and have you scoot down so part of your rear hangs off the table.  (It makes it easier for them to see what they need to if the very end of your rear is hanging down instead of squished up against everything.)\\n\\nThe exam usually involves a quick inspection (for any odd marks on your skin, for example), a short \"look inside\" (they insert a warmed-up metal tube inside your vagina so they can see to the end of it), and a bimanual palpation.  This means she sticks one (gloved, of course) finger inside and puts the other hand on top of your stomach and presses down gently to see if she can find any lumps (inside or out).  If ANYTHING hurts, your job is to speak up!\\n\\nIf she does a Pap smear while she\\'s at it, then she\\'ll stick a swab up inside the metal tube and wipe at your cervix for a minute.  It\\'s no worse that getting a throat culture for strep -- just like a Q-tip inside you for three seconds.\\n\\nThe whole thing can take less than ten minutes, but if it\\'s your first time, you should tell the front desk to schedule a longer-than-usual appointment so your doctor will have plenty of time to tell you everything she\\'s doing.  (Some will even arrange a mirror so you can watch the whole thing.)\\n\\n\\nThere are probably lots of websites that have more details about pelvic exams if you do a search.\\ni have pcos\\ni had blood tests\\nultrasounds external and inturnal\\nthey suspected i had it from my symptoms\\n\\nbut didnt realy say until i had a laperoscopy (a camera through the belly button)\\n\\nthen metformin started then diabex\\ni am over weight as silly as it might sound i dont mind getting my gear of for the doc hehee\\n\\ni would also like to say i prefer male gyno\\'s and gp\\'s i had a female gyno who told me i was stupid for even thinking i was sick\\n\\nin my experience of two male gynos and i have seen them lots once a month for the past 14 years  they dont seem to assume on female things cause they are not one but the female gyno i went to compared me to her\\nI find you can have moron male OR female dr\\'s but when it concerns vaginal anything, usually its more comfortable w/ a woman doing the exam.

I am 31 and have wondered for years what is wrong with me...extra facial hair, adult acne, etc.  My question is...I've been getting these weird red marks on my back and my arms that only stay for a few days and are gone...but they come back again later in a different area.  He said he thought they were stretch marks and related to pcos.  But do stretch marks come and go?  And I'm not a heavy person...so would they be stretch marks?  He didn't get to see them because I didn't happen to have any yesterday.  And also...my veins show very much on my arms and my legs...could this be pcos/hormone related?  He didn't say....thanks!\\nI have PCOS and yes, you do have a lot of the symtpoms.  However, I have never heard of stretch marks or the red markings having anything to do with PCOS.  I don't think they sound like stretch marks anyway.  I have many stretch marks (thanks to my kids) and they never disappear.  I'm also not too sure about the veins either.  I have done extensive research on PCOS and that is something I haven't heard of being associated with it.\\nCheck out cushing's syndrome as a possibility.\\ni havent heard of those related either but since most women with pcos are overweight or yo yo diet , the extra weight often causes both stretch marks and veins. also check for anemia as that could be a factor.i started getting some dull pains in my left lower leg and light red marks in that area that look kind of like veins....its really weird. im going to a vascular surgeon next week. also women on birth control can get veins from that ......\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I have undiagnosed PCOS, but my doctor and other doctors I have seen are 100% sure I have it. I have been having blood sugar problems for a year or two now and have had a glucose test that came out fine. I have been testing my blood sugar lately since my mother got a machine after finding out she\\'s has Diabetes. I finally remembered to test it when I felt as if my blood sugar were low (tired, weak, light headed, burning cheeks, etc) and it said I was at 272! I\\'m going to see my doctor tomorrow. After an hour my sugar level had dropped to 100, which is a fast drop rate, from what my mother says (she\\'s an RN).\\n\\nA funny thing is, I got a psychological test when i was 12. They had no idea what was wrong with me. I had started puberty at 9, and started having periods at 10. This is also when i rapidly gained weight. They just stuck me on cylert and stopped at that. At 16 they finally realized I had PCOS (diagnosed, not yet tested) and put me on birth control. Only then did my moods stop. No kicking holes in doors, no screaming fits, no depression, no erratic periods, and basically i felt a lot better. I quit taking the cylert at 18 due to money issues and soon discovered I have ADD. I cannot focus well and my grades immediately dropped from A\\'s to B\\'s and C\\'s. So it\\'s quite stupid that my mother put out over $1,000 and they didn\\'t want to say \"oh it\\'s not mental, so it must be something else.\" I was a demon to my mother. Extremely moody and a short attention span\\n\\n\\nDoes anyone know of any diets that work well for PCOS? Any support groups? I don\\'t know much about it except that it causes body hair, weight gain, hormonal problems, and pregnancy issues. Thank you =)\\nMy daughter is 20 years old and was diagnosed a few months ago.  Her periods became farther and farther apart since about 16.  She started her period at 13, so she had 3 years of normal periods.  She has no glucose problems yet and no excessive hair.  She was diagnosed after having an internal ultrasound.  She is on Metformin and it has helped her have periods, but also has side affects for her.  She is a lot of nausea and fatigue.  I have heard that the South Beach Diet is excellent for PCOS.  There is some connection there with inflammation.  It\\'s interesting because today I was just reading  a medical article on inflammation and they listed all of the diseases that go along with it.  PCOS was one of them.  Anyway, the South Beach DIet is just an all around smart way to eat.  It helps with diabetes also.\\nA woman told me that many girls you can just look at them and tell they have it. A lot of their muscles are very firm, facial hair, etc. I have very firm calves and arms, but my upper arms and thighs are just fat. lol. Maybe it\\'s just because i\\'m either an hourglass or heart shape. You might talk to her doctor or a gynecologist about the side effects. My doctor changed me from Low Ovral to Yasmine and I had some weird symptoms at first but it\\'s regulated now. It\\'s amazing what kinds of things hormones can cause.\\n\\nMy doctor told me the 272 blood sugar reading was most likey a fluke, as this test they do that runs a blood sugar average over the past few months showed 80\\'s (normal). She says it\\'s all hormonal and asked me to watch my carb and sugar intake. For the ADD she is sending me to a Psychiatrist to get the medicine. And, I have an ear infection. My second one in a row. If i get another one I get to get tubes in my ears. fun.\\n\\nI hope your daughter feels better. Tell her Ibuprofen is the best thing for period pain, but to watch out for dosage instructions as if you don\\'t it can cause stomach irritation over time. Also avoid caffeine, drink lots of water, and watch out for carbs during your period,which is when the hormones are most erratic. I have my periods for 3 days, but i get a weeks worth of PMS and I also get a full week in 3 days. I\\'m just glad I\\'m not Diabetic.\\npcosers tend to carry weight around their waists like i do and i have been and will be on the pill forever (till menopause) to conrol period problems and keep cysts from growing larger. my sugar is hanging in around 100 so i havent had to take medication and i havent had any furry issues. my doctor wants me to walk several times a day for 15 to 20 minutes which is good exercise and helps prevent blood clots from the pills since i am over 35. theres no set diet except no white rice, bread or plain pasta. carbs are fine as long as they arent empty carbs. think fiber and whole grains. i now eat very little sugar and have increased fruits and veggies while meat portions have shrunk. its mostly common sense. i was told that if i excercise and eat sensibly i will slowly loose weight. the syndrome makes it difficult but not impossible. i miss golden oreos the most! dont give up. there are a lot of worse medical conditions out there and many things to help us feel better!\\nthanks.\\nMy mom is on the diabetic diet and i\\'m learning a lot from her. I didn\\'t realize carbs like rice, bread, and pasta metabolize into sugar. I also learned that fiber affects the carb amount in the food (like if it has 2 grams of fiber, and 10 carbs then you can say there is only 8 carbs). I love chinese food, so it\\'s hard. I\\'m also an avid meat lover, but i do love tofu and chicken breasts that that\\'s alright.\\n\\nLooking in her carb and fat counter i was amazed at the amounts in fast food. I did learn, though, that if you take the mayonnaise off the grilled chicken at McDonalds you remove almost 200 calories.\\n\\n\\nYea sense is good, but will power is too. I do gain weight around the center of my body. My arms (not upper) and calves are relatively thin but my calves are very muscular. I can\\'t do too much walking because the weight on my upper body (chest) puts too much pressure on my back. So I got an excersize bike and that is supposed to be good for me. I also am a BIG fan of Tybo. The Yasmine is doing good for me and I hope to eventually get laser to remove some of the facial hair.\\n\\nI think they should have more information out here on PCOS. I mean i never knew it existed!\\nIf PCOS is suspected in your case, which it does sound like you have it.......you should really see an endocrinologist or a Reproductive Endocrinologist.  Either one would be fine..........RE moreso if children are in your future.  Reason being........these specialists specialize in hormonal disorders/syndromes such as PCOS as well as an RE specializing in infertility.  With an RE, you can attempt to kill 2 birds with 1 stone.  Most regular doctors are not very familiar with PCOS.  They may know what it is, but they don\\'t always know the best treatment options for you.  If you do decide to be treated with meds, I can tell you that birth control only masks the problems of PCOS.  There are other meds out there (such as metformin) which can do wonders.  Metformin helps to regulate hormones, which can lead to more regular periods, weight loss, and even conception for those who suffer from infertility.\\n\\nAnother important thing with PCOS is diet and exercise.  Try to avoid carbs and high sugar intake.  Of course you need everything to balance your meals out, just do the carbs/sugars in moderation.  Fibers and proteins are great, especially if you have weight to lose.\\n\\nThe best thing for you to do would be to educate yourself about PCOS.  There are many great books out there, as well as many things on the internet.  Once you understand what is happening with your body, you will have a better understanding of what it is you need to control it.\\n\\nAlso, I understand that Diabetes has been ruled out, but have you been checked for Insulin Resistance?  Many women with PCOS have IR, which if left untreated can lead to Diabetes, and since your mother is a diabetic, that even makes your risk higher.\\n\\nIf you have anymore questions, just ask.  I was diagnosed with PCOS 5 years ago, and have researched it to death!!!',\n",

       " {'post': \"Then endo doctor my wife just saw told her that she should be prepared to never lose the weight she gained in pregnancy and in fact may look forward to a future of 400 calories a day just to maintain. In addtion to the PCOS she has a thyroid issue, not sure what, that is fighting against her. We've paid for a trainer in the past and all that happened was she firmed up, but she never lost one pound in the entire time she went religiously to the gym.\\n\\nRight now we are a bit of a mess in terms of health and it is taking a toll on both of us. I'm having severe thyroid issues leaving we exhausted and unable to go to the gym, she goes, but it frustrates her that she she's no results. We try to eat a very healthy diet low in sugars and starches, eat mostly healthy protiens, and  have good cholestoral levels.\\n\\nSorry, got off track.\\n\\nAnyway is this endo on the money about PCOS or should we seek a second OP?\\n\\nThanks.\\nI have a pretty bad case of PCOS.  In November of 2005......I wore a size 22.  I began walking and by April 2006.........I was down to a size 14!!!  Just by walking!!!  So, you can lose weight.  Having PCOS can make it harder to lose weight, but it can be done.  I joined a gym a few years ago and was working out everyday and noticed that I was not losing a pound.  I think the exercise was too rigorous or something.  Just simple walking did it for me!  I walked approx 5 miles per day (rain or shine).  Now, I wasn't just strolling.  I was doing some power walking........but that is what worked.\\nCongrats Barton on the weight loss.  I will certainly try that myself since I was not able to loose weight myself.\\n\\nddgryphon,\\n\\nI would seek a 2nd opinion.  I do not know if it is because of the thyroid but you should be able to lose weight.  I had gone to a nutrionist, which I need to do again and was put on a diet so to speak.  I lost weight easily.  I need to actually do that again.\\n\\nTerry\\nThank you both, I'll mention the walking. What drugs have they put you on. They've tried two different forms of metformin -- one a time release -- and both sit terribly with the wife's system (diarrhea, back pains, sick stomach). No wonder she gets frustrated talking to doctors -- everything they try to do semms to make her worse.\\nYeah well.  I've been told the same and I am freakin fed up w/the whole idea.  I have put myself on a Medifast Liquid diet--and that's just the way it's gonna be.  I was eating hardly anything by way of meals before--but probably a LITTLE more than I thought (like maybe 1000 cal a day instead of 600).  So, F*** it.  I'm just not going to eat anything solid until my jeans fit again.  THEN if my period doesn't come back--and I'm still having to remove a potential goatee every other day--back to the Doc's I'll go!!!\\n\\nMya\\ndd\\n\\nWhen I read your first message I felt like I was reading my own story.  Only I didn't have to end up at an endo doc to figure mine was pcos.\\nI too have a problem with my thyroid being under active which causes the metabolism to slow down and when matched with the pcos it just seems like a deadly combination.\\nBut then I read your second post about her having problems with the met I had all the same problems.  I went for a second opinion to a small town family doctor who seems to be very up to date on all the medications possible for everything.  He prescribed me Byetta, and while I wasn't too keen on the idea of doing a shot twice a day I figured what have I got to loose.  Now before you go freaking out about the shot thing, it's a very tiny needle you shoot it into the fatty areas of your body so you hardly feel a thing.\\nThe only trouble I had with the byetta was about a week after I started taking it it made me feel nauseas when I ate, well hello dummy me, byetta is designed to curb the appetite.  It scared me so I called the docs office they said it was normal, I adjusted my meal sizes and no problems since.\\nI have been on it for 6 months now, at my 3 month check up, my doctor rechecked my numbers everything looked good, now I'm a LAZY bum, I do not exercise never have and probably should, but at 3 months I had lost 22 pounds.\\nMy suggestion, talk to the endo doc about trying byetta or get a second opinion, what have you got to loose,  oh and on the bright side of byetta my doc informed me early next year they are hoping to come out with a once a week shot.\\nJust a thought and I hope I helped at least some!\\ndolphin:\\n\\nThank you, I will tell her to mention Beyetta and see if they think it could help.\\nBarton93,\\n\\nOk, now you have my attention.  I have gained about 20 pounds in 1.5 months.  I read your thread about going from a size 22 to a size 14 in such a short amount of time.  After I had my child I went from 230 to 190 without doing anything (in 2 weeks time).  I swore to myself I would keep it off.  I got up to about 210 and lost 40lbs.  Now I am up to 230 and gaining everyday.  I eat like a rabbit.  I live on a road that is 1 mile from my house to the gate.  If I do  the walk it is 2 miles.  My problem is that my right knee has had 4 surgeries and still pinches when I walk.  I have PCOS, but i don't want to blame it on that.  My Dr. put me on Yaz today and I hope that doesn't worsen the situation.....\\n\\nThanks for the inspiration.  I hope you will stay on this board to give me a little push once in a while.\\n\\n\\nHey Kayla.........thanks for the kind words.  I've been on these boards for a couple of years and will remain on these boards.  I have gotten some great advice and have been fortunate enough to give advice as well.  Don't give up.  Just stick with it.  PCOS does play a big role in all of this.  How long ago were you diagnosed?  Were you being treated before now?  PCOS wreaks havoc on our hormones and once you find a treatment option that works best for you, you will notice that your hormones settle down to a normal level.  Once you achieve that, it does make it easier to lose the weight.  You may still need to work harder than a non PCOS woman........but it can be done.  Hang in there..............we're all in the same boat here and we need each other to keep focused.\\nHi there I am new here...but I was diangosed with PCOS when I 14.. I am now almost 20. BUT back to your problem...I am on Metformin because I am insulin resistant (my body akes more insulin than needed and because of that My body rejects it and now I am borederline diabetic). I was a really hard time losing weight before I went on this medication, and ever since I went on it, I have been able to lose weight a lot easier. Of course as with anything losing weight, you need to eat right and excersise a little bit, but it helped me a lot with losing weight. I hope it helps. The Dr's also told met hat I wouldnt be able to lose weight and it took me going to a specialist to find this out. It is an expensive medication but a lot of insurances will cover this. Hope this will help you out!!!! Good luck and god bless! Miranda\\n\\nbabiesangel just reminded me of something that I left out.  Many women who have PCOS also have Insulin Resistance.  Many doctors only test for diabetes, which does not rule out IR.  IR if treated properly, can reduce your risk of developing Diabetes.  Also, IR also seems to be a huge factor in weight control.  Like I said before, if you can get control of your hormones, then you will see things start to stabilize, therefor making weight loss easier to achieve.\\n\\nMetformin is a great medication for many women.  For most women that try it, it does a wonderful job controlling the IR.  Metformin is a drug that is also used to treat Diabetes.  Another thing that Metformin seems to do is regulate our hormones.  Many women have seen wonderful results after using Metformin for a number of different things.  Some women see their periods become more regular, some women are able to successfully begin to lose weight and there are even women who become pregnant.\",\n",

Actually your DHEAS was pretty high.  The \"normal\" ranges for blood tests are a bell curve, which means the closer you get to low normal or high normal, there are much fewer people who have blood tests like you.  I hope that kind of makes sense\\nAnd I know I usually test the same way yours are.  One of my testosterone\\'s is high, and the other normal.  Not sure which is which.  But your % free testosterone is high.  You could ask your doctor about spironolactone for that.\\nVaniqa is also great for facial hair.\\n\\nwhy another hemoglobin A1c?  i\\'ll do a search on the c peptide.  thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\nat the time of this test, it was crap.  lots of highly refined carbs.\\n\\n\\n\\nmy doctor already wants me switching to a low GI/GL diet, and i\\'m going to meet with a dietician soon to help me switch (i\\'ve got some food allergies/intolerances, and foods i need to avoid with my thyroid, so i need some help meal planning.).\\n\\n\\n\\ni fired my endo because not only was she not concered about my thyroid symptoms, or my hemoglobin A1c, but she couldn\\'t give a crap about my wacky testoserone.  my new doctor seems much better.\\n\\nis there a chance this could be PCOS?  how do they know?  what can be done to treat it without drugs?\\n\\nrachel.\\n\\nWell, one indication of PCOS is an uneven ratio between these two hormones. Yours is slight, but still very much an indication. It sounds like your tests were also given on the correct day of the cycle, so the tests should be accurate (correct me if i\\'m wrong, but i THINK the follicular phase includes the actual bleeding part of the period, so that would be the phase you\\'re in).\\n\\nvery interesting.  thanks for the information.  i think you are right, that i was in the follicular phase.  i will be sure to take this information to my doctor when i go to see him again in february.\\n\\nis there a cure for PCOS, or is there only treatment of symptoms?\\n\\nright now, i want to get my thyroid hormones right, eat a better diet (that is also lower glycemic index/load), get to the point where i am feeling good enough to exercise regularly, and lose weight.  from the little bit i know about PCOS, all of these things would be good for it.  are the only treatments drugs to treat the symptoms, because i\\'d really rather avoid that if i could...\\n\\nthank you all so much for your replies.\\n\\nrachel.\\nQuestion\\nIf you are on the BC Pill, does that affect the hormone level testings??  I am assuming that if you have your hormone levels tested, and on the pill since the pill IS hormones, that would not give you a actual true reading\\nYes being on the pill affects hormone tests.

But they most likely won't even want or need to do an exam.  Blood tests will tell them a lot.  And while transvaginal ultrasounds are more helpful, my doc opted for the abdominal ultrasound when I was a virgin.  While he could see enough to where he didn't feel the need to try transvaginal, he showed it to me.  It is much less invasive than an exam.\\nIf the doc thinks they need an exam, there are some great pediatric gyn's out there.  My sister had to go to one and had a very comfortable experience.  They have tiny instruments and are used to treating very young girls.  I would talk to their regular doctor and see what s/he suggests.\\ndo they have other symptoms? I wouldnt see a pediatric gyn for the 15 yr old, if she has her period I think of her as an adult\\nAn endocrinologist will know the right tests for them, I suggest a woman and someone a bit younger as the ones 55+ dont always know much about PCOS.\\n\\nMy sister and I both have PCOS - she was RX at 29 and myself at 26, but signs were there around 17-18.\\nYour 15yr old daughter sounds like me (I was diagnosed at age 18 eairler this year)I could go all the way to 6months without a period but most of the time I skiped 3 or 4 months. I always had bad cramps and alot of weight gain but I also started growing facial hair. You don't have to take them to a gyno lots of people have been diagnosed through a family physican. Although I personaly beleive the sooner it is diagnosed the better it is so you can make certian changes in your life (such as diet, exersice   ect) which might be harder the older you get. Good luck and it is my sincerist hope that they don't have PCOS.\\ni have been reading on pcos and they have a few  symptoms .1 that i forgot to say was Anxiety& Panic they both been put on med for it around the time they both started getting their peroids.it worries me that my 12 year old bleeds so much every month and that my 15 year old is having hers so far apart and now shes starting to get cramps so bad for 1st 2 days that she just stays in the bed.can any1 tell me how they test some1 thier age because they both are fighting me on seeing a doc for it because they dont want an exam done.Thanks\\n\\n\\nThey don't always do a pelvic exam. If you take them to a family physician they will probably just do blood work.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I\\'m a 25 year old female who\\'s concerned that I might have PCOS.  My periods have always been extremely irregular, often skipping 3 or 4 months at a time.  Also, I have an abnormal amount of hair on my chin and chest.  What bothers me the most is my weight gain.  I\\'m only 5 feet tall and just a few years ago, I was only 95 pounds.  Now, I weight 128 with most of my weight centered around my stomach.  This has caused me a great deal of insecurity as I am always trying to find ways to cover my stomach.  Lately, I\\'ve been dieting and exercising, but it doesn\\'t seem to be helping a great deal.  I\\'m at the point where I\\'m even considering liposuction.\\n\\nI would love to go see a doctor and possibly get diagnosed but at the time I don\\'t have any health insurance.  I\\'ve considered going and just paying the costs out of pocket, but I believe it\\'s probably out of my budget.  Also, during research, I\\'ve read that the best way to get diagnosed is to see an andocrinologist.  Is a referral necessary, or can you just make an appointment?\\n\\nI know irregular periods are a symptom of PCOS but does that also include the lenghth of periods?  My period has been on for about three weeks and that also concerns me.  Last month, my cycle lasted for two weeks, and before then, I didn\\'t have one for 3 1/2 months.  Could this also be attributed to PCOS?\\n\\nSorry this post is so long but I have a lot of my mind and I really don\\'t know what to do.  If anyone that has PCOS or knows a great deal about it could offer me some advice, or just give me general info, I\\'d greatly appreciate it.\\nYes, it does sound like PCOS may be a possibility.  I have PCOS and I have all of the same symptoms as you have.  However, the duration of my periods never changed.  They were always about 7-8 days long.\\n\\nAn Endocrinologist is your best bet because they specialize in hormonal disorders.  The only time a referral is really necessary when seeing on is if you have an insurance policy that requires them for specialists.  If you don\\'t have insurance, then you shouldn\\'t need one.\\n\\nI was diagnosed 4 years ago and have done extensive research on PCOS and can pretty much answer any question you may have..........so if you want to know anything else, just ask.\\nIt sounds like you may be HYPOTHYROID...this can cause all the symptoms you have too...the long periods and weight gain. I agree. You need to see a good endocrinologist and a good gynocologist....\\nHi.  I\\'m sorry I don\\'t have a response to your question, but I have another question for all the people who know about PCOS.  Let\\'s say someone may have PCOS....   If you go a long time without being diagnosed can that cause a lot of damage?  My doctor said it was a possibility that I could have it but all she did was put me on Birth Control and that was it.  But... yes I have almost the same thing as you jnette97.  I\\'m 4\\' 11\\' and I\\'ve recently been gaining a lot of weight.. I\\'m up to 118 which is a little big for me, though it may be because I\\'m on BC. I don\\'t know...  I have acne... My periods are irregular and usually last about a week, but the most was 3 weeks.   I was just wondering if left untreated could it cause a lot of damage?  Sorry I couldn\\'t help jnette97.  Hope you feel better.\\nI think PCOS is overdiagnosed. You ladies don\\'t sound like classic cases to me. A little bit of weight gain does not signal a problem. People with PCOS are generally VERY overweight. PCOS is most likely caused by insulin resistance to begin with. You may want to have an ultrasound done to check though.\\n\\nThat is incorrect.  Not every PCOS woman is VERY overweight.  In fact, most are simply overweight!  As a matter of fact, there are many PCOS women who do NOT have a weight problem.  A weight problem is only 1 of the symptoms.  You do NOT have to have every symptom to possibly have PCOS.  Also, there is no known cause for PCOS!  There is no proof of PCOS being caused by insulin resistance.  There is no proof of insulin resistance causing PCOS.  Not every PCOS woman has insulin resistance.  So, to say that it is most likely caused by insulin resistance is inaccurate.  The only way to know for sure is so see a specialist, have a complete blood work up done and an ultrasound.\\n\\nI can tell you of my experience and hopefully you\\'ll get a better picture of what is going on with me.  I was diagnosed with PCOS after many years (about 6) of not getting a period at all!  My endometrial lining was literally like kryptonite and was 4 times the thickness it should have been.......doc said that was a rest haven for cancer.  That is one of the reasons why birth control is prescribed, so it forces your body to have a cycle each month to avoid something like that.  I also had elevated cholesterol, and I am a diabetic.  Having PCOS puts you in a higher risk category of developing heart disease, ovarian cancer, diabetes, as well as some other things.  So, to answer your question...........yes, if PCOS is NOT treated, it can possibly lead to more problems.\\n\\nAlso, many doctors will prescribe BCP for PCOS.  You really need to be diagnosed by an Endocrinologist.  They specialize in hormonal disorders and can give you an effective treatment plan.  The problem with BCP is that they mask the problem.  They do nothing whatsoever to treat the problem, except for cause you to menstruate.  Being on something else, such as metformin or spironolactone in conjunction with the BCP helps to regulate all of the unbalanced hormones...........which can successfully result in weight loss, conception (if experiencing infertility) among other things.  So, it is very important to treat PCOS with diet, exercise and the medications.\\n\\nIt defenitly sounds like a good possiblity that you might have PCOS. I was diagnosed by my gynocologist. Although it might be pretty expensive if you try to pay the money out of pocket because I went thru 2 ultrasounds, a pelvic exam, and blood tests before I was diagnosed. Although its defenitly something that needs to be checked out. I hear alot about health clinics maybe they could check things out for you. Good luck with everything!\\nI am sorry if I offended anyone. When I stopped taking BCP\\'s I never got my period  back (it had been 5 or 6 months). I went to an OB/GYN at the university I was attending and she said I very well could have had PCOS. My hormone workup was normal - no insulin resistance, etc (aside from a high normal total testosterone of 67, and an LH of 8.8, FSH of 3.0- taken at some random point in the cycle). I had no hirsutism, was 124 pounds 5\\'4\\'\\', etc. She did not give me an ultrasound or recommend one. She scared me horribly. I wanted to get pregnant so bad and she said \"here\\'s a prescription for provera, induce a period every few months, you don\\'t really want a baby anyway this young.\" I went and got a second opinion from the OB/GYN who was my OB. Yes OB b/c I WAS PREGNANT! It just took several months to begin ovulating again after stopping the pill. Before diagnosing the pregnancy, she said I definately did not have PCOS. The nurse prac told me that insulin resistance was the cause of PCOS and I did not have it. After reading several journal articles on new research I tend to agree. When I had an ultrasound to date the pregnancy, my OB showed me my ovaries and said \"look, they are normal.\"\\n\\nIn conclusion, my experience has led me to believe that this disorder is overdiagnosed. Perhaps I just didn\\'t have a good doctor to begin with. Again, I am sorry if I offended anyone.',\n",

Glucophage is used to affect your insulin so it is used correctly in the body.  It also disables some sugars from digesting in the intestine.  I read that many people with PCOS have higher insulin levels and testosterone, which apparently can affect ovulation and pregnancy.  So, together, they SHOULD  increase your chances.  Yes, I've been on Clomid, but since I now mysteriously ovulate on my own, I don't need it.  For me, it did make me ovulate.\\nHopefully, it'll do the same for you!!!\\n\\nGlucophage has given me occasionaly diarreah and stomach cramping.   I don't know how you'll react to it, though!

I was on depo for 1 year and half and just finished my 12th week on March 16th. I started spotting on the 10th of this month and actually started my period on the 21st. It lasted about 5 days. I read that some the sytoms of PCOS is missed periods and hair loss. During the time I was taking depo, my period stopped and I started to have hair loss. I think i\\'m just reading too much info and getting myself scraced about PCOS. Before the whole depo thing I was on the pill with no problems and before that my periods were regular but I was on a 21 day cycle instead of a 28 day. If anyone has any info let me know. Thanks.\\nI have no idea, have you found anything since online?  I was on depo for 11 years and didn\\'t have a period and didn\\'t have hair loss.  Let us know what you find out!\\nHow about if you are on Depo and received a period , and it\\'s lasted 13 days so far? is this normal? this is my first injection....\\nHi,\\n\\nIt\\'s normal that your period will go wacky for some time when you first start depo. Mine was normal before depo and started to get lighter within a couple of months and then stopped competly by the 6th month. I had my last shot in Dec. and after the 12th week I got my period for about 5 days. Each woman acts differntly to depo. My sister-inlaw was heavy bleeding for the whole 3 months of the first shot . Let us know if anything changes for u.\\nWith both pcos and depo your estrogen can be low, causing the symptoms you are describing.  I\\'m not saying there isn\\'t a link, just that it is possible your symptoms are from depo alone.\\nI began Depo after having a child and stayed on it for 2 years.  Prior to Depo, I had never had an irregular period.  I was like clockwork each and every month!  During Depo, my periods completely stopped, I lost hair, gained hair in other places, gained weight.  After Depo......I experienced secondary infertility.  It took me 2 years to get pregnant!  The only reason I got pregnant was because I had to go on Clomid to force my periods each month because up until that point, my period had not returned!!!  After having my 2nd child.......my period still never returned.  5 years after my last Depo injection, I finally had my first non-induced period!!!  The only time my period was induced was during the 4 months I was on Clomid.  Now, I\\'ve been off of the shot for over 8 years, and my periods are still crazy.  I only get a handful a year.  Oh, and back in 2000, I was diagnosed with PCOS!!!  PCOS usually manifests itself at the onset of puberty...........not well into your 20\\'s!!!  I believe that Depo DID cause my PCOS!  Many women have wonderful experiences.......I on the other hand, did not.  I often wonder if I would be in the same boat had I never used Depo.  IMO....I don\\'t think I would be because I had never had any of these problems prior to Depo, then after Depo............BAM, every problem imaginable!\\nHi Barton 93,\\n\\nI feel your pain. I never had any problems before depo and since I started taking  it I feel like my life is in ruins. I just came off depo a few weeks ago and had a period already, so I think that a good sign. I\\'m just worried that I could have more problems later. From what I have been able to find out on Depo, is that some women still have a lot of health problems down the lane. I just can\\'t beilve that a company can make a med with nothing to reverse it. you mentioned that you had hair loss, did it take long to grow back? I just hope if anyone decides to use depo that they really look into first. Like most women that I spoke with and emailed with they all say the same thing, Doctors told them the only side effects are weight and change or no periods and that once they stop the shots everything will go back to normal. For some it\\'s a great choice and for others it\\'s horrible. Thanks for your input.\\n\\nYes, it is a good sign that your period has already returned.  Just make sure it continues to come each month.  If you notice that it is irregular, I suggest you see your doctor to address it.\\n\\nI lost a lot of hair from using Depo.  I used to have beautiful thick curly long hair.  Now, my hair is pretty thin.  I have to wrap a scrunchy around my pony tail 3 times to keep it from falling out!  That is how much hair I have lost!  The hair that I have lost doesn\\'t seem to be coming back, but I don\\'t seem to be losing it as fast now.  I still lose more than what I think is normal, but it has definately slowed down.\\n\\n\\nHi everyone,\\n\\nI would like to say thank you for all your input on this. I never heard of PCOS before until I started looking into the side effects of Depo-provera. I can\\'t really tell if my systoms are from PCOS or from Depo or just normal things. I have always had a problem with my weight, but I did manage to lose 50 pounds last fall and keep it off while on Depo. I have no acne. The only really bad side effect that I have is the hair loss. It seemed that my hair would fall out more faster after having a shot and it has since slowed down a few weeks ago since the end of the last shot. I\\'m soo confused! I will be seeing my doctor tomorrow and let her know what\\'s been going on. Is there a test to see if you have PCOS? I\\'ll let you know how the doctor visit goes. I\\'m hoping this Depo nightmare will soon be over.\\n\\nThere is no actual \"PCOS\" test.  The only thing they really can do is check different hormone levels and ultrasound.',\n",

Gah.\\n\\nthanks for any help =)\\nabc760,\\nHave you had your blood tests done at the Drs.for sugar,& thyroid etc. It sure sounds like your blood sugar is taking a dive down.That can cause you to have the shakes,and not feel well at all.\\nI\\'m on Atkin\\'s diet, and I know for the first few days on the 2 week induction diet you don\\'t feel good at all with not having all the sugar & caffine.\\nYou could ask your Dr.what she,or he recommends for a diet for you.\\nLots Of Luck! I hope you feel better fast!! sjg\\n\\n\\nHi!\\n\\nI was Diagnosed with PCOS when I was 16 (I\\'m now 25) and its been so long since I\\'ve really thought about it... I learned some interesting info from your post, thanks!\\n\\nI\\'d say that if you can\\'t cut carbs out, try to eat whole grains -- brown rice, wheat bread, more fiber. I\\'ve been on atkins for 5 days, and I was hungry for the first two days. Try to carry around cheese with you, string cheese is great. Or maybe check into a low carb bar that you could throw into a purse or backpack.\\n\\nAnyway, good luck!\\nHi abc760,\\nI don\\'t know if you will still read this after 2 months.  I hope you\\'re doing better now.  I just wanted to share a little of my knowledge and experience.\\nFirst of all, information is a very GOOD thing.  I recommend you read all you can about PCOS, diet, exercise, medication, symptoms, etc.  That is what helped me the most.\\n\\nI just want to mention two things about your hunger.  First of all, increasing your exercise will increase your hunger.  Try eating more protein because that fills you up.  Try to stay away from simple carbs (white bread,  white pasta, etc).  If you need the extra energy for strenous exercise, eat small amounts of whole wheat products.  Some recommend leaving cereal out of your diet, but there are many whole wheat cereals out there which also are fairly high in proteins.  This may be an option for you.\\n\\nAlso, you mentioned that three months ago (about 5 now) you started taking hormones.  This can also change your appetite.  Birth control pills, as far as I know, cannot actually make you gain weight.  What they do is increase your cravings and appetite.  This is why exercise and diet regulation is so important.\\n\\nAs for your non-existent metabolism, weight training can help a lot with this.  Start with low weights and increased reps.  Any gym with a trainer can give you a routine.\\n\\nDrink lots of water.  This helps a lot with hunger and with skin problems.\\n\\nHope this helps!  I know, it\\'s an on-going battle.\\nHang in there!\\nThis is weird because I think I might have PCOS can you guys tell me about your symptoms\\n[[waves merrily]] Hello. I am abc760 so I am still around.\\n\\nPCOS is basically just an insulin imbalance, where the pancreas produces too much insulin. However the side effects of PCOS causes alot of hormonal imbalances as well. Symptoms of PCOS is as follows:\\n\\n- irregular periods: abnormal, irregular, heavy or scanty (oligomenorrhea)\\n- absent periods (amenorrhea)\\n- ovarian cysts\\n- hirsutism (excess facial and/or body hair)\\n- alopecia (male-pattern hair loss)\\n- obesity\\n- acne\\n- skin tags\\n- acanthosis nigricans (brown skin patches, often found on the nape of the neck)\\n- high cholesterol levels\\n- high blood pressure\\n- exhaustion and/or lack of mental alertness\\n- decreased sex drive\\n- excess \"male\" hormones, such as androgens, DHEAS, or testosterone\\n- infertility\\n- decreased breast size\\n- enlarged clitoris(rare)\\n- enlarged ovaries\\n- enlarged uterus\\n\\nPCOS effects 5-10% of all women. It is the leading cause of infertility in women.\\n\\nIf you think you have PCOS: Go straight to an endocrinologist. They specialize in glandular disorders; in this case, the gland in question is the pancreas, which is overproducing insulin. Seeing an OB/GYN is only really useful if you are trying to get pregnant and, even then, a reproductive endocrinologist would probably be better informed.\\n\\nThe best way to maintain PCOS is actually through diet and exercise. A diet focused on low carbs and healthy foods, and steady amount of exercise, is your best bet to decrease the side effects of PCOS.\\n\\nPCOS is a disease, and unfortunately, your are already at a risk for diabetes and heart disease. Too stay healthy, one HAS to keep a healthy weight.\\n\\nAll information was found on different websites as I am so lazy I rather copy and paste then actually type it all out =). I would post them but it is not allowed.\\n\\nThank you for the replies =). I have converted to healthier eating and haven\\'t been around processed foods for awhile. That worked well for awhile and I got down to 140, but unfortunately I fell into stress and depressed (home-sickness\\n)  related eating, though now even though the stress/depression is gone, I am still\\npoorly diet/exercise wise due to finals...I have no time whatsoever. I think I \\'ve been having pizza 24/7 for the past 4 weeks\\n. And been getting around 4-5 hrs of sleep per night O_o. Ah college life.\\n\\nIf you want anymore information about PCOS, be free to ask.\\n\\n~sillynilly~',\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi,\\n\\nMy doctor said I'm borderline PCOS today and that I need to try to drop some weight and eat healthier. Problem is, when I don't eat for a few hours, I get shaky and weak and sweaty because my blood sugar dips. I'm a college student, so its hard to avoid carbs entirely-a lot of what is served is carbs. But I need to start and I plan to try. I was wondering if anyone else with PCOS could share their experiences with me..and does losing weight really help? Thanks.\\nHi Julie!!!\\n\\nI was diagnosed with PCOS at the age of 16.  Weight problems are one of the nasty symtoms of this disease!!!! I have a severe case of PCOS and I have found that when I lose weight, if I am not careful, the weight will come right back.\\n\\nYou might want to start with an exercise program.  I found a cardio & aerobic exercise program helps me!! As far as a diet, I do not limit\\nI eat, I limit\\nI eat.  Try eating small meals all through the day.  My Dr. told me to eat 6 small meals a day.  When I told him there was no way I could eat that much, he said that I did not have to eat a complete meal, just munch on something that is healthy and no candy bars!!!\\nSo I became a grazer.  I find myself eating healthy snacks all through my day.  The Atkins kind of diet is not recommended for women with PCOS.  Some websites promote the Atkins diet for us, but my Dr. frowns on it and from experience, it only made me feel sick!!!!\\n\\nOnce you start loosing weight and exercising, you will find that you will feel much better!! Do some research on PCOS and I am sure you will get some questions that you may have answered.  PCOS is a pain in the butt, but is managable!!! You are lucky because your case is not as severe as some!!!\\n\\nIf you need any help, ask away!!!!\\n\\n\\nGOOD LUCK!\\nThanks for the quick reply!\\n\\nDo you also have the problem where your blood sugar drops severely when you don't eat for awhile? If I have breakfast at 8 am, by 10:30 I'm a shaky, sweaty, weak mess and thats when I'll dive into the carbs. Right now I'm thinking I'll just eat better-as in cut out burgers/fries/sweets and incorporate more lean meat and fruits and veggies. Do you think that will help, even if I don't cut out all carbs, such as having bread with a sandwich? Its so hard in college, the food revolves around sandwiches.\\n\\nAlso, did you ever have to go on birth control? They suggested ortho tri cyclen for me if things don't get better with weight loss. My skin isn't so great right now either, I'm having troubles with breakouts and I know that could be related to pcos. Have you had that trouble as well??\\n\\nThanks for reading, look forward to seeing your reponse!\\nI was diagnosed with PCOS and have been reading quite a bit of information on it.  Weight problems are the worst thing about this disease.  My DR also wanted to put me on birth control but I didn't take them after reading other message boards that women with this condition only gained more weight on the BCP.  So I've been working out and trying to watch what I eat and the weight is coming off slooooowly.  I mean slowly.  I read that high protein diets are the best for women with PCOS but how many people can really tolerate those for long??  I think eating small meals throughout the day is just what I need, I am going to try that, before I was starving myself and eating one big meal a day.  The trainer I work out with says thats a big NO NO.  Especially since I also suffer from hypothyroidism.  Good Luck finding what works best for you, research the internet you may find some thing helpful  out there.\\n[[waves]] hey there fellow PCOSers\\n\\nAll that I know is what I learned through websites and books...however, PCOS is still a shady topic...doctors really don't know alot about it and not a whole lot of research is done on it...i have read alot of contradicting things, so I just follow what seems the most practical...one problem with PCOS is that most women do not know that they have it...the side effects of PCOS are treated, but rarely is the root of the problem (PCOS) is found =\\\\\\n\\nOne thing, don't go on birth control pills...even when i was on the lowage dosage available, it about killed me...this is from my own personal experience, but really, the birth control pills on control a\\nof PCOS...the best way to control PCOS is through a healthy diet and exercise\\n\\nPCOS is often thought as a hormonal imbalance, which is why when you go to the OBGYN they often refer you to birth control pills...the truth is PCOS is caused by an insulin problem...your pancreas creates\\nmuch insulin...in an aspect, you are the opposite of a diabetic...this causes your body to not process sugars correctly, causing sugar blood drops and being hungry all the time, and thus the weight gain as well\\n\\nAtkins diet is found to work the best for weight loss in PCOS women as it stabalizes their blood sugar...since it is stabalize, you see the side effects of PCOS disappear or get less severe as well...however I agree that atkins is not the healthiest choice for someone with PCOS...atkins might stabalize your blood sugar but it also depresses it, which is why some people who go on Atkins feel drain, weak, and shaky after being on it for more then a week or two\\n\\nWhat I did which is working for me: I went on a high protein/low carb diet for about 2 weeks...this allowed the body to be cleaned out and it stabalizes the insulin levels...then start with a healthy eating style, mimicking that of the diabetic...eat fruits, veggies, and whole grains, lean meats, and stay away from sugary foods...they totally wreck your insulin levels...i am in college as well, and i agree that to eat healthy, the food becomes extremely monotonous (i am afraid i can never look at a salad the same way again), but i tell myself that i have a disease, and i need to take care of myself in order to live a long and healthy life...the weight gain aggravates PCOS, and many women do become diabetic later in life if they don't take care of it, and also suffer from a truckload of side effects, including infertility, and bad skin...this is a disease, and you need to take care of yourself as best as you can...if you simply can't find any food that you think is healthy at the school caf, talk to the cafeteria and explain to them that you need a healthy lifestyle...many schools offer diabetic meals...i agree with the other that you should have 5-6 mini meals a day...last and not least, exercise! it really does help...do cardio and weight training, and drink alot of water...take vitamins and minerals...try to beat the root PCOS and not just the symptoms\\n\\ni hope this helps, and there is alot that you can research out there as well...as i said, this is what makes sense to me after reading through a bunch of contradicting material :P\\n\\n~sillynilly~\\nHi Julie!!!\\n\\nI did feel like you did when I did not eat, but when I started eating small snacks all though my day, I stopped feeling like that!!! Try to limit your carbs and go with fruit, veggies or those oatmeal bars!!\\n\\nYes, I was on birth control pills to bring on my period because I never had a natural period without\\nor\\n.  Dr.s go with birth control pills most of the time because of the hormones.  This is a personal choice because there are side effects of both the birth control pill and provera.\\n\\nOrtho tri cyclen is supposed to help with your skin problems.  I do not know if it will work because I never have taken the ortho.  Instead, I am using Pro Active Solution and have been for 5 years.  Pro Active really helps me, but depending on your skin, I can not promise it will work you you.\\n\\nOnce you start an exercise program, you should loose weight.  It is known that fat holds estrogen and once you start loosing fat, the estrogen that is trapped will be released and you will start feeling different and you will see a difference in your skin!!!!  Try loosing weight before going on any medications.\\n\\nThere is a medication called Metformin, which is given to diabetics, but has shown great promise in women with PCOS.  This medicine helps with your insulin, which can be a problem with some women with PCOS.  I took this medication for a while because I was trying to get pregnant.  The one thing I noticed while taking this is that my skin looked better, my cravings for sweets went away and the hair on my legs grew slower!!! In some women, Metformin even helped regulate their periods.  You might want to look into this medication if diet and exercise does not help and before going to hormones!!!\\n\\nIf you do not have your period on an regular basis:   Do not wait more than 3 months to have your period because you can get hyperdisplasia of the uterus.  That means that the lining of your uterus gets really thick and can cause cancer if not watched!!! This is one of the problems I have!!! I have to go in for endometrial biopsies on a regular basis and let me tell you, they are no fun at all!!! I no longer take birth control pills, instead I am taking provera, which will bring on a period, every three months.  Again, this is up to you and your Dr. to decide what route you should go.  Since you are boarderline, you may not even have a problem with your periods and that is one thing to be happy about!!!!\\n\\nPCOS affects each woman differently. You need to get as informed as you can and ask your Dr. many questions.  Yes, there are some Dr.s who know little about PCOS, but there are Dr.s that know a lot.  I am lucky, my Dr. was very informed and has really helped me and I have been living with this for over 20 years!!!\\n\\nHope this helps!!! Good Luck!!\\n\\nHi...I'm new here. I have had PCOS since 1999, but was not told about it until about a year ago. My husband & I have been trying to have a child for about 4 years now and it has been a really bad emotional battle (espically on my end).\\n\\nI had been on\\nfor about 2 weeks, but the gas problems were so bad ... any suggestions. I'm currently on\\ndays 25-30 to start my period. I will not go back on birth control at all.\\n\\nI also did the Atkins diet for 3 months, but was so weak and barely lost any weight. Atkins made me sick too, it's just so unhealthy. I'm currently trying a low carb/ low fat verizon of Weight Watchers and so far I'm down 10 lbs in the last month.\\n\\nAny suggestions will be very helpful. I have only learned about my condition online also & lots of endlist nights of staying up and reading site after site. My new GYN has been very helpful and seems to know quit abit.\\n\\nTiggergirl98\\nHi Tigergirl!!\\n\\nKeep taking your Metformin!! Those nasty side effects\\nwill go away within a couple more weeks!!!! I know it can be a pain in the butt, but Metformin is worth a try, especially since you are trying to get pregnant!!!!\\n\\nUnfortunately, Provera is the only thing you can take that will bring on your period and taking birth control pills is not an option since you are trying to get pregnant!!!!  Maybe you will be one of the lucky ones and the Metformin will regulate your periods!! It will take a while for the Metformin to work its magic.\\n\\nOnce you are on the Metformin for awhile, Clomid might be helpful to try and get pregnant.  The Metformin/Clomid combo does work with some women with PCOS, but it depends on how severe your PCOS is.  Unfortunately, I have tried everything and I never did become pregnant.  One of the reasons is that my PCOS is considered severe and also I am over the age of 35, which makes it even harder.  So, the younger you are, the best chance you have that the Metformin/Clomid combo will possibly work for you!!!\\n\\nYou are on the right track on your weight loss and you should be proud of yourself.  Having PCOS makes it hard to loose weight and keep it off!!! Once you get to your goal weight, maintaining the weight loss will be very important and you will have to work harder to keep the weight off!!!!  Are you on an exercise plan?  If not, I suggest that you start one!!!! I find a good cardio/aerobic plan helps me!!!! The excercise along with the diet will get you to your weight loss goal faster and you will feel better!!!!\\n\\nI am glad that you are getting informed about PCOS!!! This disease is not fun, especially when you are trying to get pregnant!!! My advice is to listen to your Dr. and follow what he/she says!!! The more informed your Dr. is the better it is for you!!!!\\n\\nTry to not worry so much because stress makes it even harder!!!! Believe me, I understand 100% how you feel about trying to get pregnant and struggling with your feelings!!!! I have spent many a days crying about not being able to have a child.  It has taken me years to finally come to terms with it!!! I don't know how old you are, but I will tell you that you have a very good chance in becoming pregnant if you are younger than 35,  just follow your Dr.'s plan for you!!!! If you are in my age group (35+) then I would tell you to keep trying until you feel you can not try anymore!!! I finally had to give up after spending thousands of dollars and getting tired of feeling depressed all of the time!!!!  With GOD's help, I was able to stop trying and go on with my life!!! I know that it can be overwhelming, just keep a positive attitude!!!!\\n\\nGood Luck, my prayers are with you!!!\\n\\nThank you Steelwife! What you have told me has been a great inspiration. I will continue with the metformin and my doctor does what me back on Clomid (round 2 for me). Maybe the combo will work.\\n\\nBy the way...I'm 23 (24 in March).\\nHi again Tiggergirl!!!\\n\\nJust keep doing what you are doing regarding the Clomid.  Don't loose hope because the Clomid can be upped, so if it does not work the first time, you still have the chance to go again, with a larger dose!!!  You are young enough for good things to happen!!!!!!\\n\\nI'll keep you in my prayers honey and pray that you will be blessed soon!!!!\\n\\nI was diagnosed with pcos two months ago. But the doc was so non-chalant about it, and waved it off like it was no big deal. Also, because there is no exact testing for PCOS, nor an explanation for it....it is often misdiagnosed. Fact is the symptoms of Extreem Weight Gain are alot like those of PCOS. Your body can be thrown completely out of whack, because it is not made to handle the weight. Especially with short females. Hormones are the first to be thrown for a loop with massive weight gain. I believe I have an under active thyroid due to the weight and poor life style and eating habits I adobted over the last 3 years. But I don't believe I have PCOS. My symptoms are of those that show I have High Testosterone levels. Something that only happened 3 years ago, when I started gaining weight. 110 lbs to 180lbs in 2 years! That's when all these symtoms started. I know I didn't just wake up with PCOS. But I do know I had a big lifestyle change and suffered from depression after a loss in my life. Down hill from there. Don't think about PCOS, forget about that!!!!!!! Just adopt a healthier way of life, and you'll find you'll go back to the way you were before this pcos mess was ever brought up. - Jaded\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi everyone, I have a severe case of acne caused by PCOS, I’ve taken the drug Tetracyclin, however, once I take the last pill about a week goes by and they re appear. I’ve also taken the famous Accutane, and just depressed me. Not only are they big, red, and ugly but they are more like tumors. I try to poke them with a needle every now and then and that nasty, smelly white stuff comes out. But they keep coming back. Is there anything else I can do to help my problem. By the way, these things are soooo painful that I can’t even sleep at night most of the time I don’t want anything to come close to my face. PLEASE HELP ME FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS PAIN. THANK YOU.\\n\\nFirst of all, I sympathize with you. I have dealt with cystic acne for years (mainly on the chin due to hormonal acne) so I know what you are going thru.  What I\\'m currently on is called spirnolactone.  It\\'s helped in the hormonal aspect of my acne although I do get cysts still.  Have you asked your doctor about this medication?  If you read the web, alot of women who have PCOS take spiro.  Can I ask you, what kind of tests did you take to know you have it?  I have chin acne, facial hair but regular periods.  I know PCOS is known for the chin acne and excess facial hair and irregular periods .  I have considered doing accutane so I don\\'t have to be on anymore medication (i take 100mg a day of spiro) so I wanted to find out your opinion on accutane.  Did the accutane make you depressed?  Anyways, check out the spiro.  It has helped me for over a year.\\nYou might also want to try saw palmetto.  It binds with the testosterone in your system, so will reduce how much you have floating around, which is why PCOS has a tendency to cause acne.  I had acne from PCOS and it stopped once I started taking saw palmetto and I went on the South Beach diet.  Everything I\\'ve read about PCOS seems to indicate that insulin spikes are really the underlying evil, and the South Beach diet is specifically for reducing the spikes of sugar and insulin, so I figured, hey why not give it a try.  Now, my face is clear, and my periods have come back after being gone for 3 years.\\nHey  =)\\nThere\\'s several ways you can tackle this problem.  The first thing you need to know is whether your PCOS is caused by a Progesterone Defficiency or Insulin Resistance.  I think both can be cured the same way, but if you don\\'t want to change your diet, then you might want to figure that out.\\n\\nPrometheus and I, were both dx as PCOS, although I claim Insulin Resistant because I don\\'t have any of the typical \"symptoms\".   I\\'m underwieght and with regular cycles.  My only hormonal problems were TERRIBLE menstrual cramps, mild hirsutism, hairloss/retention, and of course....Acne (anywhere you can imagine).  If you read around this board you will see that both of us, as well as others, used diet to get rid of most of hormonal problems, including greatly reducing or eliminating our acne!\\n\\nDietary changes was THE most effective thing I ever did for myself and I\\'ve been on everything but accutane!  I tried\\n-\\nfor 3 years and\\n- Spironolactone for a little over a year.  I\\'ve actually been on Spiro for nearly 6 years, but finally dropped it about 2 months ago.  Now the only thing I am using to treat myself is my diet.\\n\\nAside from the prescriptions I mentioned above, women with PCOS are sometimes misdiagnosed and actually have NCCAH (Non-classical congential adrenal hyperplasia).  The symptoms are very similar, but under hormonal tests they will find that you are lacking an enzyme neccessary to make cortisol.  This of course would throw your hormones off and increase your testosterone, because your body would keep trying to produce cortisol, which keeps increasing your other hormones.  The treatment for this is a glucocorticoid, such as\\n.\\n\\n\\nOtherwise, if you have PCOS due to a progesterone defficiency, you would just take progesterone to balance things out.  If this is what you need, you tell  them you want\\n(forget the name), no SYNTHETIC crap  ;-)  Or you can use\\n(NPC) to fix things.  If that makes you uncomfortable you can take\\n(chaste tree berry), which apparently balances things out, buy telling your brain to increase progesterone production  =)\\n\\nNow, some people breakout from progesterone cream or vitex and it\\'s probably because they don\\'t need it.  Progesterone is anti-androgenic and also has the ability to convert itself into one of the Estrogens or Androgens (don\\'t want more male hormones).  Yet, one poster realized that she was PCOS and reduced her copper levels and used NPC to get clear and regulate her menstrual cycles.\\n\\nThere\\'s lots of Insulin balancing supplements, such as\\n,\\n,\\n,\\n, etc. Plus, as others mentioned, there\\'s also the thought of taking\\n,\\n, or\\nas anti-androgens.  Unfortunately for me, I\\'ve taken 1800mg of Saw Palmetto for months, while on Avandia-Spiro, and it didn\\'t improve my acne at all.  LOL, and that\\'s interesting because most people, male and female, report improvements in the 200 - 600mg range.  So my guess is that since I was already taking spiro and it\\'s the herbal equivalent, it wasn\\'t going to do anymore for me, than Spiro did.  ;-)\\n\\nThat brings up a good point, that if you are Insulin Resistant (most people are), medication nor supplements, can fully replace what a proper hormonally balanced healthy diet can.  It\\'s like taking cholesterol lowering drugs, but you are still eating foods that increase your cholesterol levels....it\\'s counter productive.  Well, at least thats how my story was and it appears to run this way for a few others.\\n\\nYet, whatever you decide to do, know that they all have the potential and have achieved such results as eliminating acne, regulating menstrual cycles, eliminating menstrual pain, reducing hirsutism, lowering weight, shrinking ovarian cysts, and I think the most wonderful of all for those that had problems, given women the ability to concieve.\\n.\\nThank you Saira2,\\nWell the first test was done because I was trying to get pregnant, I\\'ve really never had a regular period, I have skin tags and the acne is soo severe. I went to my obgyn and had a blood test performed. The blood test revealed that it was in fact PCOS. Fortunately I concieved my beautiful daughter Lexy in March of 2001, I was on 250 mg of Clomid. A year before that I tried the Accutane. I personally would not suggest the accutane, when I began taking it I broke out so bad that I did not even go to work for 2-3 weeks, (I lost my job).  Then after the 4-6 week I began to notice a difference, however once the medication was finished within 6 months my breakouts where even worse and they became even more painful.  More times than not I was feeling very agitated, and sad. All I wanted to do was cry and sleep. I would not even go out to get the mail. I didn’t want to be around anyone.\\nAfter I did some research on the Accutane I realized that I had been feeling like that because of the medication. Of course everyone has a different reaction to this med, however I’ve heard more horror stories than good. I also read an article where a lady had taken accutane for 2 years straight, and she was extremely happy with it, unfortunately a few years later she began having liver problems, according to her Dr. it was caused by the Accutane.  So I strongly vote against it, but like I said, some people have different reactions to it. Good Luck and hope everything goes good with you…\\nThis may be a stupid question...but I am very interested in this PCOS/hormonal theory. It makes so much sense for me. I had perfect beautiful skin until I was about 25 - since then I have battled cystic acne mainly on my chin/jawline. I have tried a lot that helps - but only temporaily. My doctor said my hormones were fine because she did a series of thyroid tests on me and there is no reason to believe it is hormonal!! I am going to find another doctor because iIreally feel that this has been my problem all along. I have VERY irregular periods, mood swings, and cystic acne. Can you guys PLEASE tell me exactly what tests I need to ask for so when I find a new doctor, I can tell him what I want and not get a bunch of unnecessary tests done? Thank-you!!\\nHi Jade,\\nwell you certianly look like you know what you\\'re talking about, thank you for the info, I actually copied and pasted this info into my notebook in order to bring some of these things up to my Dr. I really don\\'t know what kind of PCOS I have, all I know is that I have an elevated LH surge and elevated testosterone levels. My last period was on Thankgiving, after that nothing. I have a really bad feeling I may have been pregnant and had a miscarriage at the time because it was extremely painful, more than usual, and there was some really funky stuff coming out, plus it was extremely heavy. I don\\'t know. Anyways, I really hope that this horrible nightmare will go away, my face hurts so much. I try to use Clinique cover up, but make-up can only do so much. Thank you very much.\\n\\nHey sweetie, I\\'m sorry that you are also going through this.\\nAs far as tests, my OBGYN did a testosterone test, and LH test. I also had a progestrone test perform which concluded that I had PCOS. I began with the exact symptoms you have. Call your Dr. and set up the appt. Tell him/her that you would like to get tested for the PCOS, he/she will know what tests you need. Good Luck hun...Keep us updated!!\\nI was wondering about something, I mean the chances of me getting pregnant again are slim to none, I already have a beautiful daughter and I\"m happy with her. If I were to get a Hysterectomy will that solve my acne problems? I know it will solve most hormonal issues we have...please advise\\n\\nYou mentioned copper.  That was one other thing that I did after I found out about the PCOS that I forgot to mention.  When I got a hair mineral analysis done (which I definitely recommend, helps you know what you\\'re trying to balance), I had high copper, and I think that\\'s a normal problem w/ PCOS, and that\\'s part of what leads to the high testosterone.  I think some people might have collected the copper while on the pill, since the pill causes you to collect copper, and it seems like a lot of people have their PCOS start after quitting the pill (probably started sometime during the pill, but was masked until coming off).  Anyway, I just took a molybdenum supplement for a while, and that took care of the extra copper, and was a very easy way to get rid of that copper.\\nThank you all for you info and advise. I have an appt with my derm on Feb 19, 2004. I\\'ll let you know what happens.\\nHi!  I did not read all the posts. But I had a case of severe acne.  I don\\'t have it anymore. It is very easy to get rid of it. You need high dose of probiotics. Specially accidophilus. THas all!!! You can buy it in any pharmacy. 3 tablets 1 hour before every meal, you will see that in a couple of days, the acne will reduce and then dissapear. Try it!',\n",

       " {'post': 'My doctor diagnosed me with Polycystic ovaries today.  She supected it last time I was there and did blood work and it turns out that I have it.  I am so devastated b/c I am currently tyring to conceive.  My doctor is going to have my husband go through a semen analysis just to make sure he is normal and then I think she is going to start me on clomid.  My dr. seems positive but I was and still am so upset over this.  I think back to all the years I was on the pill preventing pregnancy and how I would panic if I took a pill an hour later than normal.  I always thought that I\\'d just stop taking the pill and get pregnant.  This isn\\'t what I thought my husband and I would have to deal with when wanting to start a family.  I\\'ve read through  a lot of posts on this site and pcos seems really common and I know a lot of women successfully conceive, it\\'s just frustrating that some women can look at their husbands and get pregnant and others have to go through so many trials.  Sorry to vent on here, I just dont\\' think I can talk to anyone in my family right now until it sinks in a little more.  I\\'ve read a lot about women going on low carb diets to naturally treat pcos?  Does anyone on here know anything about that? I\\'m not overweight at all, would this still help me? Does anyone know of any natural or home remedies that I can try on my own?  Thanks for reading.\\ni too have PCOS and i have been on clomid for 2 months now with no success... but im not giving up hope... i think it will happen for us soon... i am also on 2 other drugs along with clomid hoping to start ovulateing soon... i have heard many success stories... hope it happens for us both, soon!\\nI can relate to how you feel.  It frustrates me too to see people getting pregnant at the drop of a hat while we have been trying almost 2 years.  Its unfair but I try and just focus on me rather than other people.  Easier said than done of course...........it still upsets me.\\nI\\'m not sure what is wrong with me but I\\'m on clomid which has regulated my periods if nothing else.\\nMy sister had PCOS and now has 2 boys aged 1 and 4.  Clomid did not work for her (not to say it won\\'t work for you though) but injections did.  I felt so sorry for her when she worried about not having a baby and used to say if the worst came to the worst I\\'d be a surrogate mother for her.  Little did I know I\\'d face fertility problems too, its unbelieveable really.\\n\\nI do know how you feel but stay positive.  Clomid works for many people and hopefully it will work for you too.  If it doesn\\'t though, there are so many other things you can do.  Like you said there are so many success stories with this condition.  You could be the next!\\nThank you so much for your responses.  I also found out that I did not get a job that I had really hoped for so today has just been a day of bad news!\\nYour replies and hearing your stories have helped though.  Please keep me posted on your lives and I\\'ll do the same! Thanks again!!\\nrenee,\\ni\\'m so sorry that you are down. i also have pcos and i was diagnosed in march although my husband and are were ttc since last october. i was caught off guard because i never would have thought that i had it. i had always hd regular periods before i went on the pill three years ago and always assumed that it would be easy for me. so needless to say i was totally devastated and heartbroken. i never had any of the signs most people associate with pcos and noone i knew had ever had it. so i was terrified and felt really alone.\\ni wanted to write to you and tell you that there is hope for you and all women with pcos. i know because i finally got pregnant this month. it took 2 cycles of clomid and an iui but it happened. i know and pray that it will happen for you too. i know that it\\'s very hard to see the light at the end  of the tunnel sometimes, but hang in there and have faith that one day soon you\\'ll be a mom\\nmy advice is to really educate yourself on pcos so that it doesn\\'t seem as scary.and i hope you have a good doctor who knows a lot about it. also, has your doctor talked to you about the drug metformin? it\\'s very useful for lots of us. it was for me.\\nlet me know if i can answer any questions for you and know that you are not alone. it\\'s a lot more common that you (or i ) think but it can be overcome and most people can go on to have as many childeren as they want.\\nlots of hugs and best of luck to you.\\nnastabasta--thank you so much for your message.  it did make me smile.  i know this isn\\'t the worst thing that could happen, but it\\'s sad b/c it\\'s not what i expected.  CONGRATULATIONS on your pregnancy\\nI know one day I\\'ll have that same feeling.  I\\'ve done a lot of reading on pcos and I just purchased a book about it.  It\\'s just really hard b/c i don\\'t think that anyone (unless they\\'ve gone through something like this) can really know how it feels.  My mom is trying to be supportive but points out baby stuff everytime we go shopping.  My hubby is awesome but I don\\'t think he really \"gets\" why I\\'m so upset.  We both know that I should be able to have kids but I don\\'t think he understands the feeling that I have because my body is not working the way it\\'s supposed to.\\nI\\'ll let you all know my progress and I hope you\\'ll do the same.  My husband has to go for a sperm analysis to make sure he\\'s normal before my dr. will start me on anything.  So I\\'ll let you all know what she puts me on and I\\'ll definitely ask about metformin--that seems to have been successful for a lot of women.  Thanks again for your support..you ladies are AWESOME!\\n\\nyou\\'re welcome renee.\\ni know that everything will work out for you. and you are definitely not alone. this site and others like it have been so helpful to me because i can talk to other women who really get what i feel. my mom and mil\\'s way of helping me was to tell me to relax and take it easy. it was like they just didn\\'t get how stressful it is to have your body not work properly. a lot of people just don\\'t know how to be helpful or what to say. my sil\\'s way of dealing with it was to ignore me for 2 months!!\\nanyway, hang in there and best of luck to you and your husband. i look forward to hearing about your  progress.\\nDon\\'t worry.\\nMy mother has PCOS, so do I. I am 18 and I have already found out that I have it. Needless to say, I\\'m here\\n\\nDon\\'t give up!',\n",

       " {'post': 'I visited my new gynecologist today because of all of my period problems, and she thinks I may have PCOS.  Apparently I have quite a few symptoms, obesity, skin tags and discoloration, irregular periods, etc.  I\\'m going to have bloodwork to check my hormone levels, as well as an internal/external sonogram in the coming weeks.  She also mentioned that I could have endometriosis, which is what I thought of all along, but wants to rule out PCOS first.\\n\\nIf this is indeed what I have, I was wondering what all exactly I should be aware of.  I\\'ve read some info on the internet and it\\'s sort of freaking me out a bit.  If anyone out there who has PCOS could give me some basic information on what to expect, treatments, long term care, etc, I\\'d be so grateful.  Of course I don\\'t know if this is what I have, but I\\'d like to get some background information.  I already know a ton about endometriosis from the fellow posters here, but don\\'t really know anything about PCOS.\\n\\nThank you all for your time!\\n\\nSteph\\nPCOS is basically best described as one big hormonal mess!  The best thing you can do for yourself if you get a diagnosis of PCOS is to educate yourself.  There are many great resources out there, including this forum.  There are many PCOS women on this forum, myself included.  PCOS can be controlled by diet, exercise and oftentimes by medications.  Initially, it can be difficult to gain control of it because you have to tackle multiple symptoms, but it can be done.  Best wishes to you....and please, keep us posted.\\nbarton93,\\n\\nThank you so much for your post.  I\\'ve been doing some online research on PCOS, including on this website, so that has helped me tremendusly.  I\\'ll keep you posted after I get the test from my doctor.\\n\\nThanks so much!\\n\\nSteph\\nWhat symptoms do you both have and what are you doing to fight them? What are your periods like, (heavy, light, short, long, painful, clots)? I am not sure which disease is causing each problem! Thanks, I have talked with both of you on this board before and am grateful for your help and respect your comments.\\nJazzz,\\n\\nWe\\'re old friends from when I posted the thread \"Could I have Endometriosos?\"  You, Kermit and a buch of others were such a great help to me.  I\\'ve *finally* found me a doctor that is going to look into actual problems instead of prescribing a new birth control pill.\\n\\nMy symptoms are very irregular periods, even on birth control.  As of this coming Monday, I\\'ll have had my current period for 3 weeks, which has never happened before.  I started a week before my pills said I was scheduled for, and now I\\'m about to go on week three.  I\\'ve had periods that lasted for two weeks, but never three.  Usually it starts out with brown blood, not bright red until the 3rd day or so, when it gets very heavy.  The pain is so extreme, which runs down my right thigh.  I have a pulling, pinching pain in my lower left pelvic area, which usually comes before and during my period, but does also happen any time.  I have diarrhea 90% of the time, and I have to urinate a lot.  OTC meds only take the edge off the pain, and I\\'ve been prescribed Darvocet for when I can\\'t function.  I started my period on my 11th birthday (now 24) and they\\'ve been horrible as far back as I can remember.  My mom mentioned to me the other day, that when I was around 10, my weight ballooned, which was just before I started my first period.  I was a thin child prior to this, not overweight at all.  I\\'ve had my thyroid checked (my mom had this done after my accessive weight gain in my early teens), but that was normal.  I\\'ve been on 5 different bcp\\'s since the age of 16, none of which help for more than 3 months.  This is the first doctor who\\'s ever taken my concerns seriously, and who\\'s mentioned a hormone test, doing different exams and procedures to find out what\\'s wrong.  I\\'ve had an internal vaginal sonogram before, but this was done at the hospital, not by a gyn., and my gynecologist said that if I do have PCOS, the first sonogram wouldn\\'t probably have picked up on it b/c the technician wasn\\'t looking for that, just looking for my ovaries (which she had a hard time finding.)\\n\\nNow, after I say this all, Jazzz, I\\'m not sure if you were directing your questions to me or Barton.\\nBut I\\'m sure it can\\'t hurt to post things here.\\nIt\\'s nice to hear from you again, Jazzz, and you too, Barton.  Thanks so much for your help, ladies!\\n\\nSteph\\nNo, I meant both of you!!! Thanks. I always become uncertain of myself and just need a little reassurance. I will write more soon!\\nI was diagnosed with PCOS over two years ago. I had not had a period in four months, they were NEVER regular unless I was on the pill. I didn\\'t want to take BC pills anymore because of the horrible decrease in libido. When I stopped, my libido came back like a sailor on leave! My specialist (gyn) said that was a big clue that it was in fact PCOS. Normal free-testosterone levels are at 1 or below, mine was over 4! He immediately put me on progesterone (14 days every three months to bring on a period) and metformin. Metformin is a glucose-regulating med used mostly by diabetics to control their insulin. (Your ovary function is related to your insulin, that\\'s why the metformin!) Over the first year, he had to increase my metformin because it wasn\\'t working after about 9 months. However, I have lost 27 pounds since the end of January and my periods have returned! I still take the metformin, and probably will for the rest of my life, but no more progesterone! My testosterone levels are staying around 1, so he says as long as the periods are still coming at about the same rate, I don\\'t have to take the hormones. My sex drive is great, very high with no adverse effects from the meds. He said that is good as long as the levels stay low.\\nAt first I felt that my \"female\" body was betraying me when I got diagnosed. Now I realize that this has plagued me my whole life, causing a lengthy conception period and irregular periods since they started. I have a reason for it all now, and I feel much better knowing that I can control it with simple meds and diet changes.\\n\\n\\nHi Jazz,\\n\\nI have many PCOS symptoms.  Here they are:\\n\\n*  Very irregular periods - an average of a few each year.\\n\\n*  Hair growth in all the unwanted areas.  I have noticed that the hair on my legs even grows at a faster rate, and I have more hair on my arms as well.\\n\\n*  My vision has changed.\\n\\n*  I was diagnosed with diabetes in 1997.\\n\\n*  The lining of my uterus was 4 x’s thicker than it should have been due to not having a period, which puts me at a high risk for ovarian cancer.\\n\\n*  My cholesterol level is high, which also puts me at high risk for heart disease.\\n\\n*  It took me almost 2 years to conceive my 2nd child, when it took me about 5 minutes to conceive my 1st child, and on top of that my hormones were so out of whack, that I had to take hormone shots the 1st 4 months of my pregnancy, in order for my uterus to hold the baby.\\n\\n*  I have gained about 50 pounds.\\n\\n*  I have lost a lot of hair as well.  I used to have a head full of beautiful wavy thick hair.  Now my hair is pretty thin and the texture has changed.  It’s nasty now.\\n\\n*  I also feel as if my muscles have been affected tremendously as well.  I am very weak.  I feel as if all of my muscle strength has disappeared.\\n\\n*  I also suffer from constant fatigue.\\n\\n*  I have problems with my circulation as well (3 times I have woken up in the morning with my left arm a purplish color and limp as a noodle.  I cannot feel nothing.  Then about an hour after waking up, it goes back to normal, but remains sore the rest of the day)…….possibly from my diabetes.\\n\\nWell, these are most of my symptoms.  The way I control all of my symptoms is by diet, exercise and I also take medication for my diabetes (Metformin) and I also take birth control pills.',\n",

       " {'post': \"Hello again all  :-)\\n\\nIt's been a while. Here's an update. Been dieting for just over 2 mos., am down somewhere between 12-15 lbs. which is good, but still have more to go. I have been slacking on the excercise, but now that it's nice out, have been walking/bike riding with the kids (chasing a 3 yr old on a 2 wheeler w/training wheels!). Here's what I am wondering if anyone knows much about. . . . .I was diagnosed with PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) about 10 yrs ago, which I now know makes dieting HARD. I think it's like I'm hungry all the time, blood sugar screws up and I get shaky, not really sure what else though, I need to research it more.\\n\\nNow I want to quit smoking. (I need to anyway, but if I do, it'll save ALOT of money!) I am a stay-at-home mom, so the extra $5000 a year will really help, it may even make it so I can stay home and not go back to work once the little one is in school (along with a couple other budget adjustments...lol) but I'm worried that if I do, all I'll want to do is snack and eat. You always hear about people who gain 20lbs when they quit smoking. Smoking does curb my appetite, and if I stop, I know I'll eat junk food. Has anyone faced this? Any suggestions? I've tried the carrots/celery for snacking, but if I'm craving chips/dip or choclate, I can see the lbs coming back. Maybe I just need some encouragement. Any comments would be greatly appreciated. Always open to suggestions!\\n\\nThanks---Scorpiomom\\n\\nYou may want to ship the kiddos off to daycare and get a gym membership...something to get you out of the house or workout at night. It is really hard to find motivation when you are stuck at home.\\n\\nQuitting the cigs is a great start, but you should get yourself on some kind of routine that you can follow to meet your weight loss goals.\\n\\nIf you want to stop eatting as much, try a very low carb diet...it naturally makes you eat less or you can always try appetite supressing supplements(first choice is better). Since I'm guessing you do most of the shopping, try to convince your husband to do low carb with you so you can only buy foods that are oriented to this goal. If you buy chips and snacks that is what you will eat...\\nI quit smoking and did not gain any weight at all.  I think that if you expect to gain weight and eat as a substitute for cigs, then you get what you expect.  If you have irregular periods, you might get a pleasant surprise when you quit.  Mine were very irregular before.  They could be as sporadic as every 4 months.  I quit at the end of January and now I get my period about every 45 days and I ovulate.\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I keep seeing that on threads but have never heard of it.\\nit is where you develop cysts, acne like activity, on your ovaries, and it interferes with hormonal production, or is the result of hormonal production. It can lead to irregular periods and loss of fertility.\\nIt stands for Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome, I believe.\\nI wonder if this is something I may have. I know that my acne is hormonal but my doctor thought I should try accutane b/c he thought it doesn\\'t matter why I break out, that should eliminate it no matter what.\\n\\nI looked at some of the symptoms on line and I don\\'t have a lot of them. Mainly that I break out and I think I am glucose intolerant. I\\'ve tried to make an appointment with an endocrinologist but none of them would even see me.\\n\\nWell even if the accutane does work, I still plan on sticking to a low carb diet just because I feel so much better on it.\\nAlmostpretty,\\nTo put it bluntly, if you have a underlying hormonal problem, accutane will never cure you.  From what I\\'ve read, it doesn\\'t cure anyone...even Roche says it\\'s anti-androgenic effects\\nreturn after treatment ceases (could take months - years to return though).  Therefore, those that only take one course (we have people that have taken 5 courses and STILL have acne), probably were facing Pubertal Acne or a short bout of Adult Acne.\\n\\nNow, PCOS stands for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.  This is also known as Syndrome X, Syndrome O, Stein-Leventhal Syndrome, and Insulin Resistance.  There are 2 forms of PCOS:\\n\\nInsulin Resistance =  increase Testosterone Levels\\n\\nFSH/LH Imbalance = decreased Progesterone levels\\n\\nI\\'m far from an expert, but I don\\'t know if Insulin Resistance leads to both forms of PCOS or only one.  Yet, I do know that women with ovarian cysts still improved on a form of Low Carbohydrate diet  =)\\n\\nI personally have the Insulin Resistance form of PCOS.  My doctor actually said \"you are either PCOS or IR, but either way we use the same treatments.\"  I do not have typical PCOS symptoms, which is what misleads doctors into false diagnosis of patients.  I am one of the Thin Cysters, although I do not have cystic ovaries, LOL.  I\\'m underwieght, perfect menstural cycles, normal blood pressure, normal cholesterol, etc.  On the \"PCOS and Acne\" post I go into detail about what my symptoms were, etc, but again I stress, you do not have to have all these \"symptoms\" .\\n\\nIt sounds like if you feel better on a Low Carb diet you may have the IR form.  What are the rest of your hormonal or physical \"symptoms\" to this syndrome? You also mentioned that you might be Glucose Intolerant, well that describes Insulin Resitance and if you do, you want to keep on that diet in order to prevent you from entering into full blown resistance...Type II Diabetes!\\n\\nSo definately get yourself to an Endocrinologist and get tested (I listed some tests on the other thread)  Depending on your hormone levels you will either use Insulin Sensitizing Drugs, Progesterone, or anti-androgens (Birth Control and/or Spironolactone).  Although, ALL of those drugs serve the same purpose...they all act as anti-androgens (and hormone balancers) in one form or another  ;-)\\n\\nPersonally, if you find that yours is sooo stubborn that you are stuck on 5 medications, you may want to\\n. I mean, if an Insulin Sensitizer can fix things...doesn\\'t it make sense for us to all just start by actually following a diet that\\'s Anti-Insulin Resistant???  Yet, your doctor won\\'t stress this or if he does, it will be to tell you to eat Whole grains (which is better than Refined/white grains), but it\\'s not as good as going Gluten-Free  (or No Grain).  If you are intested in that, just read \"the Diet threads,\" LOL.\\n\\nBest of luck and take care  =)\\nSweet Jade,\\nI have also always been thin, and have regular mestrual cycles. The reason I have always thought my acne was hormonal is because I don\\'t break out when I am on an estrogen birth control pill. I just hate being on the pill because all I want to do on it is sleep. I have no energy!\\n\\nMy skin also gets alot better when I eat low carb. It\\'s just that I get alot of pressure from everyone around me who think I am to thin. It\\'s hard to explain that I am doing it for my skin and because I feel better. And you know most diets are manageable when you can cheat one day a week or something like that. But with this I can never cheat.\\n\\nOne question: Do you eat raw honey? Does it cause a glucose spike?\\nby the way, i eat raw honey. it is so good for us and yes it does cause glucose spikes, but my body can manage glucose properly, because it has enough magnesium to do so.',\n",

I have been reading up on this all day long and I swear alot of the symptoms are alot like hypothyroidism. There are a few things that I have wrong that don't go along with hypo. I have facial hair in all the wrong places, have had cysts on my ovaries in the past, very painful periods, and a few more that I saw listed. My thyroid hormones are leveled out, but the only way I can lose weight is to take my carbs really, really low (ketosis) which is dangerous for too long. I read today that PCOS can cause insulin resistance. HMMMMM??????\\nDoes anyone take glucophage for their PCOS? I also read this several times today.\\nIt's time for my annual next month so I think I will discuss this with my OB/Gyn.\\nHi Miper\\nI have PSOC too! Along with Hashi hypo. I have discused this with me GP and she mentioned that there was a need to monitor my sugar level due to the disease. At this point I'm fine. I'm not really interested in taking a pill unless I have too. I too have the ugly un wanted in the wrong place hair. Thats really the only thing that bothers me. Now my Thyroid problem is a whole different story. I'm thinking if it would balance out it would help all the other hormones balance to. There is lots of info on the web about PSOC and the treatment.\\nDoes it mean anything when you severely, and I do mean severely painful ovulation?\\n\\nAre you sure it's ovulation?  Could it be a cyst rupturing?  I have a friend diagnosed with PCOS and she's had some very painful cyst ruptures.  Funny how timely this topic is.  Saw my doctor today, and we're running a couple of tests to rule out other problems, but are 90+% sure I've got PCOS as well which is probably causing my hypertension which is probably causing my elevated pulse, which is causing part of my fatigue.  Along with other symptoms.  The hair thing is what's helping to narrow it down.\\n\\nI don't know what it is. It seems to be around the time I should ovulate. I've always been able to feel myself ovulate, but in the last few months it has become so painful, I have to take 800 mgs of Motrin to even slightly feel some relief. If you have cysts, or have had in the past, does it mean you more than likely have it? I don't know too much about it. I am going to spend some time tomorrow doing some reading up on it. I did look at some of the symptoms and I have quite a few.\\nI'll ask my friend who is quite experienced with just about everything that could go wrong in that area.\\nWow, I appreciate it!\\nHi guys\\n\\n\\nI have had PCOS for years.  My doctor once told me that having PCOS caused insulin intolerance....which could lead to weight gain, tiredness, mood swings.  (some of the same symptoms as being hypo)\\n\\nShe said that PCOS was part of a vicious cycle:  your body doesn't convert insulin properly, which causes you to have a hard time losing weight -but losing weight would bring the PCOS better under control, along with your insulin lvels. And having your insulin levels out of control feeds the PCOS.\\n\\nI sure hope that made sense, cause it did when she was explaining it to me.\\n\\nI, too have painful ovulation.  The older I get, it seems like the more pain is involved.  I grab onto the Ibuprofen or Acetaminophen during this time like it is a lifeline.\\n\\nI have the wonderful dark hair growing in places that it should not on my body - mostly my facial area (yuck).\\n\\nI do know that the lower-carb diets help a lot with PCOS, as it gets your insulin levels in a more constant range, and helps with losing weight.\\nOver the past 21 years, when my weight was in the desireable range (according to insurance charts), my thyroid levels were fantastic (while on meds)  my PCOS was almost non-existant.  I became pregnant 3 times during these years...all 3 pregnancies while I was in good physical shape.\\n(one of the preg. ended in miscarriage).\\n\\nI have had one cyst burst...and it felt nothing like the painful ovulation that I have.  That cyst bursting had me on my knees in pain, throwing up and almost passing out.  The ovulation pain isn't anywhere near that - though it does have me in bed with a heating pad and plenty of meds to take the pain away.\\n\\nI think (and it IS my thinking, after dealing with this for years and doing a lot of research on my own) that the thyroid connection to PCOS is HUGE.\\n\\nHUGS to you all.\\nI had one burst one time and I passed out cold in the middle of Wal-mart. Of course before I had the ultrasound, I had no clue what was wrong with me. It scared me half to death. In fact, I thought I was dying it hurt so bad.\\nAfter reading everything, I am almost 100% sure I have this.\\nI have to get out of this vivious cycle some way, some how or I am scared I am going to end up diabetic.\\nWish me luck........going to my GP today to get this ball (PCOS) rolling. I don't know if I should go to an OB/GYN or my Endo. for this? Next month I have an appointment with a new Endo. that supposedly knows a little more about thyroid issues than my current, so hopefully this guy will help me out with everything else also.

       " {'post': 'Are their any alternative medications for Polycystic ovarian syndrome?\\nHey there,\\n\\nThere are a few things one can do to combat PCOS.\\n\\nRun a search for \"Glycemic Index\" and AVOID like the plague all foods that elevate glucose levels in the blood!\\n\\n1000mcg of Chromium Picolinate is ESSENTIAL!!\\n\\n\\n\"IF\" the person with PCOS is overweight, they need to lose weight..yesterday.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have any success with the above info, there is always metformin.\\n\\nYou need an eating plan that balances insulin (low glycemic foods, no sugar or sugar analogs)\\nhormones. Many PCOS folks also suffer from insulin resistance.\\n\\nFirst, let me make sure that you understand what insulin resistance IS. The\\ninsulin process works like this:\\nWhen you eat carbohydrates (a pear or carrot, say), glucose is released into the blood stream. This, in turn, triggers an insulin response. Insulin converts some of the glucose into glycogen and hauls it off to the liver and muscle tissue for temporary storage for use when blood sugar falls. Since short term storage capacity is limited, any excess glucose is converted by the insulin into triglycerides (that\\'s fat to you and me  ) for long term storage.\\nOk...still following?\\nWhen blood sugar drops, glucagon is produced and it trots off to the liver and grabs the stored glycogen from short term storage and dumps it back into the bloodstream to be converted back to glucose, thus cranking your blood sugar back up.\\nThis is all well and good,\\nblood sugar is released\\n\\ninto the bloodstream which in turn means a controlled release of insulin.\\n\\ncomes into play when a diet rich in high-glycemic carbos (and sugar) is eaten. These carbohydrates are converted to glucose nearly instantly which means an equal amount of insulin is triggered. The excess insulin results in sharp drop of blood sugar - which makes you feel tired, therefore craving more fuel (carbohydrates) and voila! you have a vicious cycle with:\\n> consistently high insulin levels\\n> insulin working overtime to reduce excess glucose but can\\'t keep up therefore, bang! you gain weight\\n> cells stop responding to insulin and won\\'t store excess fat\\n> excess glucose therefore can\\'t be converted to fat and stays in bloodstream where it\\'s veddy veddy bad for your heart, kidneys, eyes, blood vessels, nerves.\\nStill with me?\\nYou need low glycemic foods and cut out the SUGAR!  You need to eat more apples and fewer grapes, for example. Or more celery and fewer carrots. AND you need to cut out refined sugar and it\\'s analogs (no cakes! no cookies! no meal replacement bars, etc). Research shows that the ONLY sweetener which does NOT trigger an insulin response, is Stevia. All the others do. Yes, that means aspartame, sweet n low, and even Splenda. So no soda pop!\\nIn addition, you need a diet rich in GLA and omegas to balance your hormones. What you need, IMHO, is the Fat Flush Plan (FFP) which is designed to restore balance to your daily diet AND to control insulin levels by emphasizing low-glycemic foods and the importance of eating lean protein to help slow absorption (and eating protein burns fat. WAhoooooo!) in addition to balancing hormones.\\nSeveral of my friends who suffer from PCOS have done quite well on the FFP and not only that, they FEEL so much better. I highly recommend it.\\n\\'Course I\\'m biased, having lost 58 pounds on the FFP, myself. (\\nI tell you what!)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbest wishes,\\ncharli\\nhighest wt: 233\\n203/146/146\\nLost 50 pounds in first 5 months. Have maintained wt loss for 6+ months and counting.\\n\\nI went on the South Beach diet, and it cured my PCOS.  My only real symptoms were no periods (at all for 3 years), and cysts on my ovaries.  I wasn\\'t overweight, hirsute, and didn\\'t have acne.  After 3 months on the diet, my periods came back and were normal for 3 months.  Now, I\\'m pregnant, so they\\'re gone again, but for a good reason this time\\n\\nI also cleared out the copper from my system, which I think had something to do with the periods coming back.  I did this before I went on the diet.  My bloodwork showed I had high testosterone, so I did some research, and that can be caused by high copper, and the pill can actually cause your body to store more copper than normal (my periods stopped after the pill and never came back).  So, I got a hair mineral analysis done, and my copper sure enough was high.  So, I supplemented with molybdenum and the copper levels got lower (molybdenum is a very potent copper chelating agent).  And, my reaction that I used to have to garlic, onions, and eggs went away.  When I got to thinking about it, I realized that had started happening after I started the pill.  I finally researched it and found out that molybdenum is required for your body to metabolize sulfites and sulfates, which garlic, onions, and eggs are rich in.  Copper and molybdenum compete in your body, so my high copper meant I had low molybdenum, and this was causing the reaction.  Funny how such different things turn out to be related in the end.\\n\\nOne more thing that might help is ground flaxseed.  It\\'s been found to bind to excess hormones.  Also, I used Evening Primrose Oil (EPO) during the cycle I got pregnant.  A lot of the things I found suggest EPO in the first half of the cycle and flaxseed in the second half.\\n\\nMy doc says there\\'s no substitute for a low carb or good carb diet (IR diets are good, too) and exercise for people with PCOS.  He was very happy with me that the diet made everything better, even though he had prescribed Metformin and I quit taking it.  I thought I was going to get a lecture for stopping my prescribed meds, but instead got praise.',\n",

       " {'post': 'I was diagnosed w/ Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) in November of 2004. My Dr put me on metphormine (1000 mg per day) to help with this. So far, nothing is better. At the end of April 2005, I was diagnosed with sleep apnea. I’m so exhausted all the time that functioning is getting harder and harder. It takes about all that I have to get through an 8-hour workday. Both my Apnea and PCOS doctors say if I could lose some weight it would help both problems. But, both Apnea and PCOS cause weight gain. Both docs even said it would be next to impossible for me to lose it right now. I guess I’m just looking to vent. I’m so frustrated right now. My weight is out of control. I think I’m currently at about 280lbs, I’m 5’3” tall, and I’m 24 years old. The PCOS has also caused higher testosterone, which lead to dark upper lip hair, receipting hairline, stray hairs on my chin and chest, and painful acne. So needless to say, I’m feeling pretty “unfeminine” & ugly lately. My self esteem wasn’t that great to begin with, but its just gone downhill with all of this. Has anyone had any luck with PCOS treatments other than weight loss? I’m struggling with the Apnea (have posts on the sleep disorders board too), but I thought some one who has struggled with PCOS might have some ideas for me. I know that exercise helps, but with me being so tired, that is hard for me to do. The weight is getting to a point where getting around can be difficult and painful. I know that it is mostly because of the PCOS that I am as big as I am, so I’m at a loss as to what to do. I’m just so tired of feeling so crappy all the time and feeling so tired on top of it. Please help if anyone knows anything! Thanks!!!\\nMy DR had to up my metformin b/c it wasn\\'t working. I now take 1500mg/day. Even so, I was still needing to take the progesterone every 3 months to get a period. since January 25th, I\\'ve lost 27 pounds and have NOT had to take progesterone- my periods are becoming regular! Maybe you should try to get your meds upped. Have they given you progesterone?\\n\\nI know you don\\'t think the weight loss will work, but trust me...\\nIt\\'s hard some days to get the exercise you need, but there are many simple things you can do. Park farther away at the store, or walk around in the store for an hour before you do your shopping. I know you\\'re tired with the apnea, but losing even 20 pounds can help that tremendously!\\n\\nThe metformin should help with the weight loss, and diet restriction gets easier after the first few weeks. I started at 265 (5\\'3\"), and now I\\'m down to 238 and down 2 sizes in clothes. YOU CAN DO IT! If your docs are telling you that you CAN\\'T lose the weight, FIND NEW ONES! Any doctor that poo-poos an attempt to get healthier should be reported. You CAN lose the weight, but you\\'ll need the support of EVERYONE around you. I am emailing everyday with a friend half-way around the world in the hopes that next time we see eachother, we\\'ll have a lot less of the other to hug. Find a buddy, it\\'s the first step! GOOD LUCK!',\n",

       " {'post': 'I have recently been diagnosed with having PCOS but the ultrasound showed no cysts on my ovaries.  How is this possible\\n?  I also have insulin resistance and I know that they often occur together but I really don\\'t understand how.  Can someone explain to me how this works?  I\\'m so lost!!!!!\\nYou dont have to have cysts on your ovaries to have PCOS.  I dont have them nor am I insulin resistant.  I do have the other common signs,facial hair,weight gain,and loss of hair.  The only blood test that came back funny was my DHEA levels which is another sign of PCOS.\\nThere are some women who have none of the common signs of PCOS but still have it just like there are women who have every common sign but dont have it.\\nThere are alot of great articles online that can help you understand more.  Do a search for PCOS and you will find them.\\nHi, I also have been diagnosed with PCOS and do not have cysts.  But I do have all of the symptoms.  I have severe acne when I am not taking BCP\\'s or androgen blockers, and have perfect, lovely skin when I am taking them.  However,the price for beautiful skin and very little body hair has been a weight gain of nearly 25 pounds.  I was on Diane35 and Aldactone.  I went off them to see how my symptoms were doing.  They came back with a vengeance.  I am now going to try Yasmin to see if I can lose weight while taking BCP\\'s.  I am now losing weight, as I am not on any BCP\\'s.  I have also cut way down on simple carbs and upped vitamin A, E and C, which is a \"power pack\" for skin.\\nI have a normal period, but my cycle is long, 35-38 days, instead of 28-30.  However, three doctors only had to look at the severity of my acne to know that it was hormonally induced.\\nI have done a lot of on-line research and have found very little about dealing with just symptoms and no cysts.  Is it possible, as you mention, that I have elevated androgen levels and do not have PCOS, even though I have been diagnosed with it?\\nThe other day a general practitioner asked me if I WANTED to take the Pill, as if it were an option.  Maybe I could just take androgen-blockers.  ?????\\nAny words of wisdom?\\nThanks!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nActually normal periods can range between 24 to 36 days and even then you can give or take a couple of days either way.  Before PCOS effected my cycles they were 34 days without BCP.  They were than way from the get go.  I had a few doctors tell me I wasnt normal because of that but as I got older and read for myself I learned that the average isnt that great of an idea.\\nThanks for answering!  Any experience with any of the meds (Diane35, Aldactone, Yasmin) and/or how to get rid of the symptoms (acne, weight gain, excess hair, etc.) I mentioned?\\nThanks!\\n\\ni dont really have an answer because we are too focus on getting pregnant despite the POCS.  So I am dealing with the symptoms that I have.\\n\\nHave you talked to your doctor about being on Glucophage?  It is normally used for diabetics but it can help those with PCOS. I have one friend on it and within two months of starting it she lost about 15 pounds.  So you could talk to your doctor about that treatment.  Also try to see an endocrinologist because they are actually better trained to deal with PCOS women.  they also know more in the areas of treatment.\\nDoes this sound like I have PCOS:\\n\\nI have no insulin resistance (Insulin level of 5, normal below 17)\\nI have normal glucose (Level of 88, normal between 65-105)\\nI have very light, soft body hair on my stomach and breasts\\nNormal TSH and Prolactin\\nLost 10 lbs since off the pill so I am 5\\'4\\'\\' 126lbs\\nMild acne (had it while on the pill and before)\\nNormal ovaries (not enlarged)\\nNo natural period since stopping the pill (in August)\\nProvera induced period on Nov.21 (less than 1 day after last pill)\\nLH 8.8\\nFSH 3.9\\nTotal Testosterone 67\\n(Taken at some random point in the cycle)\\n\\nThe nurse practitioner said that it is definately not PCOS but an OBGYN said that it could be. I am getting a second opinion. Does anyone know if this sounds like PCOS????? I am very scared. Thanks.\\n\\n-Nicole\\nHi, first of all, don\\'t be scared.  Stress is extremely detrimental to Women\\'s Health problems.  It could be PCOS, yes.  Like Blastoff said, you don\\'t have to have cysts.  She doesn\\'t and neither do I.\\n\\nI responded to your question in another thread.  You might talk to your doc about this.  An ob/gyn should know much more than a nurse practitioner about it.  Hormone levels can vary from woman to woman, so you need to consult a specialist.  I have the same levels as you, more or less, and I was diagnosed with PCOS.  However, I am looking into it possibly being something else, or at least trying different meds to just treat the symptoms, which seem to be my biggest problem.  I am also changing my eating habits. I have cut out all simple carbs.  You might try a change in diet.  You are at a healthy weight for your height, but only 50% of PCOS patients are overweight.  It IS an advantage to be at a healthy weight.\\n\\nJust one point:  it is not normal for a healthy woman of child-bearing age to not menstruate.  This is the main factor in your case, I think.  In fact, I have a fairly normal cycle, it\\'s just longer than more women I know, but my gyn diagnosed me with PCOS because of my symptoms.  In my case, I think weight loss will help a great deal, so I am focusing on that until I go back on androgen-blockers and estrogen.\\n\\nI hope this helps, Nicole!\\nTake care,\\nKatrina\\nHi, thanks again.  I read a thread in this forum (can\\'t tell you who wrote it, sorry) in which a woman tells how she got pregnant with fertility drugs after losing 40 lbs, then gained weight back, lost it again and got pregnant naturally.  Ah, I remember, she was talking about if it is possible to lose weight while on BCPs.  For her it was and subsequently got pregnant as desired.  That thread might help.\\n\\nI have never heard of Glucophage.  My glucose levels were normal the last time I checked them (last March).  My sister is on a weight loss medication, but she has a considerably greater amount to lose than I.  She also has PCOS and instead of taking hormones, she is only working on getting her weight down.  Thanks for the advice. I will look into Glucophage.\\nI was diagnosis with PCOS when I was 19 (10 years ago).  It was not until this year that I developed the token \\'string of pearls\\' cysts in my ovaries, though I have had many years of pelvic pain.\\n\\nFor the most part I have controlled a lot of the symptoms with Birth Control.  It controls your estrogen and testosterone and keeps you from ovulating (limits pelvic pain).\\n\\nHowever as I age BC gives me more and more headaches which is very uncomfortable.  So I am having to look at other meds.  My sugars are fine but the dr. has me on metformin to try to help control my testosterone.  For the first couple of months that made my cycts worse, but things have evened out now.  The metformin does help tremendously though with that low blood sugar feeling.\\n\\nI would consult an endocrinologist as well as your obgyn.\\nIs anybody still keeping up with this thread? I have elevated DHEA but normal insulin and blood sugar and my doctor wants to put me on glucophage. He says I have PCOS. Can it be diagnosed just from elevated DHEA?\\n\\nIf you read my post that is how I was DXed with PCOS,thought I did have other signs but the clincher was the elevated DHEA for me.  My all my other blood work came back prefect,even my cholesterol was prefect. The reason I mention that is simply because I am overweight and my doc was shocked that it was so low.\\n\\nYeah, I saw that but I was just concerned because he didn\\'t check for cysts on my ovaries. He didn\\'t do an ultrasound or anything. I had some excess hair, yeast infections and a little acne, and the elevated DHEA. I just thought he should check for the cysts or my body would show some other sign of insulin resistance in the blood work.\\n\\nI havent been checked for cysts either.  Not everyone with PCOS will have cysts so some doctors wont checkfor them simply because not everyone gets that problem.\\nhi everyone! i have PCOS. But i am not gaining weight, nor do i have facial hair or any other symptoms. Am taking the pill...would that help me regulate my periods after i stop taking them...',\n",

They have separate pills for the different side effects, but nothing to actually help the PCOS. Most often, they prescribe the birth control pill to go along with any medication given.\\n\\nThe best \"medication\" for PCOS is actually a healthy diet and exercise regime.\\n\\nThe possibility in having children is a more difficult one. If she gets her periods regulated and her hormones fairly straightened out, the possibility increases...however one of the more devastating side effects of PCOS is infertility. However, there is still the chance. Most likely you would have to go through doctor\\'s care, and even then not always. Both my grandmas had the symptoms of PCOs (irregular periods, etc.) yet they managed to have children.\\n\\nPCOS is a bad disorder, yet it isn\\'t terrible. It\\'s problem is mainly with the insulin levels, which effects the hormone levels. Just realize that she really has to keep a close tab on her weight, as the symptoms actually get mush worse the more overweight one becomes.\\n\\nHowever, i never really heard of migraines and stabbing stomach pains as being a side effect of PCOS. How long has she been taking the birth control pills? I had really bad side effects from all the birth control pills i have taken, including stomach pains and head aches, which is why I don\\'t take them =).\\n\\nAll in all, there isn\\'t alot out there on PCOS. It only effects about 5% of the women population, though it is believed that there are quite a few more, they just never got diagnosed. There are support groups trying to increase the research and they are hoping to come out with a pill that stabalizes the insulin levels. Yet, as far as I know, there isn\\'t a single pill which is used to help stabalize PCOS. Symptoms, yes, but the actual disease, no.\\n\\ngood luck =)\\n\\nta ta',\n",

       " {'post': 'To anyone who has been diagnosed with PCOS or has information regarding that diagnosis I would like to know exactly how that diagnosis is determined.  I\\'ve been reading up on it and am confused because the symptoms seem to vary so much.  For example some may have elevated hormone levels, some may not.  Some may have ovarian cysts, others may not.  Some people may or may not have excess hair, male pattern baldness, weight gain, acne, etc...  If some people have some of the symptoms and not others, or they vary from one person to the next, how do the doctors determine if you actually have PCOS?  Why can some individuals have elevated hormone levels (or any other main symptom of this syndrome) but not have PCOS while others may not have elevated hormone levels yet they do have PCOS?  It just seems so vague.  Like any doctor can just tell you that you have PCOS.  Are there specific tests I should request besides blood work to check testosterone levels, LH, insulin resistance, and ultrasound? What will they show?  How do doctors determine that it is PCOS and not something else?  Sorry for so many questions, it just seems to me to be diagnosed based on so many different variables.  Thanks for any information you can give me.\\nCris\\nWell for me all my hormone tests except one was normal.  My DHEA level wa outragoulsy high for someone in my age group.  That can be a indicator of PCOS.  I have one area in which I have hair lose,I also have weight gain even though I shouldnt,and facial hair. Also for a little while I was having some funky cycles.  That is how I was DXed for PCOS.  I dont knwo if I have cysts or not since my dr didnt bother to do an u/s.\\nIf you think you might have it then try to get your regular dr to give you a referral to a Endocrinologist.

She has been to two different endocrinologists due to beginning puberty at age 5.  Poor girl.  Her hormones just went crazy.  She was tested for adrenal hyperplasia which I read many people with PCOS have also been tested for.  She has a lot of the symptoms-elevated testosterone, weight gain, acne, stopped menstrating 7 months ago (she began having periods at age 10 and had been having them for about a year) no excess facial hair, but very hairy legs/arms to name a few.  I\\'m frustrated because I don\\'t understand why she wasn\\'t tested for this after they determined that she did not have adreanal hyperplasia.  Jeez, just five minutes of research on the internet and I could see that she has many of the symptoms.  Maybe they did not test her due to her age, but if she has all so many of the indicators then why not test her?  We\\'ve been struggling with this for 7 years now (four doctors)and still have no diagnosis.  Very frustrating.\\nAgain, thank you for the information.  Anything I can learn about this syndrome will be helpful.  We have an appointment to see her pediatrician in a couple of weeks.  We began seeing her in January.

You also mentioned that your DHEA levels where high for someone your age and that is why you were diagnosed. I pulled copies of my daughters lab results to see if they checked that on her.  Her DHEA level was 6.4 and it says it should be between 0.2-3.5.  So her levels are quite high there as well.  Her Androstenedione was 1.88, should be between 0.25-0.80, and Testosterone was 28 on one lab test and 42 on another, but should be less than 25.

It was horrifying to me.  The docs talked of doing a partial ovio-hysterectomy cause there were SO many cysts.    My mom said absolutely not!

       " {'post': \"I stopped taking Yasmin 2 months ago (after being on it for 3 years) due to horrible side effects- frequent urination, muscle pains, anxiety, vaginal dryness, etc. Since I have been off of Yasmin, I have felt horrible. Although most of those symptoms have improved, I am experiencing the following symptoms: severe hair loss (250-300 hairs per day) for 6 weeks, increased acne, increased facial hair (chin, mustache, etc) and NO PERIOD for 2 months. Prior to being on Yasmin, I did have some acne and some facial hair, however, I had never had hair loss from scalp. In fact, I probably had more hair than 3 people combined. However, since being on Yasmin I have noticed some hair loss, but since stopping Yasmin it has gotten significantly worse. I am so afraid that I am going bald. I saw my GYN and she told me the hairloss is from anxiety, however, after persuading her run hormone tests, noth my DHEA and testosterone are elevated. I am assuming this is what is causing my symptoms. Her nurse told me that I would be referred to a Endo. HOwever, after reviewing my hormone tests and past tests, the Endo's nurse told me that the Endo wants me to wait 6 months and have hormones re-tested. According to the nurse, the ENdo does not believe I have PCOS because I have no history of ovarian cysts (I had an ultrasound about 1 yeat ago and a CT scan this past May). However, can't you still have PCOS without cysts? This is the only Endo in my health plan and she is leaving in June. I have an appt with another GYN in July who I have heard is really good (both my mom and sister go to him) and a follow up derm appt in Aug (actually for my skin). I am so confused and frustrated. Whatever I have, I just want to treat it as soon as possible before it gets worse. Also, I am only 26 and would like to have children someday and hair when I get married. Woudn't an endo be the best person to diagnose or treat this? I have been severely depressed and anxious for the last few weeks and have been crying everyday. I can't eat and have difficulty making it through the entire day at work. This is affecting my relationship with my family and boyfriend. WHat should I do?\\nPCOS stands for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.  If you did not have cysts, you wouldn't have PCOS but rather some other hormonal condition that caused a similar set of symptoms.  But I agree that you should be seeing an endo to get to the bottom of your symptoms, and it's frustrating that they turned you away.\\nKay,\\nI know exactly what you are going through. I am 24, and was diagnosed with PCOS last November, but I think I've had this since my first years having periods. I have no cysts at all. So it is possible. My symptoms were increased acne, facial hair, receiting hairline, and absense of periods. (I think I've had 3 in the last year or so) My current doctor's specialty is Internal Medicine. He said they treat people with this as well as Endos. While I'm not happy with him right now, I think an internal med doc would be okay to see if you have more of them in your healthplan. He put me on 1000 mg of Glucophage per day in November. So far, my testosterone is only higher... which is one of the reasons I'm not happy with him. He's not being very aggressive in my treatment. But don't worry, you're not alone. And from what I've read, it is possible to have children with PCOS. You might have to take some fertility treatments, but it would be well worth it if you want kids. Let me know how things go. I'll keep ya in my thoughts.\\nSometimes just knowing you're not alone is a big help.\\n\\nActually Timber, you\\nhave PCOS with no cysts. It is a very strange syndrome and I don't think any 2 people have the same symptoms. But from everything I have read and heard from multiple doctors, the cysts are not necessarily present with all people who have it. Which, I think that is one of the main reasons it is commonly misdiagnosed.\",\n",

       " {'post': \"I had a blood test done by endocrinologist that showed high testosterone and DHEA (according to their lab ranges) and an ultrasound that showed several cysts on my ovaries-I've had 2 single cysts prev. incl. one measuring 2.5 in.  Neither my GP or endo seemed concerned, altho GP mentioned poss. PCOS.  From what I've read this could be serious.  Is it because of my age(22), or the fact that I'm not having any issues w/ symptoms?  I don't understand how I could have this and not have any other signs.  I have a son who was concieved from 1 unprotected time-my period is very regular-I don't have excess body hair or acne (some trouble spots occasionally, but that's from resting my face in my hands all the time)-weight is not much of a problem, what extra weight I do carry is from being so darn lazy and it's not significant-I also read PCOS can cause small breasts, which is the opposite of my prob.-and I have terrible PMS and cramps (doesn't that point to ovulation actually occurring?). It's the opposite of what I'm reading.  Can PCOS present this way?  Do I need to push the endo to find out if I have PCOS?\\nYes PCOS can be exactly like this.  There are skinny women who dont have a single sign of PCOS and can still have it. I have it and didnt have any problems until after I turned 26 and everything went down hill from there.  My first son who I had at 21 was conceived after six months of trying.  We have been trying for our third for over 2 years now and no luck.\\nPCOS is one of those things that tends to get worse with age.  Though some girls/women can have in their teens and early twenties but for the most part after the age of 25 is when most women find out they have it and when the symptoms start to kick in.\\nPCOS is also related to insulin resistance. Diet can help improve both. Have you looked at NIH's info? They provide links to many PCOS studies, etc: [url]http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ovariancysts.html[/url]\\n\\n______________\\n203/146/146 on the Fat Flush Plan for life and perky to the max\\n\\nI have PCOS, and i don't look like i should at all outwardly. I'm not overweight, my weight isn't even close to centered around my belly, not excess hair, just a touch of acne (from being a teenager, lol), and nothing else outwardly. My only obvious problem was that i didn't have periods. After eating low carb, i've started to regulate (yay), although i still don't think i'm ovulating...oh well, i have a few years before i have to worry about that. But yes, you could definitely have PCOS, as no one's symptoms are the same. Has your doctor checked your LH:FSH ratio? That was the deciding factor for me, because mine was way off...it's supposed to be about even, and mine was 17.3:6.4 . My LH is quite a bit higher than some ppl who have all of the symptoms!\",\n",

       " {'post': \"Hi, it's been almost a year since my last post! When I joined this board last summer, I was seeking answers to my non-stop vagainal bleeding and spotting(months at a time) and infertility. My DH and I have been TTC #1 for 2 years with no success. Recently, I was finally referred to a fertility doctor and he diagnosed me with PCOS. I already knew a lot about PCOS because of info I read on this board (thanks!) and recently I started on Metformin. The doctor said that Metformin would not help with the bleeding - but in some miraculous way, it stopped! The doctor also said that I might have increased prolactin, but I am still waiting on the results of the second blood test to confirm that. I read that this could also be a reason for my infertility. The good news it, we finally have a PLAN. The doctor mentioned IUI and I am all for trying anything that will get us PG soon! Since I have been diagnosed with PCOS - I have been doing a lot of research on the internet. I read on another board a lot of success stories with PCOS women who started taking Metformin and conceived in a very short period of time. Currently, I am on 1000mg a day ... any other comments/success stories out there?\\n\\nFaith,\\n\\nCongrats on atleast getting a plan and a diag. I have been on 1700mg a day and have noticed a difference in the way I feel. But no difference in my menses or so far trying to get Pg. We just had an ER on 5/3/04 and ET on 5/6/04 and no waiting for test day for +++++ on 5/17/04. We did get to 5wks pg in Jan but lost the baby. So here we are again. Good Luck to you.\\n\\nS\\nThanks for the reply and I am sorry to hear that you MC'd .. I am terrified of that happening, it must have been really hard to deal with. Do you think you MC'd because of PCOS? I heard that there is a higher chance for women with our condition. Let me know what you think .. thanks!\\nNo one will really ever know. As my RE said that he doesnt know if it was the passenger or the vehicle that had a problem. So we will never really know. But they do say that a healthy women usually has a 60% chance of miscarriage on their first pgcy. We will see.\\n\\nS\\nGood luck on the met. I have taken chlomid, injectables, met. and now I'm on to ovarian drilling. I didn't respond to any of the above. The met. has helped with hair growth and my skin cleared up, but nothing else. I can only take 1000mg a day or I get an upset stomach or heart burn. I really have pretty regular cycles, just not on an exact day of each month so that didn't really change. My Dr. said he usually continues met. through out a pg to reduce chances of MC. Did you keep taking it? Just wondering because PCOS does carry a higher rate of MC according to my DR.\\nbest wishes\\n\\nYes I was on the Met the whole time. It has helped me with hair, weight, and acne as well. Just wish it would help with regulating my period and the ultimate goal of carrying to full term.\\n\\nS\",\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi,\\nIs anyone familiar both of these conditions?  If so, can you recommend any books that can provide some good information?  My 12 yr old daughter was diagnosed with PCOS about a month ago, and \"early\" type 2 diabetes today.  There is so much information out there, it\\'s a little overwhelming.\\nThanks for your help.\\nCris\\nI had PCOS.. I say had because I had a hysterectomy last year. Did they tell you for sure that it was type 2? There is another condition called MODY, which is Mature Onset of Diabetes in Youth. Another thing to point out is that most women with PCOS are also insulin resistant. Once the condition is under control, blood sugars come under control also.\\n\\nIs she seeing a GP or an Endocrinologist? I would really recomend the latter as a GP really doesnt handle this enough to treat it the way it deserves. You might also want to get tests done for Thyroid function. All of this is a part of the Endocrine system so the Endo would be the one to work with on that too.\\n\\nWomen with PCOS tend to have problems with weight gain, hair growth on the face and chin, infertillity, etc. All of these are something that I would stay on top of so that you can head them off should they become an issue. I wish you the best\\nMommyof4,\\nHi, and thank you for the reply.  Yes, my daughter has been seeing a pediatric endocrinologist since she was 5 due to early onset of puberty.  Right now, we are for the most part working with the pediatrician.  I\\'m very comfortable with that because she herself has two children with type 1 diabetes.  Entirely different than type 2, I know but she is very up to date on both types.  She also has a 13 yr old niece just diagnosed (not by her) with PCOS, so she has been heavily researching that syndrome.\\nWe went through lots of testing before we got the PCOS diagnosis.  Originally they thought it could be congenital adrenal hyperplasia.  She has all the classic PCOS symptoms and a recent ultasound confirmed the ovarian cysts.  She was recently placed on BC pills to regulate her hormones, but we were told to stop those for awhile because she has been experiencing severe abdominal pain while taking them.  Once that subsides, we will begin diabetes medication. Not sure what, this is so new to me.  I\\'ve herard about Glucophage and Avandia.  I was so shocked when the doctor said type 2 diabetes, I didn\\'t ask which medication she would be placed on.  At least we got this diagnosis very early on.  I do hope we are able to get things under control through diet and exercise.  Sorry, I\\'m going on and on here.  Thank you so much for your reply.\\nBy the way, I have 4 children as well.  Daughter age 12, and three sons ages 9,8, and 4.  How old are your children?\\nCris',\n",

       " {'post': 'I just went to the doctor today and he diagnosed me with PCOS. I have been on the pill since I was 15, went off it when I was 23 because DH and I wanted to try to have a baby. Since then I have been so irregular and when I do have bleeding it is pretty much always brown blood. So doc put me on progesterone to get rid of anything that might be built up inside me, and also put me on Metformin, to hopefully help to stimulate my ovaries to ovulate.\\nMy question is, does anyone else have this and if so did you get pregnant and how long did it take?\\n\\nHe said he will have me take Metformin and if it looks like I am not having a period on my own by September, he will put me on Clomid to help me ovulate.\\nSo hopefully this will work!!!

He said that because I was on the pill that it was masking the symptoms of PCOS. He also said that more than likely I will need something to stimulate my body in order to get pregnant, and then when I don\\'t want to get pregnant I will be on the pill to keep everything regular and in check. I guess there could be worse things that could be wrong with me that is making me not get pregnant, right? Or is this pretty much the worse thing you can have? I really don\\'t know?\\n\\nSorry this is so long, any information on this topic would be greatly appreciated, I could do all the research in the world, but nothing compares to hearing other people\\'s stories about having it and going through it. Thank you so much for some replies!!!\\nHi Jenyfer, I made an earlier post about this - but to save you the trouble of sifting through all the different threads, I\\'ll just post a reply here. I was on the bcp for about 2 years my husband and I were dating and went off of it in July, 2002 when we got married. After that, my period never came back \"regularly\" and starting in December, I started to spot daily for over 4 months! I came to this site for help and found that no one had experienced anything similar. My regular family doctor subjected me to a whole bunch of blood tests, u/s, different drugs (back to the bcp, provera etc.) and nothing worked .. the bleeding continued. After a year, she FINALLY agreed to refer me to a fertility specialist who within a few months, diagnosed me with PCOS. I was also told that the bcp masked the symptoms and that it was hereditary. At the end of April of this year, I was put on metformin (500mg a day). By the next week, I doubled it up and took 2 x 500mg a day. I started to do some research on the internet and found that several women posted about getting pg while taking metformin - so I posted the same question on THIS board and did not get too many hits. Well, while I was waiting for any responses .. I started to feel like AF symptoms were coming. In short, it never came and I found out I was pregnant (after 2 years of TTC and taking metformin for just 2 weeks!!). I am now almost 10 weeks along and still praying to God that I continue to have a healthy baby/pregnancy. I hope this post has given you some hope .. best of luck to you!!\\nI know exactly what you are going through right now.  I too was diagnosed with PCOS last September.  I was put on metformin.  The metformin made me so sick that I stopped using it for a while.  Waited until a month ago and tried again.  I experienced the same sickness again but after a week it goes away.  My doctor had me start with 500mg and after a week add another 500mg and I was suppose to add yet another 500 but can\\'t stand to take that much. So for the past month I have been taking 2 500mg tablets a day.  I really was down about it too.  After doing some research I found that most women who have PCOS and are overweight(either a little or a lot) start loosing weight and can get pregnant within 3 months(provided they are BD around ovulation).  After being irregular for so long it will be hard to know when exactly you are ovulating and that\\'s why they say 3 months.  Well I don\\'t think the good lord wanted me to go through all the stress of figuring out when my ovulation is so my DH and I BD any chance we had(he\\'s an over the road truck driver so it wasn\\'t too often).  Anyway to make a long story short we must have at exactly the right time because after only being on metformin for a month I am now pregnant.  I go see the doctor for the first time in 2 weeks. I wish you the best of luck with TTC.  Baby dust for you!\\n\\nThank you ladies so much for your responses!!! I really appreciate it. It is nice to hear success from women who are going through the same thing you are.\\nSo Faith-How were you exactly diagnosed by your doctor that you have PCOS? All my doctor did was look at the blood work I had done and then the things I am experiencing with my body and periods. Last month I had brown spotting for about 3 weeks...it finally ended...and then a week later it started again. I can\\'t imagine having it for over 4 months!!! I didn\\'t think anything was wrong with me because my family doctor ran my bloodwork and said everything was normal and she said it could take up to a year to get regular again. I just thought what I have been going through for the past 10 months was just my body trying to get regular again. Most of the time when I thought I was having my period it would be light enough to only need a pantyliner. Sometimes it would be reddish but mostly it was brown. And yes he did say that by me being on the pill it was masking the fact that I had this. The doctor had me start with 500mg of Metformin and after a week add another 500mg, and he said that if I am not seeing a regular period by Sept. he wants me to come back in and he would put me on Clomid. But he said hopefully by Sept. I will be coming in for my first Ob appt!!! I sure hope so!!!\\n\\nDolphin-I wanted to ask you what were your symptoms from taking the Metformin? I just took one pill last night and during the night it gave me cramps like I was going to get diarria, then this morning it was the same way, I didn\\'t have diarria but loose stool. Then my stomach was crampy and gassy all this morning. The nurse at the doc\\'s office said after a few doses the symptoms should subside.\\nWell, sorry this was so long, I just really want to know more about this and I just wonder how does the doctor know that this is exactly what I have?\\nAnymore info from you ladies would be great!!! Thanks again and congratulations to both of you on your pregnancies!!! I pray that everything continues to go wonderfully for you!!!\\n\\nThe way I felt on metformin is the same way you described.  Except I got the diareha.  I found though that after the week of taking it that it subsided.  Also by taking after eating it helped tremendously.  Good Luck!\\n\\nYeah, I take it after I eat dinner. So hopefully it won\\'t get too bad. I am glad this is a long weekend coming up. Hopefully by Tuesday I won\\'t be feeling the symptoms too much more. A couple more questions for you...\\n\\nDid you get your blood checked regularly while taking it? Or did your doctor have plans too? And did he have plans to check to see if it was making you ovulate? Or did you just have to wait a couple months and if you weren\\'t pregnant by then, go back and see your doc? It seems like that is what my doctor wants me to do. If I am not pregnant within a few months then come back and he will put me on Clomid. Also he said he would want me to stay on it at least through my 1st trimester when I get pregnant, he said it is safe for the baby...just wondering if your doctor said anything about that?\\nThanks again!!!\\nI just hope this metformin works for me. My doc put me on progesterone too for 12 days to help rid of anything that my be built up inside me...he also told me to start the metformin at the same time...so does that mean we still keep ttc from this point on? Or do I wait until I see if the progesterone makes me get a period or something? Is it even possible to get pregnant yet? I am so confused...I pretty much am just waiting to see what happens I guess!\\nThanks again for that info!!!\\n\\nHi Jenyfer, to answer one of your earlier questions .. I has a series of blood tests and a couple of ultrasounds and the combined results showed that I had polycystic ovaries. In fact, they told me they could see it on my ovaries. The main problem I had was that I had no other PCOS symptoms (not overweight, no excess hair) but my fertility specialist said it explained my \"bleeding\". I pretty much wore a pantyliner every single day for the spotting. It never stopped and it never got heavier. As for the metformin, I have to say that I was VERY lucky in that I was one of those people that did not have an upset stomach at all from taking the medication. On April 15 of this year, I was also put on provera to clear up my system (\"fake\" period\") after what seemed to be a good, regular 7 day \"fake\" period (hope this is making sense) I was very disappointed that my bleeding/spotting came back after a few days. When my doctor put me on metofrmin at the end of April, I even asked him when i could expect the bleeding to stop - and he said that this medication won\\'t do that. Well to my happy surprise, it DID stop a few days after I started taking metformin. It was like a miracle. Before this, we couldn\\'t really try to conceive because of the constant bleeding - so to tell you the truth TTC wasn\\'t really on our minds. In early May, I did start to monitor my mucous and it seemed about right, so we BD\\'d on the Friday and Sunday .. and as it turns out, we conceived on the Sunday (Mother\\'s day!). So one of the most common questions you are asked a lot when you are pg is when was your last period - and for me, it was the provera (progesterone) induced period - so I never really know what to say. I also feel I should add that at the time we conceived, I have to say that I was probably in my best physical shape that i have been in a long time (regular weights and aerobic classes, 3-4 times a week) and I was also eating very healthy. I hope this has helped you a bit .. seems like your situation is very similar to what I went through. Good luck!\\n\\nMy situation does seem similar. So now that I am taking the progesterone to get a \"fake period\", do we still TTC while I am taking it? My doctor has me on it for 12 days and said I could have nothing, spotting, or a period about 3-4 days after the pills end. So my main question is...is it still possible to get pregnant during the 12 days of taking the progesterone? I am also taking the metformin at the same time. Or should I basically being TTC after the \"fake period\"? That is really what I am mostly confused by.\\nThe only difference between my situation and yours is that I am not in the best physical condition. I am 5\\'6\" and weigh about 200lbs. I planned on losing weight before getting pregnant, but that never happened. And now I want to get pregnant so badly that I don\\'t want to take months to try to lose weight. But supposedly the metformin helps you to lose some weight, and I am planning on going back to the gym I joined so maybe I will be able to shed a few pounds in the next month or so before I get pregnant...because I really want to work out and try to stay a bit in shape while I am pregnant...I don\\'t really need a whole lot of extra pounds added on during my pregnancy!!!\\nThanks again for your advice, I really appreciate it!!!\\n\\nHi Jenyfer, put it this way - it wouldn\\'t hurt to try right now - but from my own understanding and experience on this .. you would wait until after you finish taking the progesterone (provera?) and for you to have your \"fake period\" .. then use opk\\'s if necessary to determine when you are ovulating and go from there. I have read that some women will need metformin to be coupled with clomid before they can ovulate .. good luck!!\\nYeah, that is pretty much my understanding as well...was to wait until I finish the progesterone (also called prometrium on the box), until I start trying to get pregnant. My concern is that if there is a slight possibility that I do get pregnant while taking the progesterone then will it make me miscarry since it is suppose to make me have a period? But then the doc said that I may not have anything from taking it, meaning that I could get pregnant right? Like I said the whole progesterone thing is what is really confusing me right now. But thanks again for your advice, I really appreciate it!!!\\n',\n",

I'm still taking the Metformin and will throughout the entire pregnancy!!  Good luck to you!\\ni was just wondering; during my next visit to the doc, I plan on asking them about clomid. Is it a very expensive drug to buy if you have no medical insurance?\\n\\nIt isn't very expensive.  I believe it usually costs around $50.  Good luck!!\\nMetformin is an insulin sensitizer. For a lot of women with PCOS, one of the root causes may be problems with their body producing insulin, and not responding properly to it, therefore the average woman with insulin resistance (the medical term for this insulin problem) has quite a bit more insulin in her system than normal people do. What Metformin does is increase your body's ability to accept its own insulin, so that your hormones can begin to normalize. Another way to help is to go on a low carb diet, exercise regularly, and things like that, just to get the insulin to the proper levels. I'm not on any medication currently, but i got my periods because of my low sugar diet, exercising at curves (and doing ballet), and taking Omega-3 supplements. Hope this helps!\\nI was told i had pcos almost two years ago i was on metformin for six months trying to get pregnat but it was not untill i started taking clomid that i got pregnat, the first month. I lost it three months later but i am going to try again good luck, ask for clomid i really think that is what got me pregnat. Just make sure you doctor watches you, i had to get a vaginal sonagrame every two weeks.\\nMe and DH have been trying for a year now.  When we realized we couldn't do it naturally, my dr. did all the tests and put me on Provera and then Clomid (50mg) 5-9.  Well the Provera worked but then I didn't O on the Clomid, nor get a period.  So I went for more tests, seen a specialist and found out that I have PCOS.  So he told me to take the Provera again and Clomid (100mg this time), but with both meds I was to take metformin.  So I took the Metformin and Provera...waiting for menses.  The side effects were tolerable although once in a while I kind of get an upset stomache.  Once menses does come, I take the Clomid 100mg from 3-7.  I hope this works, I am very anxious and frustrated as I have been trying for a baby for about 5 years altogether (previous relationship).\\nWell tty girls later.

Looking back now on my adolescent years, i have always had the classic PCOS signs and it was never diagnosed. My endo put me on Metformin 500mg 1xday for 3 mo. In Feb. 2004, had bloodwork and results were better than before taking Met. Endo put me on 500mg. 2xday for 6 mo. Next appt. is Aug. 4th........ In March 2004, i began to have a period, my first since i was 14, by the way, i am now 33. I was so elated to just be having a period!!!!! April and May, had normal periods like clockwork. The first of June, during intercourse with DH, i had this horrible deep pain.... i had to stop it was so painful!! I have never had any pain during sex with DH for 12 years and this really scared me! During the next couple of days, i had bad cramps and felt like peeing all the time, so i go to family doc and was tested for UTI and all was normal. I was put on antibiotics anyway for fear of bacterial vaginosis. Took all of antibiotics and pain is mostly gone but i get a tinge every once in a while. So, in June.......NO PERIOD! I had all the cramps as usual but nothing has happened. Now it is July 11th and still no period. I cannot get in to see my Gyno until July 19th. This pain is really scaring me......any suggestions as to what this might be? Anyone else had this happen? Should i take a pregnancy test? We aren't really trying to get preg at this time. Sorry this was sooooooooo long.....thanks for reading, any replies appreciated................\\nsunnydawn33\\nAlthough I can't answer your questions, I would just like to let you know that I too am on the metformin same dose as yourself experience the same situation you are in with the pain, feeling of infection, taking the antibiotics and what not.  The only difference is that I never got a first period, that might be part of the reason as to why I'm having the pain.  My gyno appointment is july 15 only a few days before yours,  if noone else has any answers, I would be glad to update you when I have my appointment.  Anyway, reading your post was like reading my situation.  I haven't had any luck with a home pregnancy test myself but you think it is a possibility it would definately be worth buying one just to know.  Good luck!\\n\",\n",

       " {'post': \"I've been having problems keepin an erection while having sex with my G/F while wearing a condom, so earlier today we tried it without a condom, and it was MUCH MUCH MUCH better. Now I admit it was quite stupid not wearing a condom, and I know the pull out method isn't guarnteed, BUT, she has PCOS, and I was wondering if it was at all possible for her to get pregnant, and if so what would the % be?\\nI would not let a diagnosis of PCOS prevent me from using protection.  Her doctor would be the best one to determine her chances of getting pregnant.  If she ovulates, she can get pregnant, though the risks of miscarriage are high.  (I hope you would not want to put her through that.)\\n\\nNot being able to orgasm due to condoms is generally psychological.  I discourage you from avoiding protection and would instead urge you to stop masturbating and learn how to ejaculate with condoms.  You admit to what you are doing as being stupid, so I would advise you to start doing the wise thing.\\nJust because she has PCOS doesnt mean she cant get pregnant.  Yes PCOS can effect fertility but it isnt so with all women. Also the younger the woman is with PCOS the less chances of it effecting her fertility.  Though it has been mentioned she is at a higher risk of miscarriage and really you dont want her going through that emotional roller coaster.\\n\\nYou have to just learn to accept the condoms and learn how to get comfortable with them. A good way to go is have her help put them on to try to help things along.\\nYea, as I said we tried it once, and while we both enjoyed it much more then with condoms, after a long talk we both decided that it would be better not to risk anything and just play it safe. Only problem, is 1.) I dont masturbate much at all and 2.) sex with a condom still isnt very enjoyable.\\nGet her on the pill, then you don't really need a condom so long as there is no risk of any STD's\\nIn order for the pill to work she has to be able to have her period, and she cant get hers.\\nActually Sheresh the pill is used with PCOS girls/women to help control the cysts that can occur with PCOS.  She might want to change doctors so she can get proper care for for PCOS.  Granted PCOS cant be gotten rid of but it she can be on the pill to control things.  She doesnt have to have a period to be on it.  The reason most want a period to come before the pill is started is so they know that sheisnt pregnant and can start the pill either during or right after her period.  But with PCOS it can be iffy on when a period will come so some doctors who are knowledgable about PCOS will have the girl/woman start the pill after a pregnancy test is done.\\nAlso just because a girl/woman is on the pill doesnt mean they are protected.  BC pills just like any other BC can fail,so if by chance she does go on the pill make sure to continue to use condoms just to be on the safe side.  You two need to sit down and talk about this.  Discuss your options and what you both want to do if she does wind up pregnant from this.  IF she doesnt then you can remember the conversation and hence have a plan for the what ifs that might occur.\",\n",

And I feel like vomiting whenever I eat a small amount of food(even though I might still be hungry).\\n\\n-Dry mouth, lack of saliva.\\n\\n-Fatigue, sometimes I feel I have no energy at all. My heart sometimes pounds really hard and fast for no reason.\\n\\n-diarhea\\n\\n-hot breath (the kind of breath you feel when you have a fever)\\n\\n-small headaches\\n\\n-lack of sweat(even when playing sports), but sometimes when I wake up in the middle of the night I am quite sweaty.\\n\\n-just a general feeling of sickness most of the time.\\n\\nThis has been going on for several years now. I don\\'t know if all these symptoms are related or not, but if anyone can help, thank you.\\n\\n[This message has been edited by r_c_dragon (edited 09-17-2001).]\\nThe most common causes of losing all the hair on your body is a hormone imbalance.  Either:\\n\\nthyroid disorder (hair loss occurs in both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism)\\n\\nsex hormone imbalance\\n\\npituitary problem\\n\\nMany of your other symptoms are also associated with these disorders.  Sometimes its hard to diagnose which hormone/hormones are causing the problems.  Your best bet is to see the best Endocrinologist in your area.\\n\\nI agree with all the above suggestion and also look into Illitis/colitius.  Causes many of the above symptoms as well as loss of weight.  No cure only have to learn how to live with it.  it works in a way that you body is allergic to many foods. (for expample I am allergis to bread, fish, milk, corn and, green vegtables)  I eat a lot of Red Meat and Potatoes.  Each person reacts differntly.  Uncontrolled it could cause body systems to shut down for no reason.  Treatment is steriods or surgery to remove the diseased area of intestines.  I learn to live with it and when a flare-up strikes I go directly to bed until is goes away.  Usually goes away in 1 day or so.(sleep is the best help) When a major flare-up occurs you must go to the hospital to be refortified. The systems of you body are starving for nurishment.\\n\\nGood Luck,\\n\\nOliver\\nAsk a doctor to run tests for non-tropical sprue--celiac sprue.

But my pulse was 98, 95 (respectively).\\n\\nThis doesn't seem right to me...any ideas?\\n\\nThanks.\\nBlood pressure is a measurement of the force applied against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps blood through the body. The pressure is determined by the force and amount of blood pumped and the size and flexibility of the arteries.\\n\\nYour pulse is different.  It measures 4 things:\\n1) the number of times your heart beats per minute.\\n2) the rythym of the heart\\n3) the strength of the beat\\n4) the hardness/softness of the arteries\\n\\nYour blood pressure isn't low.  It's considered low when 2 things occur:\\n1) it's below 90/60\\n2) if blood pressure changes from the baseline or normal condition. A fall of 30 mmHg or more from a person's normal baseline is considered low blood pressure.\\n\\nA normal pulse range is 60 to 80 beats per minute while at rest.  It changes constantly with the amount of activity, both mental and physical. A sustained pulse at over or near 100 at rest is considered to be tachycardia.\\n\\n\\nMy blood pressure is usually 107/60. Sometimes it's 98/57 and my pulse will be around 88 or something.

I try to keep my hair very clean.. take care of my hair.. take showers everyday.. I just don't know.\\n\\n&gt;What did the Dr tell you they were?\\nI went to the family doctor, he isn't a skin specialist but he just said they are due to sweating and that anti-biotics would cure it.  Also to note, I went to him like 3 months ago as well, he told me the same thing and gaved me a supply of anti-biotics and sent me home..\\n\\nHowever, because I don't recall myself sweating in the last 4 or 5 days and thus, I am very puzzled to the fact why it happens.\\n\\nFurther information I can give you if you ask or if i forgot to include it in here.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou don't say how old you are but I'm going to guess less than or around 18\\n\\nI sounds like a form of acne.  I'm not positive about this tho. If you are given anitbiotic therapy, it is a long term thing.  What I mean is, you would have to continually take it for it to have an effect.  Even then it would not cure it or maybe not even stop it.  It would just keep if from being so bad.\\n\\nI would see a dermatoligist.  He could accurately diagnose this.  Sorry I couldn't be more help.\\n\\nHrmm..\\n\\nThen my question would be, .. would anti-biotics even help at all ?? i mean.. if you give your body too much of anything, it will stop to respond ..\\n\\nI just went to another doctor.  He said to make a appointment with a dermatoligist as well.\\n\\nSorry to say that i could not meet your age expectation.. i am around 21 but totally unknown to the facts of medicines and so forth.  I just pray to God to do away to disease\\n\\n\\nYes antibiotics can help reduce acne symptoms alot.  The usual ones are tetracycline and erythromycin.  They're usually used when infection is present or in a severe case.   Other treatments include:\\n\\nTopical medications that dry up the oil and/or promote skin peeling may contain benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, salicylic acid or tretinoin, or retinoic acid (Retin-A).  These kind of suck tho if it's in your hair.\\n\\nAntibiotics may be prescribed if the skin lesions appear infected. Topical antibiotics (applied to a localized area of the skin) such as clindamycin or erythromycin are also used to control infection.\\n\\nSynthetic vitamin A analogues (isotretinoin, Accutane) have been shown to be of benefit in the treatment of severe acne. However, pregnant women and sexually active adolescent females should not take this medication!\\n\\nOther medications may include topical or injected forms of cortisone.\\n\\nGood luck at the dermatoligist.  Let's hope it's something real easy to cure\\nLet me know if you can, as I'd like to have the information for future reference.\\n\\n\\nThanks.

And what are some examples of medications that have such strict instructions?\\nTaking medicine on time every day replaces the medicine that your body has used up since the last dose. Taking medicine on time keeps a steady level of the drug in the body. All medicines have what they call a half-life.  In pharmacology, the half-life is the time required by the body, tissue, or organ to metabolize or inactivate half the amount of a substance taken in. This is an important consideration in determining the proper amount and frequency of dose of drug to be administered.\\n\\nMostly it is medicines that help keep you alive that it\\'s imperative to take on time such as medicine for seizures, asthma, diabetes, heart medications, birth control pills (for obvious reasons)etc.\\n\\n',\n",

       " {'post': \"I was recently diagnosed with PCOS, and my doctor sent me to get a pelvic ultrasound.  The ultrasound revealed a 14 cm cyst on my left ovary.  My bloodwork had shown that I had an imbalance in my LH and FSH levels (my estrogen and progesterone levels were normal).  I was sent to get a CT scan, and further bloodwork.  The bloodwork and CT scan showed that the cyst was an endometrioma and that I also had endometriosis.  I also found out that I have a small tumor on my pituitary gland causing increased levels of prolactin...for what that's worth.\\n\\nMy GYN did several pelvic exams over the next few weeks, and could feel the cyst on the left side, putting pressure on everything and all that stuff.   She scheduled me for surgery, given the size of the cyst and the fact that it has been causing me a lot of pain (on the left side of my abdomen, I might add).  As a final test, she sent me to get an MRI.\\n\\nNow, when I went in for my pre-op today, she told me that the MRI showed that there is nothing but a 1 cm cyst on my left ovary, and that the problem is a 10 cm fibroid on the top of my uterus, towards the right.\\n\\nWhat the heck?!?  I mean, really?  How can I go from having a 14 cm left ovarian cyst diagnosed by pelvic exams, an ultrasound, bloodwork and a CT scan, to having a 10 cm uterine fibroid to the right, which none of the other tests had detected?  I've read that most fibroids occur in women in their late 30's and beyond...I'm 28.  Is there any chance the MRI could be wrong?  My GYN can't understand the change, and said she is only going to know for certain what is going on when she actually does the surgery.\\n\\nJust wondering if anyone has any thoughts on this strange situation, or has had a similar changing diagnosis?\\nSabriste,\\n\\nI have a feeling that the ultrasound and the MRI were both visualizing the same thing !  The top of your uterus (assuming they mean outside) and your ovary area are around the same place.  I know on the chart it looks obvious but in actual fact, everything is close together in there and your ovaries are near the top of your uterus.  There is a possibility that the angle from where they were seeing things differed in each test and so the location on the report differed as a result.  Whether it be 10 cms or 14 cms, this is still a large growth and it should definitely be taken out.  The difference in dimensions may also be due to the different type of test done.  There is a lot of variation when they are measuring these things and depending on the angle, the type of machine, the person doing the test etc.. these can all have an effect on the final result of the report.  For cysts and growths of this nature, I would have a tendency to trust the ultrasound more than the MRI.  It is supposed to be more of the gold standard for these types of things as it is better able to see the composition of the growth.  The MRI can sometimes actually give too much information (!) which is difficult to interpret (kind of like finding a red scarf in a huge crowd of people).\\n\\nThe surgery will be the ultimate confirmation of what is there and where because once the surgeon is in there, there can be no doubt of what it is, a cyst or a fibroid and where it is located.  If you want to put your mind at ease, you may consider popping in for a final ultrasound before surgery and seeing if this can make a definitive decision as to where the growth actually is.  Sometimes ovarian cysts that are diagnosed on ultrasound will actually be located within the fallopian tube and not within the ovary.  It is very difficult to actually visualize things sometimes, especially if the location is a bit unusual.  You may consider having a transvaginal ultrasound instead of an external one as this will enable a closer look at the growth.\\n\\nAs for the 1 cm cyst that is on your ovary, this is most likely a normal functional cyst that we women get with ovulation every month.  It is strange that you were diagnosed with PCOS and you don't have the standard necklace pattern of ovarian cysts that most women have.  Have they considered that perhaps you DON'T have PCOS and the that the LH and FSH are out of whack because of the growth on your pituitary gland ?  This would seem to make more sense to me.  Hopefully they are tackling this other issue as well.  An MRI in this part of the body would definitely be a good idea in order to see where the growth on the pituitary is actually located.  Might they be able to shrink it without surgery ?\\n\\nI am sure that everything will go well with the surgery.  Hang in there and think about how relieved you will be after the procedure, knowing you don't have to think about ultrasounds or cysts or growths or all of that stuff and you can go back to living a normal life as before.  Come back and tell us how things are progressing.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nEstria\\nHey Sabriste,\\n\\nHere's a thought.  I know that some uterine fibroids can actually grow on a stalk outside of the uterus.  If this is your case, this would account for the fibroid being mistaken for an ovarian cyst AND for its change in position (if it's on a stalk, there could be some movement, especially given its size).  You may want to discuss this with your doctor as a possibility.  This type of uterine fibroid is not uncommon and given your strange scan results, very likely.\\n\\nHope this helps.\\n\\nEstria\",\n",

       " {'post': 'I\\'ve pondered whether or not I have PCOS for about the last 10 years.  I was on the pill for 7 years, and then after getting married 11 years ago went off it.  I didn\\'t have my period for a year.  Doctors tried to jump start them, with no luck.  I tried to get pregnant, and after getting my cycles going with Black Cohosh, I lost my first baby at 25 weeks, and no cause was found.  My placenta just detached with no cause for it.\\n\\nAfter losing about 20 lbs and charting for 9 months and exercising, eating well, etc.  got pregnant again.  All went great, kept up exercise and eating well all through the pregnancy.  Had a healthy baby girl.  But, a few years later, then I started having really painful episodes right before I got my period.  My period has always been irregular.  Skipping months, spotting, etc.  The day before I would start my flow, I would get a pain around one of my ovaries(they would alternate.) and it would increase in intensity until it got so bad, all I could do was lay down on the bed and pop some ibuprophen until the pain subsided.  My daughter was about 2 then, and we had talked about having another child. We were trying to conceive with no luck.  I had gained 30 lbs since originally going off the pill, and had started growing noticeable hair on my chin since then, too.\\n\\nMy doctor thought I had endometriosis, and that was causing the pain.  But, before I could have the laproscopy to verify it, I found out I was pregnant with daughter #2.  So I never found out if I had it or not.  My blood sugar was a little high while pregnant, but not high enough to be diagnosed with gestational diabetes.  I have now gained a total of 40 lbs since going off the pill 11 years ago.  I\\'m not obese, but I\\'m close.  I\\'m 5\\'5\" and 182, with most weight at my waist.  No pain with my cycles.  But, I still have the facial hair and losing weight is very hard, I have a constant appetite that doesn\\'t go away, no energy.  And still the irregular periods and facial hair.  I was going to have blood tests done to see if I have PCOS as I wanted to go back on the pill anyway, and I figured I might be killing 2 birds with one stone if I do have it.\\n\\nAnyone have any insight if that could be what is causing the irregular periods and facial hair, and possibly the extra weight?  And I also have constant break outs on my face and back.  I didn\\'t have any of these things on the pill.  And I have issues with hypoglycemia-I have to eat regularly or I get light headed and get the shakes.\\n\\nI appreciate any info.\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\nD\\nI just wanted to say when i talked to my doctor and brought up the hair growth he said if i had mentioned that alone he would have tested for PCOS. I went in cause another doctor thought that was the problem with me. I would deff make an apt with your gyn and have them do the tests. better to know then not. It is possible\\nThanks, Chatterbox.  That\\'s pretty much what I thought.  The fact that the pain I had experience before was where my ovaries were, and not my uterus makes me think I might have had cysts and not known it.  I did have an internal ultrasound before I was scheduled for the lap, but if they weren\\'t looking at my ovaries, then they wouldn\\'t have seen anything.  It seemed they were focused on my uterus.\\n\\nI see a nurse practitioner, not a gyn.  Do you think that matters?  The closest gyn is 30 minutes away, which is not a big deal.  But, I think they might only have male docs there.\\n\\nI go to see my np in 2 weeks, so at the worst she would have to refer me, I guess.  I live in the boonies, so any specialist you have to drive an hour to see.\\n\\nIf anyone else has any comments, info, please feel free to share.\\n\\nThanks!\\nYou can go to your normal doctor and let them know what you think. They may be able to do what you need. I know i had a few blood tests done. I am in a small town and my gyn is 45 mins from here. Worse case your doctor will say you need to go to the gyn and can refer you i would think. Just let your doctor know what your worried about if they ignore what your saying then just go to the other doctor for another opinion.\\n\\ngood luck\\nI actually stumbled across a good article about PCOS, and pretty much sounds like most of the stuff I need done would be easier to just go to an endocrinologist and have them do all the tests in one place, so they don\\'t have to get results from my clinic, etc.   The RN said pretty much not to bother your physician with it, all they might be able to do is say \"that sounds like you have PCOS.\" I am near the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN-which is like THE place to go for a lot of stuff.  So, I put in a request to get an appointment there.  Their site said they usually have a diagnosis in a couple days, so hopefully I can get in soon.   They have, like, 20 endocrinologists there.  It\\'s crazy.  I wouldn\\'t even know who to go to, so maybe there\\'s one of them that specializes in PCOS and they\\'ll have me see them.\\n\\nWe\\'ve been having trouble with our docs here, misdiagnosing things.  All the good docs have retired, so we only go with the check ups and then leave the more serious stuff to the big city specialists.  They totally missed my poor DH having an infection and didn\\'t give him antibiotics, put him on something for an enlarged prostate instead, and so he had this infection for weeks before a specialist just looked at his chart, knew he had an infection, and prescribed the antibiotics.  So this is why I feel the way I do about our docs.\\nOkay, well-I got all my test results back, and they were all within normal range.  Testosterone, FSH, LH-everything.  So, no PCOS.\\n\\nIs there anything else that would cause me to not ovulate?  Can being overweight/obese, stress, being anemic, cause anovulation?\\n\\nI am concerned about the effects of not ovulating and having a period, like endometrial cancer.\\n\\nAny info would be very helpful.\\n\\nI am going back in next week to go over the test results.\\n\\nI have low iron(small red blood cells), and high cholesterol(251).  Nothing else to report, really.  Which I guess is good.\\n\\nThank you!\\n\\nHello,\\nI was just faced with possibly having POS this last month or so and was going through the very same thing you are.  Not necessarily missing cycles but clotting bit clotts, and acne, anxiety not being able to take a deep breath, tired, yawning all the time.  I do know from a lot of research that I have done that your cycle, the hair, the eating, all has to do with your hormones.  PCOS plays a big role in controlling our hormones as females.  Due to the pancrease pumping the insulin through our bodies it has to work harder when we have PCOS.  Insulin is what helps to contribute the hormones in our body to help eveything operate as normal.  They have put me on metformin and I had been on it for 3 weeks 500mg once a day. And was feeling sick nausea, tired, feeling like I\\'m going to pass out; anxiety symptoms like I couldn\\'t take a deep breath just too much.  These are also some symptoms I was having prior to taking the medicine. So my doctor told me to stop taking it for a couple weeks and see how I feel.  Well I did and I felt horrible.  Now this is the second day taking the lower dose and finally starting to feel like a normal person.  It\\'s amazing how much influence our hormones play a role in controlling the actions anf functions of our body.  My sinus\\'s is even starting to clear up without medicine.  You may want to ask your doctor about this med.  Now I\\'m taking 250 mg once a day and then I\\'m working out and eating better.  I think you may have had PCOS while taking your pills before b/c they prescibe birth control as well to help with PCOS.  You may want to check into this.',\n",

I was hoping to talk to someone that has actually tried it.\\n\\nI'm open to the idea of the hysterectomy (I have two boys and don't plan on ever having anymore) but I would really rather try all that I can before I resort to surgery. Any help or suggestions is greatly appreciated!!\\nHi,\\n\\nSorry to hear about your troubles!  Being resistant to all of the medication myself, I can definitely sympathize with you.  But, if I were you, I might seek at least one other opinion before going with the hysterectomy.\\n\\nI am not sure which over-the-counter vitamins you are referring to, but having taken a cocktail of over-the-counter vitamins/herbal supplements myself for just over 16 months now, I can tell you, for me they are doing nothing.  My hair loss, hirsutism, and painful periods were not really impacted at all by these things.  My acne is somewhat less, but that might just be hopeful thinking.\\n\\nThe thing is, it has been 5 years since I've gotten the nerve to go back to the doctor to try different options.  The first round of experiences did not go well, largely due to the Metformin making me sick as well (and I am convinced it left permanent 'damage' but that's another story).  But, I know, even 5 years ago, my doctors were giving me different drug options.  When one failed to help me, I went to another one.  I got farther with some of them than with others, and they each (all four) had a different approach.  Ultimately, I just never stuck with it, since I had little patience to deal, and my white-coat phobia ultimately got the best of me.\\n\\nNever, in that course of treatment, however, did anyone suggest a hysterectomy as a viable option.  Granted, I was sixteen when I was diagnosed, and twenty when I finally gave up and decided to just deal with the symptoms on my own.  But, just because you are in your late-30's does not necessarily mean you should have to go through that or just deal with it.  Even with your high blood pressure, someone should be able to figure out something.  Has your doctor ever mentioned Spironolactone?  I was allergic to it, but in the month that I was taking it before I broke out into hives, I thought I was seeing a slight decrease in facial hair...\\n\\nYou can try the over-the-counter stuff, but, seriously, if you are willing and able, I suggest seeking out a second (or even third or fourth) opinion.  If you do decide to go with the hysterectomy, let it be on your own terms.  Research life after a hysterectomy, the possible complications, and be educated on it.  Don't go through with it just because you that it might be your only way to PCOS symptom relief.\\n\\nGood luck!\",\n",

Before I got to that dose I was on Metformin 500mg twice daily, that dosage my body couldn\\'t handle. I was very nauseated to the point of not eating for several days. I also remember the back pain. I am not a doctor, but it sounds like the dosage is too high. If she is in that much misery, TAKE HER TO THE ER!! They can do blood work and get immediate results. If she is having an allergic reaction to the meds, they can help her. I was on the 500mg 2x daily dose for about 2 days when I started having adverse symptoms, I was on 500mg once daily for 2 weeks prior to the upage. My dr said that my body cannot tolerate the full blow of the medication, that is why she put me on the extended release. I have no adverse symptoms now. Best wishes, I will be praying for your girlfriend and you.\\nthanks alot for your information. she went to see the doctor , the doctor didnt say anything but just to ask her to eat more calcium and vitamin.\\n\\ni\\'ve read a article about Metformin vs Metformin ER at diabetesupdate blog.  It seems that ER will take the effect slowly, that\\'s the only difference, right? but i read that it still will cause some minor side effect (as long as u taking Metformin) such as having to get up to pee at night , gas after taking metformin..\\nwhat\\'s your experience on Metformin? by the way, you suffering from PCOS too?\\nI don\\'t have to get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. I haven\\'t had any problems with gas, that is uncomfortable or anything. My experience with it has been good, with the exception of getting too much at the beginning. It has helped regualte my cycles to where I can know an aproximate start date, usually within a week. I am starting to have some problems with low blood sugars, and am going to the dr for that in a few weeks. I really can\\'t imagine my life without Met.\\nThe ER is released slower, which is why I can tolerate a higher dose. That is the only difference that I know of.\\nWhat kind of doctor did she see? It sounds pretty odd that they just want her to up her calcium and vitamins. If she is not seeing an OBGYN or a dr who knows about PCOS, I highly suggest finding one. I am blessed that my OBGYN is very knowledgeable about PCOS. I like her so much, that I am still seeing her even though I don\\'t have insurance. It is worth the money to see a dr you are comfortable with and who you can trust. She might also want to get a second opinion. I hope this helps.\\n\\nthanks.\\nyour help and suggestion is much appreciated.\\nyeah, maybe we should try to see another more experienced doctor. The doctor is obgyn but i still cant trust her 100% since she seems do not really giving a clear explanation or checkup for my girlfriend. finding a good doctor is always depend on luck.\\n\\nbut these few days, she seems better already, just losing some appetite to eat.  but my girlfriend is not fat and i believe no diabetes. i afraid the met will just make her getting thinner and thinner.\\nmaybe i should ask her to ask the doctor about met ER next time she visit.\\n\\nbesides, do you eat any supplement food, vitamins? or any particular food or fruits are good for PCOS? just cant stop taking care of her.\\n\\nI eat what I want. I do try to eat more proteins and less sweets, but that is just how I am. I also take a multi-vitamin/mineral that is formulated for women, along with extra calcium and vitamin d to help with bone growth (I broke my foot last month). Generally speaking, one of the side effects of met is weight gain. I haven\\'t had a major problem with gaining weight, maybe 5-10 lbs total since I started it. As long as your girlfriend eats balanced meals, and keeps a lot of the fats, sweets, and carbs in small portions the weight gain is less likely. I try to eat fresh fruits and veggies, or steam them. The healthier the diet, the less likely the pounds will come on.\\nFor finding another dr, ask friends who they see. Look online for drs specializing with PCOS in your area. Call and ask different offices if there is a dr there that would be willing to look at your GFs case. It sucks having to do the leg work yourself, but that is the best way to find a good dr. You can also call your insurance company and see who they recomend. I am sure that your GF appreciates what you have been doing for her, that takes a good man to do it. Keep it up, and you both will see great results.\\nI wish you the best with this journey.\\nyeah, hope she will appreciate.\\nagain, thanks for your time and helps.\\ni will post if any update\\n\\nby the way, i have a question.\\nHow long does will the metformin last in body?\\nnow, she\\'s taking it every 6 hours after meal. is it ok?\\nIt depends on how it is prescribed. I take mine at night before I go to bed. I don\\'t eat with it, when I did eat with it I would get the shakes and a upset stomach. I do much better by just taking at night. And I am on the extended release so it is supposed to last til the next dose. As long as she is taking it as prescribed it should remain in her system. I have missed a day or two from illness and felt different, but that went away when I started up again.\\nI have pcos and am prescribed metformin i have all the same symptoms so i stopped taken it my doctor is mad an says keep taken it but i cant stand to feel any worse than i already do.',\n",

       " {'post': 'I\\'m 16 and I found out I have pcos around the beginning of this year. I\\'ve been on metformin since about april. I started out with 500 mg a day then I went to 1000mg, but about two weeks ago I started taking 2000mg a day. My doctor said this is the most she can prescribe me a day. I\\'m 5\"4 and 122 lbs. and excercise regularly. I\\'ve never had my period, but my doctor is trying to start it. Does anyone know what will happen next if I don\\'t have my period by the next time I go to my doctor? If there\\'s anything else that I can do to start my period?\\nWhy did your doctor put you on metformin to start your period?  It\\'s a diabetic drug to assist with insulin stabilisation.  It\\'s usually given to women with PCOS to assist in stabilising insulin to assist in weight loss.  You are at a healthy weight so I don\\'t see why you need it.\\n\\nThere\\'s a couple of things you can do.  First of all, you can look at your diet.  A diet high in starchy carbs (sugar, bread, wheat, potato, rice, pasta, etc) can create problems if you have insulin resistence as the body reads all these things as basically sugar.  You can try removing them for a while and see if there\\'s any effect.  I\\'d suggest at least 2 months to allow the body time to adjust.\\n\\nYou can also think about going to a naturopath or Traditional Chinese doctor to see about some alternative treatments.  We have an acupuncturist near us who has had extremely good results helping women with fertility issues.\\n\\nAnother thing you can do is go on the pill.   This will create an artificial regular period for you, which is fine for now, but you will need to look into fertility later on if/when you decide you want children.\\nMetformin isn\\'t working for me either. I\\'m 142 pounds, sometimes I skip a pill a few days but then I take one every day after that. Metformin was also causing my arms to be sore (but I read some of its side effects is muscle pain). Is my weight normal enough to not take Metformin? As of right now, it\\'s not bringing my periods at all.\\nAlthough Met is used in diabetic patients, it is used for women with PCOS because it it helps lower the insulin, testosterone and glucose levels.\\n\\nPCOS gives us a higher testosterone level then most and it should help over time.  Also, know that a very high percentage of PCOS women will become insulin resistance, so the metformin will help with that.\\n\\nAs for the period.. that is something that can be confusing.  I was diagnosed with PCOS at age 13.  My periods were on and off.. and then I never had one for years. THis is common.  Some women will have normal, some will have very irregular and some will have none at all.\\n\\nThere is nothing you can do to speed it up, but birth control can help you regulate them.  Birth control let me have a normal period every month for a long time.\\n\\nBut metformin has a lot of benefits with women with PCOS.  It can hard on the stomach, but I have been on it for years.  So have many other girls I know with PCOS.  It also helps a lot have children later on in life.',\n",

I was diagnosed with PCOS back in 2000.  I'd never heard of the disease.  As many times as I went to a GYN or even my regular doctor for the craziness of my periods, NOBODY DIAGNOSED IT until then.  My doctor listed all the symptoms of PCOS, hirsutism (the hair thing), amenorrhea (the bleeding/not bleeding thing) depression, acne, weight.  I was shocked that no other doctor had put it together before.  I started on the birth control pill, which was great because it forced periods.  But when we wanted to have a baby, I was anxious.  I was overweight, still not ovulating.  My doctor insisted we could do it.  I took glucophage (or metformin) for a long time hoping that things would normalize. The periods did get normal,  I DID lose some weight, but a year or two went by, Nothing.  In 2004, we decided to stop trying to conceive without help.  My doctor decided to start me on a course of Clomid, a fertility drug.  I conceived in the first 90 days of taking it.  I still had problems with the pregnancy, incompetent cervix (which I don't believe is related to pCOS, but am curious to see if anyone else with the disease has suffered the same) which caused preterm labor.  I had forced bedrest.  After not being allowed to exercise for a month,  developed gestational diabetes, and my son was born at 28 weeks, that's 12 weeks too soon.  We knew he would be early so the doctors had given me steroid injections to help his lungs develop more rapidly.  He is a miracle.  There's more to his story, but I'm giving you mine.  I have a son.  He is everything.  We want to have another child, and we're going to try again.  I am older, it will be harder, but I have HOPE.  So should you.\\n\\nawwww\\nthank you i hope hes doing good now\\nits finally nice to read that it happened for some people ( even if he was early\\nhe was still ok\\n) iv been on metformin about a week and half now we on the other hand are thinking of giving up now we are happy together so children or no children we will still want to be with each other its getting less and less important because its just not happening. but where going to give it 5 - 6 months then stop trying we have been trying for a long enough\\n\\nHappy Ending...my sister has had PCOS as long as I can remember and she is younger than me.

A good tool that I would recommend would be an ovulation tester.  The one I used was called the Lady Free Bio Tester and there is another one called Maybe Baby.  They were a big help in finding out when I was ovulating as I had not pattern at all, after using this I was pregnant in about 6 months.    Good luck, I know how hard it is when everyone else around you seems to fall pregnant so easily and you think it will never happen to you.  I think I had actually given up on getting pregnant and put it out of my mind and started planning overseas holidays.  Once I became at peace with myself that maybe it wasn't meant to be I had actually fallen pregnant.  I now have three beautiful kids.

I am in absolutely NO way okay with any sort of internal pelvic exam. I\\'m over 18 and I have never been sexually active. Will a gynecologist treat me even if he can only look at my ultrasound results/blood work/external exam? Is a pelvic exam always necessary? I\\'m sick with worry over seeing this doctor, but I know I need to go.\\nWhen was the ultrasound done? And did they tell you or did the report give the type of cyst? 1.8cm is small and most cysts resolve on their own after 2 to 3 cycles. So if your u/s was done recently and the cyst was not suspicious looking then you shouldn\\'t need another u/s for a few months.\\n\\nI have a fear of all things medical because I was over-treated for an ovarian cyst. But in my case it was large (9.5cn) and probably would have never gone away on its own plus it was suspicious looking although still had a VERY LOW chance of being cancerous. My gynecologist should have removed just the cyst but instead removed all my female sex organs! I have been shocked and appalled that unnecessary organ removal is pretty much the norm versus the exception in Gynecology.\\nif a woman doctor would make you feel more at ease try a woman doctor, but you need a pelvic exam\\nThank you both for your quick replies!\\nSTLousigal- I\\'m so sorry you had to go through that. Did the surgeon even warn you that he might do that?\\nThe ultrasound was done on Nov. 18, but it was ordered by a gastroenterologist, so he said he didn\\'t know much of this field. The only thing he told me when I spoke to him on the phone was that he received the report which said they found a 1.8 cm cyst on my left ovary. Then asked if I preferred a specific gynecologist. I\\'m going to the one my mother has seen for  30 years. The reason I got the scan was because I\\'ve had very bad pain in that particular spot. I suspected my ovary, because I\\'ve had cysts on the left before, and my mother and sisters have had them, too. However, my primary care doctor insisted it wasn\\'t my ovary and sent me to the gastroenterologist(who said my pain and other symptoms didn\\'t match anything gastrointestinal). However, he did order a celiac panel(all negative), because I lost 45 pounds from April to November for no clear reason and the pain could have possibly been an inflamed ilium(I think that\\'s right?) My previous cysts left within a couple of cycles, but I\\'ve had this pain for 5 months now. I would just suck it up but it\\'s disrupting my daily life, as sometimes the pain is so bad, I can\\'t stand up or walk. I also can\\'t wear anything but sweats or leggings pulled up high because it\\'s very painful to have anything touch the area, not to mention bloating. Bleh!\\nRosequartz- I\\'m okay with a male doctor. As I mentioned above, my mother has seen him for quite a long time, so I think I could trust him more than a doctor I haven\\'t met. Man or woman, I wouldn\\'t feel at all okay with it.\\n\\nWould it be a good idea to call the gastroenterologist\\'s office and request a copy of my ultrasound report?\\n\\nThanks so much, both of you!!\\nit\\'s always a good idea to call and get a copy of your test results!\\nIt is odd that you lost so much weight and have had so much pain. I don\\'t think a cyst as small as yours would ordinarily cause that many issues. However, something is obviously wrong.\\n\\nAs far as my situation, I was deceived about my condition and made the mistake of trusting my gynecologist of 20 years.\\nI picked up a copy of the ultrasound report today. It states the measurement of the uterus and ovaries and says, \"In the left ovary is a 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm anechoic lesion, felt to be a dominant follicle or a simple cyst. This requires no followup. No adnexal masses or free fluid are noted. Otherwise unremarkable pelvic ultrasound.\" Which sounds like a good thing!\\nI had the same thought, STLousigal: it seems too small to do anything! And now I see it is a simple cyst, too. I guess I\\'ll keep my appointment with the gyn because the pain continues!\\n\\nThat\\'s very unfortunate about your doctor, though. I\\'m very sorry to hear that. :/ It\\'s great that you\\'re sharing your story with other women, though!!\\nYes, this is good news! I sure hope you figure out what is causing the pain!\\n\\nThank you for your kind words. I will never stop telling my story. I am appalled by the greed and inner workings of the Gynecology specialty especially as it relates to hysterectomy and oophorectomy.\\nI had to reschedule my appointment with the gynecologist and all he had was the middle of February. I\\'ll post an update after my appointment. Thanks so much for your help!!\\nHello, again!\\nMy appointment was rescheduled to this morning, so I thought I\\'d post a quick update. The doctor and his nurse were very considerate, and I didn\\'t have to do anything against my wishes!\\n\\nAs for the pain, he looked at my ultrasound report and said he believes the pain, along with my other symptoms, are from irritable bowel- not my ovary. The cyst on the scan was just the kind that you get every month, and they happened to catch it at that time.\\nThanks for your input, both of you!\\nGlad to hear you got the \"all clear\" on a gynecologic issue. Irritable bowel is sort of a \"catch all\" when they suspect a bowel issue but there is no definitive diagnosis. Sometimes identifying and eliminating problematic foods is a big help. I hope you find something to relieve the pain and address any other issues with it. If there is a possibility of Celiac disease then you would want to rule that out since that would necessitate going gluten free to prevent the cumulative damage to your small intestines.',\n",

       " {'post': 'I was recently diagnosed with Diabetes and have been a PCOS sufferer for 8 years.  I am no stranger to prolonged episodes of bleeding. But until 12 weeks ago or so I had a few years break where my periods were short and sweet and quite \"regular\" Now since my diagnoses of Diabetes and from being put on Metformin I have been bleeding non-stop for 12 weeks+ and its sooo depressing. I seen my diabetic nurse and she says prolonged bleeding isnt a side effect to metformin and it could just be coincidence and its my PCOS. But Metformin should sort this out am I right?? I feel like I am going backwards and not forwards, my sex life is taking a beating at the moment and me and my hubby are arguing alot. I am not obese but I am overweight and their is PCOS and diabetes in my family, and I have spoken to members of my family and they have had sucess with metformin. Anyone out there have similar effects with Metformin? could this be just my pcos \"acting up\"? I feel like I should just have my ovaries removed as a i feel defeated right now. I am 34 with 2 children\\nI\\'ve been bleeding for four weeks. It started as spotting in the day my period was due and since then has been getting gradually heavier. Ended up at the hosp Monday night as I lost something. ( I think I was pg but it was missed due to my hormones not rising quick enough) I\\'m waiting for a scan why I don\\'t no as they wanted to rule out pregnancy. Bleeding seems to start and stop and is worse when I\\'ve been on my feet, losing large clots too but I do when I\\'m on my period. Docs at hospital and doctors surgery both think it\\'s hormonal due to PCOS. Wish it would stop. Pain in the arse. Good luck x',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi,\\n\\nI think this is a great forum offering some great help and advice for women who are battling this terrible syndrome.\\n\\nUnfortunately my beautiful wife has suffered from PCOS for at least 10years. She is 36 and we have been married for about 2.5years. We have a 22month toddler which was a blessing as any couple knows where PCOS is concerned. While PCOS is more common in women who are overweight, my wife is actually within normal range for her age and height.\\n\\nWhile PCOS is becoming more understood and the support for women is increasing, it is easy to forget that PCOS also has a big impact on the Husband or boyfriend in a relationship.\\n\\nWhen my wife and I got together she explained to me that she had PCOS but I guess I didn\\'t truly understand how this syndrome could affect a relationship. We got pregnant quite quickly, and up until my wife became pregnant we had a strong love life. However, from the moment she became pregnant 2.5 years ago until now, we haven\\'t made love or had any intimate contact at all.\\n\\nI love my wife and even if PCOS meant we would never make love again I would still stay committed to our marriage and our child. Still, as a young, healthy guy with a strong libido, no sexual contact for 2.5 years can be difficult to cope with.\\n\\nI guess what I am struggling with isn\\'t the lack of sex but rather the lack of sensual touch.  I have tried to discuss things with my wife on several occasions and have always been extremely gentle and understanding. However, when I have tried to discuss this topic with my wife she becomes very upset and simply says she is still attracted to me but her body is broken due to the PCOS. Any mention of PCOS or our love life is simply off limits.\\n\\nMy wife hates the thought of drugs as they have side affects which aren\\'t nice and I would never push her in that direction. The thought of my wife taking those kinds of drugs for me is quite upsetting.\\n\\nI understand that with PCOS her sex drive may be non-existent and sex may even become painful and uncomfortable, however, there are many ways to maintain sexual touch and intimacy in a relationship other than intercourse.\\n\\nI try and maintain touch and affection with her as often as I can. I give her feet massages and lovingly touch and massage her in bed which she seems to like. However, she will not reciprocate the touch.\\n\\nMore generally I do my best to be a good husband and dad. My wife is a fulltime mum to our child, however, I come home early from work (before 5pm) every day without fail. I help feed, cleanup the house, bath our child and put her to bed. I get up to our baby during the night and feed her in the morning so that my wife can sleep in. I never go out and spend all my free time with my family.\\n\\nWith all this in mind, I don\\'t understand why my wife feels she cant offer any sensual touch. I will never push her and refuse to be the \"needy husband\". But surely marriage is about give and take and the enjoyment you get from seeing your partner happy.\\n\\nJust as the only enjoyment I receive from giving her foot massages etc is knowing that it makes her happy, why does she not offer intimate touch even if it is only to see me happy. It is almost as though by having no sex drive she has lost all appreciation or understanding for how I feel as a husband with a very strong sex drive, and the emotional strength I receive from being intimate with my wife.\\n\\nPCOS is obviously a complicated and painful syndrome for everyone involved. The reason why I am trying to understand the symptoms is that I love my wife. I have concluded that if PCOS means we will have little or no sex in our marriage than we need to work out how to fulfil each others most basic human needs in other ways.\\n\\nI\\'m a guy so I\\'m not very good with words and expressing my thoughts so I hope this hasn\\'t come across badly. I love my wife so much and will do anything to keep our marriage strong and healthy.\\n\\nAny experience, feedback or advice women or husbands that have been in a similar position might have would be greatly appreciated.',\n",

       " {'post': 'Hi everyone,\\n\\nI\\'ll keep this post short and sweet for the moment. I am hoping for some help and advice from everyone.\\n\\nI am currently being tested for PCOS. My doctor seems to be very sure that I have it....but I will not find out for sure until my next appointment in a months time. Unfortunately that was the earliest date I could get. I\\'ve asked to be contacted if a spot opens up for me for an earlier day...but we will see....\\n\\nIts only been about 4 days since I found out about this possible diagnosis....and I\\'m already going batty.\\nI don\\'t want to simply sit and wait a month to get treatment for something I likely have. So....me, a sugar fanatic, is going to try to swear off the sweets.\\n\\nMy question for everyone here...is what do I have to \\'look forward\\' to? Do you have any diet tips, or even a heads up regarding the medication - side effects, do the antiandrogens actually work on hair growth? And on anxiety?\\n\\nThanks everyone.\\n\\nP\\nThe first thing I would do is ask to have the blood work sent to you so that you can view the results ahead of your appointment. That way, you can see for yourself what is out of range and do your own research before meeting with the doc. Your appointment will be more constructive that way.\\n\\nDid you have your insulin and glucose levels checked?\\nNo. Not yet. I\\'m planning on bringing that up at my next appointment. I spent the last few days doing research, and suspect I may be insulin resistant due to....\\n\\na) frequent urination\\nb) my vision has recently gone blurry. Only apparently when I\\'m reading signs.\\nWhat about thyroid testing? TSH, Free T4 and Free T3 are all the important ones to have checked. There is a very strong relationship between hypothyroidism and PCOS. I am hypothyroid and have polycystic ovaries, though I don\\'t really meet the criteria for PCOS.\\n\\nYou have to be really assertive in getting all of the right tests and being treated for \"borderline\" blood work. Most doctors do not want to treat a patient if their blood tests are within range, even if they are at the far end of the range. I would do a quick search of thyroid section on this board and look for people who have PCOS and hypothyroidism. See if your symptoms sound similar.\\nI\\'m being tested for hyperthyroidism. No worries on that one. As soon as my doctor suspected PCOS, she added the thyroid tests to my lab sheet. Also had me go in for an abdominal ultrasound. I go back in for an exam and my results in a few weeks. Then ill ask about glucose tests.\\n\\nI\\'m not waiting though. I\\'m changing my diet and starting to try to exercise more.\\n\\nI will check the thyroid board. Thanks.\\nHyperthyroid - does not sound like me.\\n\\nNo, it doesn\\'t. Actually, I assumed you made a typo and meant HyPOthyroid. I don\\'t know why she would think you were hyperthyroid- there is a strong link between PCOS and hypothyroidism, not hyper. Either way, if she is checking the free thyroid hormones, FT3 and FT4, it will tell you whether you are hypo or hyper, or \"euthyroid.\"\\nwoops. My bad. Hypo does not sound like me either.\\n\\nI know shes testing me for some stuff relating to the thyroid - probably the hypo as you said.\\n\\nI have to wait until June 15th to get any kind of result. Its driving me up the wall.\\nwhy so long? can you have them send you the results when they are ready, ahead of your appt?\\nbecause thats the earliest appointment I could get. I\\'ve asked them to phone me if an earlier appointment opens up. Think I will occasionally call to check up as well.\\n\\nI suppose I could get the results, but that would not help me. I don\\'t know what the numbers mean, and knowing what the results are will not help me get treatment any faster. The doc is pretty confident that what I have is PCOS.  What I need is a diagnosis, so treatment can began, and to have a test done to check for insulin resistance.\\nI\\'ve started some \\'treatment\\' on my own - I\\'ve cold turkey dumped all gut rot and junk food from my diet, and I\\'m contemplating going on omega-3 supplements. I\\'ve also started a meal/exercise diary that I can show the doc or a nutritionist for help.....But I don\\'t think I can do a whole lot more on my own without concrete info.\\nWell. I asked them to phone me. I\\'ve tested positive.\\n\\nTested positive for what? PCOS or hypothyroidism?\\n\\nPCOS. I kind of zoned out after I heard that both the blood work and ultrasound say I have PCOS. I kinda freaked out and had to leave the office with a friend for a walk - I never expected that.\\n\\nI need to phone back to double check the thyroid levels.\\nWell, I know it\\'s hard but it\\'s good that you at least have a definitive diagnosis, so that you can treat it. PCOS really is very common and manageable. About 10% of the reproductive age female population has PCOS. I think it is very good that you are trying to cut down your sugar consumption as that is a big contributor towards the syndrome. You may also have to start metformin, since it is likely you have insulin resistance.\\nThese syndromes all seem to be tied together- insulin resistance, PCOS and hypothyroidism.  There is a question mark for me about the PCOS, since I do not have all the hormonal markers, I am not overweight and I do ovulate very predictably every 26 days. But the insulin resistance diagnosis is starting to rear its head, after many years of being told I don\\'t have it. I also have hypothyroidism. All of this is treatable. It is good that you know because now you can take steps towards becoming healthy and reversing the process. Please do not worry- this is not a scary diagnosis. You must have had some inkling that you had some of the symptoms, now you can treat them.\\nAre you trying to get pregnant? I forget.',\n",
